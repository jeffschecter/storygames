Then MikeRM asked me a troubling question "what is it about these books that I want to see in games but can't given the currently available games?" I had to realize that my post was primarily just geeking out about great stories that I'd like to play. I hadn't really been thinking about whether or not existing games were up to the task. So I'm throwing it out to everyone who enjoyed that thread. Are the existing games sufficient to do your favorites justice? If so, which ones and why? If not, why not? Do you have to tweak anything to make it work or add anything to the existing game to really get what you're looking for? Is it just setting and color you need or is it a system question?<br/><br/>I'm formulating my own thinking about the books I listed and will post as soon as its baked a little.

But the core of the problem is that you can't go back home again. By reading the book (or seeing Star Wars), you've already had that setting "play out" for you. You can't do better than the experience in the other media, in part becuase the world created for that other media was not generated for you to play characters within it that are central to the story. That's already been done by other characters. <br/>\n<br/>\nDune is classic this way. When do you play? The interesting scenario that the setting sets up has already been played out. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you need for good play is, essentially, a blank slate in terms of story. Imagine if you had a universe like that of Dune, and it was set up with you playing Paul and buddies... but Dune had never been written? Well that would be a great situation to play through. But, it having already been written, what's left to play? <br/>\n<br/>\nI say all of this having played a ton of Rolemaster in Middle Earth. It's not just that the system was terrible for the game (it is, but that's not the only problem). It's that I always felt like the story-goodness had already been used up by Tolkien. I was an interloper in his realm, at best living below the level of his stories, and at worst, sullying them with our additions. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot everyone will feel like I do. But I, too, went in thinking that it would be a great idea to play in the settings that I most loved to read or see in movies. And every time the same thing happened. That sense of potential did not pan out. <br/>\n<br/>\nWheras if I play in a setting designed for an RPG, almost all such designers do not make the mistake of sucking up the story. The world is presented as being on the cusp of something happening, but we don't know what. And it's up to you and the players to figure out that story. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo... just consider for a moment that this urge to play in established settings may not be a well-considered one, in all cases. Especially in a setting where there are world-changing events caused by the characters in the fiction, you may well find, as I have, that play is flat and lifeless. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why Jihad works, in my opinion. It's NOT Dune. It sets up situations and elements that are "Dunesque" perhaps, and that's all good. But it doesn't try to actually reside in Dune. Just as Burning Wheel doesn't actually try to reside in Middle Earth, despite it being a complete homage to that realm. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust sayin'<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arref" title="Arref"><img alt="Arref" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nX3VMQSRREUB5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arref">Arref</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99454/#Comment_99454" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T07:27:32+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  7:27AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a lot of 'good' in what you're saying.<br/><br/>OTOH, I can think of plenty of fiction worlds were the 'future' is not played out.

The same feeling could come from the advisors of Queen Elizabeth at the start of her reign, or maybe the early years of the Rebel alliance.<br/><br/>There are a few new games capable of delivering this, I think. Burning Wheel has circles and resources, which are very useful for this kind of situation. Jihad and Burning Empires add some campaign level stakes to the game.

And certainly not during the time of the war of the Ring.  It would be absurd, unless you were specifically desiring a game about the "little people" caught up in that mess... which actually could possibly be pretty interesting.  An "Orc's Eye View" of the war.  Hmmm...<br/>But anyway, the books I mentioned on the other thread (China Mieville's Bas-Lag novels) don't really have that kind of feeling for me.  Big shit is happening, but no one really notices and the world isn't changed all that much.  At the end of Perdido Street Station, New Crobuzon is pretty much the same as it always was.  Those stories are the kind where the big players overshadow everything, except perhaps in their own little circles.  But when it comes down to it anyway, more than I actually want to play IN New Crobuzon, what I really want is to play a game that creates a story that FEELS like those stories feel.  And that is a task that I think is both easier and more difficult than just playing a game in a certain setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99469/#Comment_99469" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T08:47:10+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  8:47AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>it's all about technology and the consequences of technology,</blockquote>OK, thanks. I hadn't really zoomed in on that yet.<br/><br/>Mike, I agree with much of what you say. Though if Pendragon can do it, surely it can't be all bad?<br/><br/>I still think that the Culture novels would be good, though. There's not the giant meta-plot on the whole, just an interesting universe with lots of different examples of the kinds of stories that could play out. Similarly with Lovecraft: lots of little stories build up to present an interesting setting with lots of room for manoeuvre. Not to mention fertile unconsistencies and omissions, something many game designers wouldn't think to include. Maybe the moral is to look at story collections, rather than epic series?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99527/#Comment_99527" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T12:25:30+00:00" title="September 27, 2007 12:25PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Are the existing games sufficient to do your favorites justice?

People have been gaming Amber for years, even working round the great universe-changing cosmic events of the canon; those events become creative constraints (though I think a lot of Amber games start out with "only X books are canon, we're starting from that point"). It probably helps that Amber as a series was never actually finished, it just stopped.<br/><br/>Going back to the question of the thread, I have to admit that the main reason I'm developing the Pentasystem as I am is so that it will support the kinds of stories I like: stories that depict people trying to change the world because of things they care about, while dealing with their own issues, having to suffer and sacrifice in order to do so, and ending up changed by the experience. With plenty of scope for quirky weird stuff that isn't what the story is actually about, but adds a ton of flavour and without which the story wouldn't be quite the same (or might not occur at all). My design goals are specifically and explicitly to support creating that kind of story, and if I can play games that feel like Lois McMaster Bujold, Jim Butcher, Sherri Tepper, Julian May, maybe even Terry Pratchett, I'll know I've succeeded.<br/><br/>Why can't I do this with PTA, TSOY, FATE, FLFS or Dogs? [EDIT: or Shock?] Well, I probably could, kind of, but then, I can open a can of paint with a claw hammer, too. I want to build a tool (which steals unashamedly the most applicable bits from all those games) which is designed to support "my kind of story", from the ground up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99611/#Comment_99611" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T17:01:30+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  5:01PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>PTA is not narrativist, or every game is.

Before this gets out of hand I'm going to quote from the Glossary over at The Forge:<br/><br/>Narrativism (Narrativist play)<br/>One of the three currently-recognized Creative Agendas. See Story Now.<br/><br/>Story Now<br/>Commitment to Addressing (producing, heightening, and resolving) Premise through play itself. The epiphenomenal outcome for the Transcript from such play is almost always a story. One of the three currently-recognized Creative Agendas. As a top priority of role-playing, the defining feature of Narrativist play.<br/><br/>Premise (adapted from Egri)<br/>A generalizable, problematic aspect of human interactions. Early in the process of creating or experiencing a story, a Premise is best understood as a proposition or perhaps an ideological challenge to the world represented by the protagonist's passions. Later in the process, resolving the conflicts of the story transforms Premise into a theme - a judgmental statement about how to act, behave, or believe. In role-playing, "protagonist" typically indicates a character mainly controlled by one person. A defining feature of Story Now.<br/><br/>Hope this helps.<br/><br/>Jesse<br/><br/>Edited Note: In my experience PtA Character Issue in action = Premise.  Therefore PtA is a Narrativist game by default as players are expected to address their Character's Issue over the course of the game                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99616/#Comment_99616" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T17:46:28+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  5:46PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't agree. It's perfectly possible under the PTA rules with no changing to only address the characters' Issues in a simulative way - in other words, "how would a TV show operating under these constraints and with this situation presented have this character address this issue in this way" or "how would this character resolve this situation and how can I describe it so it sounds badass and would make a great TV show". The latter in fact is more supported, by the fan mail mechanic.  Narrativism is entirely and only about moral judgments and statments made <i>by the players.</i> There is no requirement in PTA for <i>a player</i> to make any such judgment or statement. You can play it in the same way you play GURPS or D&amp;D and I suspect many or most do, and I have observed it many times.<br/><br/>In other words, and to get this back on course a little, simulating a dramatic piece of literature in which a moral dilemma happens to appear is not narrativism unless the players make and express a moral judgment.  Not the characters, the designer, the game, the genre, the format or the situation.  Because a lot of genres require some degree of moral dilemmas (sometimes very strictly confined sorts, sometimes with very strictly defined resolutions), this can get foggy unless you keep very careful track of whether the player is making a moral judgment and statement, or just resolving a situation in the fiction.  <br/><br/>In a Gulliver's Travels-esque game, for example, there would be many ways to react as players to the allegories for the absurdities of political and social life:<br/><br/>1 - The player could just have the character react as that character would react in those situations. Not narrativism: no moral statement.<br/><br/>2 - The player could have the character "play along" with the allegory, feeding into the absurdity but also incorporating their character into it.  Not narrativism: the character and even the narration may be making a moral statement, but it's just at the level of the genre, "in the game world", so to speak.<br/><br/>3 - The player could have the character "play along" with the allegory but make it clear from their narration and description that the character is not fully aware of the allegory and in fact makes dreadful mistakes or apologizes for brilliant maneuvers, thinking they're mistakes. Narrativism: the player has made a moral statement about the allegory and the underlying reality through play of the character.<br/><br/>This is why I don't think narrativist games are necessary for "playing" most of great literature.  (This is also why I don't think GNS is worth much.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99641/#Comment_99641" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T20:30:28+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  8:30PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Um....Can I make a stealth roll and sneak out the back?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99642/#Comment_99642" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T20:32:26+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  8:32PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Save vs GNS Flamewar!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99694/#Comment_99694" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T06:17:15+00:00" title="September 28, 2007  6:17AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd take the time to disagree with you, JD, except that it's really off topic for this thread. But I will agree with you that narrativism isn't required for "playing" literature, as you put it. Nobody ever said it was. It's not "story" for a reason (we all shot Ron down when he tried to claim it was), it's "Story Now." <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that Pendragon doesn't "do" the Arthur thing. It specifically gives you something else to do... be a more lowly knight in the setting working his way up. Even then I'm not convinced that it works well. Playing the "little people" as proposed above is what Ron has called "Underbelly Play." And while it's viable, I think, I don't see why there's any compelling reason to use the particular backdrop if you're going to do underbelly play... what do you gain over using any other setting? My point being that these settings exist and were created to facilitate the stories of the characters created. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact of the nature of the existence of Middle Earth as a linguistics excercise notwithstanding. Yes, Tolkien invented the elvish first, and then created a world to put it in. But he did so because he believed that a realistic language cannot exist without a mythic underpinning which explains the evolution of the language (and we'd be fools to defy the professor). As such, Middle Earth exists only insamuch as it supports the myths that create the language, and a lot of it is left undefined. In other words, if you're not playing those myths out, the set up isn't really all that useful for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut all that said, I agree with the more general point that some books are more suitable than others. I think to the extent that a world is used for episodic stuff, as opposed to epic, the more likely it is to be useful. For instance I think that Hyperborea, as presented to use as somewhat of a travellogue in the Conan books makes a relatively fine place to play. Which is because many of Conan's stories are about simply visiting places, not altering them. Don't get me wrong, playing King of Aquilonia is all used up. But there are many places that are just places where you could have play occur without worrying about having to trample over the Conan themes (or simply repeat them, which is even less interesting). <br/>\n<br/>\nBut in this case, there's actually so little material involved that it's pretty much as easy to make up your own setting. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the key: the settings that are created in books and media are done so to support the author's needs in terms of creating situations for the characters. Which he then proceeds to use up. The Star Wars universe is so obviously this way: Lucas creates whatever he needs the moment he needs it. The universe exists solely to enable the telling of the Skywalker Saga. It sets up a situation of a burgeoning palace revolution and subsequent rebellion. This situation then gets "played out" in the movies. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing "left over" from this process are the creative trappings of the setting... what the aliens look like. But... what does Greedo's home culture look like? Are there other Hutts? Or is Jabba just some sort of mutant? Is Hutt a race? Or a position? OK, I think that one of the movies made after Jedi does actually have more of Jabba's species, which I think we're to assume are also called Hutts? But that's odd. Why is Han not, then, Han the Human? Are they rare? <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, now somebody will come on and assure me that there's secondary literature in which all of this is explained well, and in which we find out that Chewbacca is female, and what her home culture is like. Know what? I've never read that. And, as such, it's not even slightly compelling to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nMoreover, there's no situation in Star Wars that is presented that needs playing out. Sure, I as GM can make one up. But making up the trappings is pretty fun... and learning about them. After all we didn't all go to Star Wars knowing what he aliens would look like. Why should we want to play in a world just because we already know what the aliens will look like? Why not be surprised instead? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not create those trappings the same way that Lucas does (I find it to be a fun act)? And if you have to come up with a situation yourself for the players to deal with, then what are you getting from the setting in the book? <br/>\n<br/>\nBaggage. That's all you get, from what I've seen of such play. The negatives, to me, seem to either balance out, or even outweigh the small positives. The perception that it's going to be very fun to play in these settings is proved wrong after the first couple of sessions. "Look, there's one of those Greedo-guys! Cool! Let's go shoot him like Han did!" <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd really rather just play in a setting that starts with the notion of existing primarily to support the action that's going on around the characters. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet's put it this way: my actual play in settings from books has blown chunks. Can somebody give me an example of play from a setting from a book that was good... because the setting was from the book? As opposed to being good because the GM or system came up with a way to work around the fact that the setting had been all used up? <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, in Amber... how do you deal with the existence of the canon Amberites? I know there are actually several solutions to this. But all of them seem to come down to not being able to either actually use the setting as it was written, or having to play "underbelly" which means not getting the support of the setting to play the sorts of themes for which the setting was created. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I hear reports of people having fun in these settings, they always smack of them having fun *despite* the setting, not because of it. What's fun about Amber is not the details of the setting, I'd argue, but the basic premise of playing godlike beings. Nobilis, anyone? Why play in the Amber universe, when you can play in the virgin territory of the Nobilis universe? Does "the Pattern" make playing in Amber somehow compelling? <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, obviously not for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99705/#Comment_99705" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T06:56:44+00:00" title="September 28, 2007  6:56AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's funny...when I hear reports of people having fun in these settings, they always smack of them having fun.  Period, full stop.<br/><br/>In other words, if you think most (if not all) people playing in an established setting are having fun *despite* the setting, that's probably just a little bit of projection on your part.  You think that playing with things you made up totally on the fly is more fun than playing with things that were made up in advance, or that a "generic" setting is more fun and useful than one based on a series of books or movies?  Well, that's totally fine...but ultimately that's just <i>your</i> preference, and not anything more wide-reaching, significant, or interesting than that.  You can keep your preference and still accept that there are other people who prefer different things.<br/><br/>Other people get their kicks from being creative within established boundaries.  Still others get off on "out-<i>Amber</i>ing-<i>Amber</i>."  Some (and here's where my own personal preferences make me wonder what the hell is wrong with these people) even like playing characters from the source material, or playing PCs who interact with the characters from the source material.  Strange but true!  (Personally, that's something that I find totally unappealing, but I won't pretend that other groups aren't out there playing with Harry Potter or Luke Skywalker or Corwin running around in their game.  They're welcome to their fun, even if I would rather jam a spork in my eyes than do it in one of our games.)<br/><br/>There's a lot more going on with what people get from using a particular work's setting over another than just baggage and material that's been "used up."  There's probably even more going on with it than just saving the time and effort of creating details for the setting, or making it easier for a gaming group to arrive at a consensus for what the setting is like, or even playing directly into the daydreamy "wouldn't it be cool if?" relationship a lot of people have with their favorite literature/movie/videogame/whatever.  I wouldn't even try to sit down and work out all the reasons why groups favor one setting over another, because I don't think I'd ever come up with a complete list; it's a better use of my time to look at the settings <i>my</i> group likes, and use that to guesstimate what other settings will resonate with us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99707/#Comment_99707" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T07:04:22+00:00" title="September 28, 2007  7:04AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2007 7:05AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Accouting (do you have a name, BTW?)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could be right.

I am typically not trying to replicate anything's "feel", since, as above, I don't feel anything, what I am doing is taking the pieces of others works and assembling them to my own ends, like an artist (musical, visual) uses pre-existing material, sometimes sparingly, sometimes expansively, sometimes to poke fun at the original material, or make a point about it, or sometimes just to celebrate it.<br><br>Also, there's plenty of novels and stories that follow formula so pleasantly that if you get the formula and the trappings, <i>you have the literature</i>.  Hardboiled mystery novels, men's action, historical romance...if I write a Sherlock Holmes story, I can do it absolutely by the numbers, enjoy it greatly, and if I'm skillful, Holmes fans will like it too, not as a deconstruction, but as the actual thing itself. There have been Holmes stories after Doyle that I thought were actually more "genuinely" Holmes than some of Doyle's! <br><br/>I agree that nobody can replicate a story just by replicating a setting. Doyle didn't create a London full of bizarre mastermind criminals and wacked-out conspiracies just for fun, he did it so that Holmes and Watson could solve crimes, and not just any crimes, these particular crimes, and not just these particular crimes any old way, he made it so they would solve these particular crimes these particular ways.  But that doesn't mean the characters, conspiracies, conceits, and even the physical trappings (violin, pipe, magnifying glass, dressing gown) don't have any emotional cachet (for those of you that have emotions) or meaning independent of the plot.<br/><br/>I mean, when Michael Chabon writes a Holmes story with the Holocaust in it, you know you are looking at some awesome shit and real literary hoohah.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99750/#Comment_99750" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T10:11:41+00:00" title="September 28, 2007 10:11AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2007 11:15AM by Rob Donoghue.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder how much the completest instinct conflicts with the ability to enjoy a setting.  I have had absolutely fantastic Amber games that have drawn directly from the canon, and I know of many others who have as well.  Most often, when doing so, they are answering some question that the books themselves did not, but it varies.  I've also had some fantastic games that used amber as a starting point and went someplace crazy with it.  The rub is that I still consider those Amber game, whereas a purist, or someone who demands the text be reference, not a starting point, would probably not.  So it goes, but it points to something else - Zelazny is easier to play with than Tolkein, because Tolkein 's work is pretty well filled out (as are some classic settings, like Dune).  Zelazny's worlds are full of holes and interesting characters, and are just damn short.  That makes it a lot easier to bend them without breaking them, so to speak.  I mention this because my overall success rate with settings correlates more with how their presented than their source. I work better with bones than with a full body of work, simple as that. <br/><br/>Anyway, back to the topic at hand, I think that the game that will shake the gaming worl dto its bones will be based on Dianne Gabaldon's <i>Outlander</i> series, but I am not entirely sure how to systemize it in a way to do it justice.  I mean, any generic engine could work, but I can't see one as a better than 80% match, with the last 20% being what I want to see.<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>PS - For those unaware, they're a series of romance novels.  They're also full of pirates, time travel, black powder, swordfights and dialog that feels like the banter that Eddings was shooting for.

As opposed to being good because the GM or system came up with a way to work around the fact that the setting had been all used up?</blockquote>\nThat last bit is actually what I meant by "gamifying" a book. You can't play Frodo and the Quest; Tolkien already did that. But its setting is deep and rich and evocative. There's narrative gold there that Tolkien just left out there. Noble's Middle Earth games come to mind as fantastic use of the world Tolkien created, but he had to work at the setting and make it his. He set it a couple thousand years before the Ring story and said Go! That does away with all the canon and allows new things to happen, and the things that happen are made better because the players know what "should" have happened. Paul Tevis mentioned killing smaug 1700 years before he meets Bilbo. My Tolkien-fu isn't good enough, but someone with a black belt in hobbit could have fun rolling the ages forward with Smaug dead and see how that changes the history. For one thing, I know the Dwarves aren't driven from the Misty Mountains by a big flamey dragon. What does that do to the world? To me that's gamifying Tolkien.<br/><br/>Steerpike runs a great trilogy of Star Wars games using SOTC. Again they're set in the years when the rebel alliance is just forming (after the clone wars I think, but the Force has never been strong with me). He breaks open the canon in places where it interferes with fun like we were all Jedi's because without Jedi's there's no lightsaber battles and "lightsaber battles are awesome!" Plus, we completely ignored Episode ick! Ickier! and Ickiest! There's Sith all over the place wielding ancient glowing red sabers and there's lots of swash buckling goodness. The dark force tempts. The good fall or persevere.  That's gamified Lucas!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99772/#Comment_99772" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T11:43:51+00:00" title="September 28, 2007 11:43AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the comments all. One at a time...<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian, I'm saying that if I'm feeling the urge to play in the Star Wars universe, it's because of the movies I've seen. Not because I'm vaguely aware that there are all sorts of other Star Wars novels and such that are out there that make the universe larger. How do I know if they make the universe better or worse, if I haven't read them? I suspect, in fact, that they make the universe worse. But whether or not that's true, it's not this material that's making me want to play in the Star Wars universe. <br/>\n<br/>\nRich, that's a very accurate restatement. Go for it. I will say, however, that Nobilis does have a crap system, and that it wouldn't surprise me if that's the cause for the game sinking. The example is just to point out that it's not difficult to find replacement "settings" especially when that word here really means "What we do" less than "Where do we do it?" Same for Arthurian knights. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoe, James and JD, you all give examples of the setting having to be altered to have fun playing in the world chosen, using one of the two most common methods: changing the timeframe to before or after the time of the books in question. In point of fact, when I played in Middle Earth, we played in the classic "1600s" version. I have two replies to this:<br/>\nA) This was precisely my point. You're avoiding playing during the peak set-up, the one with the most support, because you understand implicitly that it would be no fun to play during that peak period, because it's been all used up situationally. <br/>\n<br/>\nB) Despite playing in 1600s ME, it didn't help. At one point we wandered on over to the Anduin vale, and started to hear rumors of somebody in Mirkwood known as the Necromancer. Now I'm not usually one to want for secrets in the game, but the fact that I knew this was Sauron, and nobody else in the world of ME at that time knew this, blew. In fact, in this case knowing this really messed up my play. Do we go in and try to destroy this evil despot? That's probably something my do-gooder Dunedain Ranger character would probably have done. But, then, I also know that this is Sauron, and that we'd have gotten our posteriors handed to us, because even at the time, he's still a maiar, and waaaaay more powerful than we are. But even worse than that... what if we succeed in some fashion? Then the history of Middle Earth is altered forever and in a massive way? We're going to re-write Tolkien for the better? <br/>\n<br/>\nI think not. I often felt like I was running over Tolkien's work. <br/>\n<br/>\nHeck, playing Star Wars 40,000 years prior to the movies? Is that Star Wars at all? They had lightsabres then? Who knew? And in any case, where's that compelling part? Rather, why not use some other universe? What are we getting out of saying it's Star Wars at that point? And if I have to break canon to get the lightsabres in, then, again, isn't the canon just causing work here? <br/>\n<br/>\nJD... the "real world" has the advantage that it can't get "used up." It's not a "setting" in terms of being something special with which to engage. It's not created for a specific situation, it contains all real situations. It can't be the draw for play alone. I completely agree with you that if you're playing Holmsian mysteries, that the trappings of such are the draw. I think a RPG that emulates Holmsian Mysteries is great. Again, I don't have a problem with a game like Burning Wheel where it's "Middle Earth" emulative (if you will). I have a problem playing in Middle Earth, the setting. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I'd go so far as to say that I wouldn't even have a problem playing Sherlock Holmes himself... sounds like a fun game (I hope it's not a poison berry). But that's because Holmes was never "resolved" thematically. Yes, he dies (or, at least Doyle tried to kill him), but each episode has nothing to do with that eventual death. As such, many more fun episodes of Holmes can be written/played. Hercule Poirot is proof of that, I think. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that's, again, because each episode is it's own situation. You're not relying on "London" to provide the situation, you're having to create it each time yourself (the mystery in this case). <br/>\n<br/>\nRob, I might be that completist. Somebody who doesn't think as much of Tolkien might not have my problem. But, then, they also have less compulsion to play in that setting and another should serve as well, I'd think. In any case, I'd stipulate to Amber being less problematic than Middle Earth or Dune, yeah. Because, like Holmes, it's less about the setting, really, and more about the sort of action going on. But, again, then why not use a different setting, and avoid the problems entirely? <br/>\n<br/>\nYou might surmise this isn't the first time this subject has come up... I've done this thread once or twice before. Not seeing anything new here... yet. Keep it coming. We might yet prove me wrong. And then I get to play in Middle Earth again!<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99779/#Comment_99779" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T11:56:00+00:00" title="September 28, 2007 11:56AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Somebody who doesn't think as much of Tolkien might not have my problem.

Most of the compelling reinventions of the setting do not reframe the cosmology, they reframe the characters.  And Zelazny knocked it out of the park in terms of creating well realized characters with only a few brush strokes, which allows their situation to be changed drastically while still keeping the character strongly recognizable.  So long as part of the appeal of the settingis playing something that _relates_ to these characters, you have huge flexibility. Even in their absence, they impact the setting so long as you can see a chain between what you're doing and the character.  That chain is part of what makes it, for example, so easy to move an Amber game forward or backwards in time.<br/><br/>Now, all -that- said, Amber is a perfect storm of a setting.  Almost purely character driven, hugely flexible in setting, and compact (90% of what you need is in the first book, which is _tiny_.  The entirety of the first series is still smaller than a Wheel of Time book).  It's also easy to point to concrete examples of its utility as a setting, if only through the sheer persistence of the community.  I am constantly on the lookout for another setting that allows this same range of capabilities, and I still haven't found it.  Most tellingly, what makes it work is probably not going to make Middle Earth work for you, simple as that.<br/><br/>I dunno. It really feels like you think that respecting the original work is contradictory to taking strong ownership of it.  And I see the thinking behind  it, but it's not a perspective I  share.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99781/#Comment_99781" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T12:04:01+00:00" title="September 28, 2007 12:04PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2007 12:09PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Edited to account for cross-post with Rob]<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd agree, Shreyas, except that nobody has provided me with convincing evidence to the contrary. <br/>\n<br/>\nTruth be told, I'm actually expecting to get that proof soon.

"Underbelly", which I have thought was interesting since I first read a short story set in Gotham City all about the tailor who sews the outfits for the Arkham villains (it's hard to find a green suit with question marks all over it, you know), is a subset of the "new situation" that we have to concoct no matter what we do.  It's not the only game in town by any means.<br/><br/>Some people have a very hard time coming up with a new situation for some works. They feel highly constrained by the existing works.  It sounds like Middle Earth is that way for you.  There was a very memorable rpg.net thread regarding playing in Narnia that springs to mind, a giant debate over whether you could not have Aslan appear and still be playing in Narnia.  <br/><br/>I've always felt that the moment you make new characters in a setting, you have changed it irrevocably and probably whoever came up with the setting would hate you forever if they found out what you had done with it, so I was never really concerned with fidelity to the source material.  (The real question is why I assumed they would hate it and hate me rather than love it and love me. Probably because I was on Usenet a long time....anyway.)<br/><br/>In other words, I am not that interested if, when I decide to have Aslan not appear, or be more Buddha-like instead of Christ-like, or a lamb instead of a lion, if I am still "playing in Narnia", I am interested in whether it is a good or compelling idea. So I guess I come at established settings from the opposite side that you do - I already assume I've dynamited it and there's nothing left but pieces when I start campaign design.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean that sometimes I don't use a hell of a lot of the pieces!  I've run Gotham City comics games that strictly paralleled comic book canon, incorporated tons of characters from the comics and integrated the PCs into as fully-realized a version of the setting as I possibly could.  (Does it matter that Gotham City is the collective creation of many dozens of writers and artists over many decades? Hm!)  I mean, I kept to that setting like a hawk chasing a rabbit.  Still, I had to find a "new situation" for the players to play in. There's no question about that.<br/><br/>Is this wishy washy enough? Let me know. Also I don't agree that you can treat the real world as distinct here. It's just another highly detailed setting that people know more or less about. The stories we find in history can be just as limited or just as open as fictional stories. But perhaps there is a difference that I'm just not seeing yet...<br/><br/>It occurs to me that maybe a 'how I design a campaign from a highly detailed setting source' thread might be of use to people?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99785/#Comment_99785" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T12:18:13+00:00" title="September 28, 2007 12:18PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never really seen the difference between playing in canonical fictional world and playing in a purely historical context.

At minimum the pure game question of can the PCs extract this guy before Vader shows up and kills everyone is an interesting question but then so is the central question of is this guy worth saving or his he too far gone also an interesting question.

Yes, it is definitely Star Wars. They have lightsabers. The compelling part is how many different visions of the Force we have from the canon characters of the first three movies (not counting the added confusion of the second three.) The game will test a few truths about the Force and the victory of the Republic. Perhaps Palpatine was right. Perhaps Luke was right. Perhaps Yoda was.

I mean, sure it can be fun to invent your own details about what the aliens and spaceships and nifty sci-fi tech looks like and how it all works, but sometimes it cool just be able able to say, "Yeah, there's a wookie rushing toward you howling and waving a bowcaster," and know that everyone knows what you're talking about.  And if we're not playing in "The Star Wars Universe" and I describe a character as wielding a "lightsaber" everyone is going to give me a weird look and say, "What the hell, man?"

I would have a hard time making changes to some of his best work, but I have no real problem whacking Amber until the candy comes out. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Here's the practical question.  That you can make a setting that does everything you need from tolkein is something I can take as a given.  Not even a question.  What is a question is how well it captures what other people want out of Tolkien, and how well it conveys that image to the players?  Obviously, it will succeed to some extent, but those are non-trivial hurdles.  That creates a pretty simple opportunity/cost question.  Is the cognitive dissonance of using the setting-as-written more or less disruptive than capturing  and expressing the spirit of that setting in some other way?<br/><br/>Answers will vary, certainly, based on tolerance, and on what people want out of a setting.  For some people, as long as there are jedi, starships and lightsabers then a game is star wars.  For others, the full texture of Lucas's mythology is necessary.  Int he case of middle earth, I think you get doubly screwed with Middle Earth, because its completeness is part of the package right alongside elves and hobbits and rangers and wizards..  If you try to do a middle earth which does not have that depth, you lose what is an essential part of the setting for some, including yourself (though for someone who cares less about that element? Elves, hobbits, rangers and wizards? We're ready to rock!)<br/><br/>Sorry man. I think you're hosed. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Anyway, I think that it's well worth advising that people stop and think about what it is they actually want from a setting, and consider whether the game can provide that for them.  Personally, I can't conceive of a Use of Weapons RPG, despite the fact that its premise is very gameable, because the parts that compel me are things I don't see a path to finding at the table, and because of that, my love of Use of Weapons would become a _detriment_ were I attempt to play it, because things would not only be bad, they would be _wrong_.  And maybe I'm shooting myself in the foot here.  I suspect there are some rocking Use of Weapons games out there in the gameosphere, even if they're not for me.  What I _do_ wonder is if it's really insurmountable, or if I'm just killing my own fun, but I've got no practical way to answer that.<br/><br/>But on the flipside, most of these questions and concerns are true of _any_ setting, whether from a novel, a movie, an RPG book or that scarily thick binder the GM is toting around, except perhaps that people may be more passionate about their favorite fiction. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99794/#Comment_99794" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T12:34:36+00:00" title="September 28, 2007 12:34PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2007 12:36PM by noclue.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>A) This was precisely my point. You're avoiding playing during the peak set-up, the one with the most support, because you understand implicitly that it would be no fun to play during that peak period, because it's been all used up situationally.<br/></blockquote>\nWell, I never disagreed with this point. My point is something else, that a game based on a setting can be a great springboard for a cool experience (either through system or session design). How and when and why you attack it in designing the fun is up to individuals, but the fact that you're in Tolkien's ME 1600 can enhance the experience, not only impede play.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>At one point we wandered on over to the Anduin vale, and started to hear rumors of somebody in Mirkwood known as the Necromancer. Now I'm not usually one to want for secrets in the game, but the fact that I knew this was Sauron, and nobody else in the world of ME at that time knew this, blew. In fact, in this case knowing this really messed up my play.</blockquote>\nWell, that's a problem in the set up. I've played lots of games where I as a player know something and my character doesn't. The dramatic irony can be very fun if handled right. Why not just say "Obviously this is the time when Sauron is rising in Mirkwood." Let the players decide if they want to investigate the evil god or fight other stuff. Or set up a quest doing something else and keep having rumors of the LOTR backstory keep emerging, saying "If your characters knew what we know, you'd recognize this as the beginning of the fall of Moria. Which leads to a big Balrog v. Wizard smackdown two thousand years later. But this is not that story... actually Noble does this very thing in his game. He'll step back and say something like "This tower is the same tower that will, 2000 years from today, fall in a great battle between....but today it still stands regal and proud. (If we destroy the Tower? I guess it won't fall 2000 years from today.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>But, then, I also know that this is Sauron, and that we'd have gotten our posteriors handed to us, because even at the time, he's still a maiar, and waaaaay more powerful than we are. </blockquote>\nAnd yet. Little Frodo was brave enough to tackle bastard. Foiled his evil plots.\n<blockquote> But even worse than that... what if we succeed in some fashion? Then the history of Middle Earth is altered forever and in a massive way? We're going to re-write Tolkien for the better?</blockquote>\nYes! Definitely! You can't play Tolkien's book. Its static, fixed for all eternity. You have to create something else with the material. Better? I'll leave judgement aside. Its like saying my cake doesn't look as pretty as the cake in the magazine. You can't eat the magazine.<br/><br/>Why avoid creating a piece of game fiction because it can't live up to the fiction created by a SF master that has been read by generations? You ain't "rewriting" anything. Its not like you're replacing those novels with yoru own. They stay on the bookshelf and you still get to read that work any time you please. Maybe your Dunedain ranger takes out Sauron...cool! why not? Maybe you get toasted by Sauron...cool! Why not?<br/><br/>You know what Tolkien would say if he were alive today? He'd say "leave me alone! You people are nuts. Its just a story. Its not a treatise against the Man, or nuclear war or technology. I wrote other things, too. Good things. I never expected all this attention. I just want to live the quiet life of an academic and you Beatle-loving hippies won't leave me and my wife in peace..." Well, that's not helpful. He's derailing our thread.

I can play Tolkien-esque. Or Dune-esque. <br/>\n<br/>\nJames, your question is "Why not?" Well I'm telling you again, I tried it, and even asking the question sucked. I think it's because I want to be creating new themes. Fighting evil old Sauron? It's been done, and done best. I can't do it better than that. I've eaten that cake already; it's not in the magazine, it's in my belly. And even a good imitation of that cake? Well it's not my idea, then. I want these things to be things I'm creating, not repeating. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, on the other hand, if we're playing Midnight, I have no problem with my character going off after that dark lord. In fact, I'd use HQ, and I'd definitely go for it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know a bit about Noble's game, since it was I who helped him figure out how to run it to some extent on the Forge (he thanked me for the help at GenCon). If it ran well, cool; he did it despite me warning that I thought that it wouldn't work well for several reasons. But, again, that doesn't change the fact that you guys didn't play the Middle Earth setting from LOTR. You played one separated from that by 2000 years. And there's a reason why. My point isn't that you can't play in these settings if you alter them significantly, you can. It's just that, to the extent that it's still linked to the book setting it's problematic (at least for me), and to the extent that it's not, you lose any benefits like the ones that Brian mentions about common language and such. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then you're back at the point where you're as well off using a custom made setting. Because, Rob, how many Tolkien rip-off settings have you yourself created. For my own part, I've made a half-dozen. And they all worked just as well. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that I'll admit right off the bat that one of the reasons that the ME game didn't work for me is that we were playing Rolemaster (no, not even MERP, it was RM). Which emulates Tolkien not at all well (Illusionists?). Had I been playing with HQ? Who can say? But even reading the LUG Dune, I was like, "So we play before the books start? I don't want to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that to a large extent the problem is that I don't see the books as valuable for their setting... I find setting to be cheap and easy to construct and get into. The thing that makes Dune incredible is the set-up situation, which causes the outcome. When I want to play in LOTR, I'm not thinking, "Gee, I want to wander around Middle Earth," I'm thinking, "Gee, I want to play a game about confronting Sauron as he rises from Mordor." And then I rightaway think, "But that's no fun, it's already been done." The urge is to catch that same lighthing in a bottle that is the confluence of the setting and situation. But this has already been done, and we know that recreating the lightning is a hollow act. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause for a player like myself, at least, I have to be making a creative statement with my play. If I'm just going through the motions, that's not going to cut it for me. So I don't want LOTR... I want a game that's LOTR-esque. And for that, a whole new setting is what works for me. Oh, I'll beg, borrow, and steal... all mythmaking does that, especially Tolkien's. But I have to make it mine in the process. And that's not going to happen for me in Middle Earth. Or, at least, it never has. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99841/#Comment_99841" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T15:13:01+00:00" title="September 28, 2007  3:13PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2007 3:13PM by Dave Hallett.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At first I thought my experience contradicted Mike, but on reflection maybe not.<br/><br/>My group did play Amber, and we did have a great time.

Declare-esque game of Mortal Coil once. Different espionage agencies had different styles of magic based on their heritage. It was all weird.

Declare done with Mortal Coil would rock. In fact, I want to play that game.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite><br/>You played one separated from that by 2000 years. And there's a reason why. My point isn't that you can't play in these settings if you alter them significantly, you can. It's just that, to the extent that it's still linked to the book setting it's problematic (at least for me), and to the extent that it's not, you lose any benefits like the ones that Brian mentions about common language and such.</blockquote>\nBut...it was a blast! It rocked hard core! I'm not being clear above, the game was enhanced, made better, more exciting, more alive, by the fact that it <i>was</i> set in Tolkien's world. We had all of Tolkien's work to draw upon before that era. That's thousands of years back to the creation myth. And as players we could oooh! and aaah! as we saw things that we recognized from the written canon (fighting the Evil Witch King for example, or destroying Smaug) and we could imagine how we just changed <i>everything</i>. Any act we took, changed <i>everything!</i>.

I find setting to be cheap and easy to construct and get into. The thing that makes Dune incredible is the set-up situation, which causes the outcome. When I want to play in LOTR, I'm not thinking, "Gee, I want to wander around Middle Earth," I'm thinking, "Gee, I want to play a game about confronting Sauron as he rises from Mordor." And then I rightaway think, "But that's no fun, it's already been done." The urge is to catch that same lighthing in a bottle that is the confluence of the setting and situation. But this has already been done, and we know that recreating the lightning is a hollow act.</blockquote>\nWell, that explains why I've had so much trouble trying to figure out where you're coming from...I'm totally the opposite.  Constructing a set-up situation and thinking about its potential outcomes is easy and fun for me, but constructing a setting is finicky and boooOOOOOooring.  Consequently, I think that books (and movies, and videogames, and magazine articles) are hugely valuable for their settings.  I delight in good settings the way a vulture delights in a roadkill-strewn highway: it's a glorious buffet of stuff to choose from, a tasty liver there and a delicious eyeball there, and I'm free to fly in and pick only what I want, when I want it.<br/><br/>It works for me.  With something like Star Wars, I don't have to re-invent the wheel when it comes to a space opera game about laser-sword wielding ninjas with psychic powers, and explain their history, significance, philosophy, or mechanics: I can say "Jedi," and my friends will get it.  And if I make changes in the "established" settings (post Ep. IV, or during Knights of the Old Republic, or an alternate version of the Clone Wars), we can discuss just what's different from the setting we're all familiar with rather than have to describe everything from top to bottom.  It saves us a lot of time.  Totally worth it to me, and we've had dozens of awesome gaming experiences using settings which I personally would describe as "Star Wars" or "Amber" or whatever (because we used the setting, with tweaks).  Whether you'd agree that they really were Star Wars or Amber games, I don't know...but then, I suppose we don't really have to agree on that.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/><br/>However, I'm right there with you on the futility of trying to catch the same lightning in a bottle.  I don't want to run or play in a game where Luke Skywalker destroys the Death Star, or Arthur Dent escapes the destruction of the Earth and ends up going to Magrathea.  It's been done well already, and arguably better than our gaming group is going to do it, so why bother?  I'm cool with "-esque"ing it, filing off the serial numbers and tweaking things so that we get the fun of creating rather than merely repeating, or using the same situation in a different setting with different genre expectations (a noir detective version or whatever), which I suspect is what you do, too.  So we've got that in common, at least.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100008/#Comment_100008" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-30T12:12:23+00:00" title="September 30, 2007 12:12PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2007 12:13PM by Mike_Sands.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite><br/>....we're going to rewrite<i>history</i>only better?</blockquote>\nNo, that's not what I was getting at in the least.<br/><br/>Even if you don't know much about a particular time and place, it is very easy to go find a lot of information about it.

That includes the villains, hence why I mentioned my problem with Sauron the Necromancer of Dol Goldur. Unlike James, who thinks it's cool to mess with Tolkien's story, I find it abhorent. Now, at one point, we did run across Gandalf... he was a plot device of the GM who stopped by to drop off some Wight-Slaying swords. The GM wanted to use the Barrow-Downs part of the Bree Module, and we wouldn't have survived without these swords (as it was, we killed them pretty easily, and then had massively powerful magic items from the past). <br/>\n<br/>\nIt disturbed me less that Gandalf had done this - it would be a blip in his history that wouldn't change any later act - than the fact that we had just looted the Barrow Downs, leaving nothing for Frodo and gang. I kept thinking like, "Well maybe the Witch-king comes back later, and re-seeds them." But then what about the treasures? I couldn't make it make sense with what I knew about Middle Earth...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's the problem. Why should I play in a place where my knowledge of the place is always getting screwed up. I know about the barrow downs, not because I've read some history of Middle Earth that explains their existence, and how they got corrupted, but through the lens of Frodo's contact with them. We make assumptions about their history based on that information. Now I've got to recall the original history, and the new one we've created, and keep them straight. <br/>\n<br/>\nI only want one Middle Earth. Especially since I can have many other worlds with other histories. <br/>\n<br/>\nJames, yes, not all of the setting is messed up, and, yes, there is still some common language in terms of the creation myth and other events known to have historically happened before that point in the history of Middle Earth. But in a way that was troubling, too, at times. So... Bree does not change at all in 2000 years? Seemed the same Bree to me that we'd see at the time of the War of the Rings. I know that some of the books had notes for the differences of 2000 years past, but I'm not sure what they were, and I certainly didn't get much of a sense of it. The one difference that I was made aware of that I can think of is the existence of Tharbad as a living town of substantial size. But, frankly, though in re-reading the books recently I see that Tolkien mentions Tharbad once, it wasn't such a mention that I would have recalled in play, "Oh, that's the place that'll be a ruin in 2000 years." It could easily have existed just as written in Frodo's time. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe point being that it usually felt like what we were playing was Middle Earth at the time of the war of the rings, minus the war of the rings. Since Tolkien never did detail Middle Earth in the 1600s, every difference there is a guess or vague projection based on some rumor from the books... or sheer invention. Those seemed few, however, as it is clear that the authors of the ICE books were trying desperately to cling on to whatever canon they could uncover (I have complaints about this, too, but that's a separate issue). <br/>\n<br/>\nBut in any case, I completely accept that you had fun with the game. My attempts to explain why I didn't have fun with it are not an attempt to convince you or anybody else that you did not have fun. Since I never claimed that, I think it's interesting that you feel a need to defend the fact that you had fun... but we'll take it at face value. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat still doesn't change the fact that 1600s Middle Earth is not War of the Rings Middle Earth. That is, you didn't play out anything that Tolkien wrote. If, in fact, it's so fun to change the canon by messing around with the known history of Middle Earth, why didn't you play in the much more tumultuous times of the War of the Ring? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do the authors of the ICE products include the 1600s mileau? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's because they playtested the stuff, and somebody had the same problem that I did. I know I'm not the only one that feels this way. Everybody explains that they don't want to replay the events of the source material, or reinvent them. They talk about the three options to avoid this problem:<br/>\n1)Play before the time of the events of the book. Basically the situation of the book is not yet established. <br/>\n2)Play during the time of the events, but in the "underbelly" style, where the characters are smaller than those of the books, and deal with smaller issues. Again we avoid the set-up situation, by creating a smaller situation. <br/>\n3)Play after the time of the events of the book. That situation has played out, and we have to figure out another. <br/>\n<br/>\nOther arguments of the potential benefits of each, they all seek to do the same thing, which is to avoid replaying the same situation that the books play through. They do this, I believe, because we all feel that playing those events in a different way would be of little or no use. <br/>\n<br/>\nYet... to me at least, this is the draw of these books. Yeah, Tolkien has a lot of cool setting stuff, but, as I've said, none of it original. Heck, even the set-up is somewhat stolen from certain Norse sagas, and even Wagner's interpretations of such. The point being that it's all stuff that we can easily reproduce. <br/>\n<br/>\nAccounting FT, your point doesn't contradict mine. I don't have an urge to play Middle Earth because it's hard to create situation, or that situation is harder to create than setting. I want to do it because I like that set-up. But, again, I agree with you that it's not hard to create that same set-up in another setting. Since I don't see setting as hard to create (I mostly use stock published fantasy settings, or just create the setting as I need it in play), and I don't see Situation as hard to create, I gain no benefit at all from using Middle Earth in terms of ease. In fact, if I feel I have a need to remain faithful to the canon, that's actually extra effort I have to put in to avoid errors. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have the same problem with Glorantha, actually. That world has become such a mass of canon and semi-canon, that I prefer to aviod it to avoid the even the urge to try to remain faithful to it. I'd rather that the facts of the world come to us in play as they come to us in books... as surprises. That is, I'm sure that Frodo knows that the Green Dragon Inn is in Bywater, and my ME character would know that, too. But as a reader I get to discover that fact. I like the same feeling as a player. As opposed to the feeling that I know who the Necromancer is, but my character does not. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the common language thing... these are all myths, and we must neccessarily steal. Even Tolkien had to. If I'm playing in another setting and want laser-wielding space-knights, I can just say, "They're a lot like Jedi." In fact I've done just that. I've often explained elves by how they compare or contrast to Tolkien's elves. Just because I'm not using the setting, doesn't mean that I can't reference it, and use tropes from it. <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, what you gain from playing in a book setting is the precise data. Bree is X days ride East of the Shire. But, again to me the draw is not that data, but the idea of a hobbit, a ring, a wizard, and a king. I want a story like that. <br/>\n<br/>\nLike that. Not that story. I want to set up a different world, with somewhat different characters, but who have the potential to play out the same sort of grandios story. Without mucking up the one that I already have from that other setting. <br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100120/#Comment_100120" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T06:05:17+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  6:05AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...from Above. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the subject of history... actually if the game is specifically billed as an "alternate history" game... I don't have much problem with it. And "underbelly" play... like Band of Brothers where you might have some action on a small scale that you can't percieve how it would change history... that's fine, too. But, frankly, I prefer to play in fantasy worlds in part because I don't have to worry about the "Well, if we did this, then this would have changed... etc." A sort of "What if" play is OK from time to time, specifically as such. I might even buy into a game that was specifically "What if Boromir had gotten the ring from Frodo" or such (somebody not long ago proposed something similar). But only as a short, specific exercise with that goal. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat sort of thing is not why I usually play. And this, I think, is the crux of all of this. When I play, it is to create our own myths. I'm not a "story-gamer," I'm a "Myth-gamer." The difference being that I'm far, far less concerned at all with "plot" than I am with characters making decisions that have meanings that resonate with we the players. Whether or not they have some "narrative arc" or any of that (my games resemble soap operas more than novels or episodic TV shows). <br/>\n<br/>\nAs such, I've found that playing in a setting that exists without mythic baggage is important to this. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, at this point, I'm willing to concede defeat... you all say you're different, and that you're not so affected as I am, or at least not so deeply. That you get benefits from playing in these settings that outweigh any negatives. Fine, I'm an aberrant mutant (that's feigned passive-agressiveness there, mind you; I still think I'm right). At least I've had a chance to put my perspective out there. Thanks for that opportunity. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if y'all are really so into this, then back to the thread as it was concieved... What games do you play which settings with? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100129/#Comment_100129" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T07:20:25+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  7:20AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2007 7:21AM by JDCorley.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gotham City -&gt; Advemture!<br/>Rubicon Beach -&gt; Trinity<br/>Forgotten Realms -&gt; D&amp;D3<br/>Thief: The Dark Project -&gt; GURPS, then MURPG for a Keepers game<br/>Buffy -&gt; Buffy (and also PTA)<br/>Star Wars -&gt; Star Wars d6 and d20 and PTA<br/><br/>Everything I did in Changeling was informed by Little, Big...but that's probably the most tenuous connection that I would still call an adaptation.<br/><br/>I'm not much of a myth guy.

Of course you can't just stat up all the main characters from the book and run them through the exact same story as written. That's called reading, not playing.

I mean there is still value in all modes of play that reflects a setting:<br/>- mode 1: play in a general setting changing facts and even major events but still reflecting the moods and themes of play.<br/>- mode 2: play out the scenes and conflicts in an established storyline to see how your play group would have handled things.  Maybe the game would be similar and rock because you SO SEE why <i>X</i> character did <i>Y</i>.  Or you could alter the storyline and have fun within the general parameters of the setting and NPCs.  There are plenty of stories I read that I like but I think a detail or a certain conversation would have been cooler than the way the author did it.<br/>- mode 3: play around the events in question with the players experiencing the fictions events second hand and their implications.<br/><br/>2) To think that <i>just because someone "did it" somehow means your group can't do it better </i>seems overly limiting.  There a LOT of movie and books that I go "<i>it would have been so much better if they went this way.</i>"<br/><br/>3)  SO what I am hearing from Mike is "you can't have fun in a book/movie setting and play THAT story exactly."  Am I right?  If so, isn't that kinda a strawman?  I wouldn't even consider it.  The point of playing in a setting is to act under similar situations and scenes being framed with a common backdrop.  I don't need to fast-forward 1000 years to make that fun.  Someone mentioned the "what ifs."  That's fantastic stuff.  Sure there is a war between the Atredies and the Harkonon on this dustball.  But what aweseom stuff is happening on the other side of the universe?  What plans are the Benejeserit hatching to solidify their power on some critical mining world.  What are the Harkonon trying to do to blackmail the Guild in case their plans on Arakis fails?  That stuff isn't less significant.  It's just not mentioned in the source fiction.  What's going on in other cities in EQUILIBRIUM?  What would a detective in NY experience in the Fifth Element universe.  No one actually knows what dangers they faced in the movies but the setting itself is compelling to play characters in.  I have a hard time establishing why these ideas are somehow devalued?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100525/#Comment_100525" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T13:30:08+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  1:30PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actual Play example, and you can read the entirety of the Actual Play <a href="http://www.skyseastone.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Phases/PreviousPhases" rel="nofollow">here</a> because it's a Wiki game. <br/><br/>An Amber Wiki game. Not just "in the Amberverse", at least to start out with, but, in the first three phases, actually set in the interstices of the Amber first-series canon. <br/><br/>For me, that was a big plus. We're playing the inhabitants of Tir na Nog'th, the City in the Sky, and the second and third phases include the visits made to Tir by Corwin and Benedict in the books. I can't tell you how much fun I had playing it in such a way that the decisions we made and the actions we took naturally and logically led to the canon events, which are never really explained in the books. Why does Dara appear on the throne in Corwin's vision? How is it that the same scene is re-enacted in the throne room in Amber later? It's all because the inhabitants of Tir, and my character in particular, wanted to mess with Corwin's head (and can see a short way into the future).<br/><br/>Now we've split off from canon and are playing "alternate Amber", which is a different kind of fun. The point I'm making, though, is that <i>for me</i>, playing out events that fitted into canon was also a hell of a lot of fun, because the creative constraints made it challenging.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100526/#Comment_100526" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T13:33:39+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  1:33PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like I'm a broken record. I don't think that I've managed to communicate the problem to even one person yet. I'll try one more time (and hope it doesn't derail the thread):<br/>\n<br/>\n1. When I am attracted to "play a book," what attracts me is the sort of situation that is played out in the book. <br/>\n2. If, in fact, the book didn't do a good job, then why would I be interested in playing out that situation? Obviously it's not a good one. And, like the man said above, it's just as easy to come up with a new one. I'm only attracted to playing books with good situations. <br/>\n3. But we never actually get to play those situations. Because we avoid them like the plague. Why? I don't know, but we do. My speculation is that it has to do with not feeling that it would be fun to play out the same situation, because it would be too tempting to play out the same themes. Or that, even if we don't play out the same themes, then we're losing that situation again. In which case we're back to being as well off having created the situation from scratch. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no strawman here, I'm talking about how I feel when I play in published worlds that I've read, or seen in movies. In fact, at this point you all have me wanting to just admit that I'm neurotic in some way, and just give up on this thread, because from your perspectives I seem to be some sort of freak... and at this point, I'm just trying to convince you all that I'm not insane. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo be clear, I think that there's a phenomenon here that people are either not seeing or ignoring, but apparently all I have to fall back on is my own annecdotal evidence about how I feel. But let me be clear about that. Given the choice between running a game in a published world, or running a game in world of my own devising, or a published world for a game, I'll avoid the published world just about every time. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's a fact, not speculation. Feel free to assign me whatever motive you like for feeling this way. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100528/#Comment_100528" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T13:40:02+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  1:40PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, Mike, accepted - that's your preference, no problemo.<br/><br/>And because you have the thing of "I love this situation because it was done so well, but I don't want to game it because it was done so well", you'd rather come up with your own situations as well as your own settings.

I've futzed around with using settings from books before, and either used the book setting superficially (the map, perhaps with some additional detail put in their by an RPG publisher and perhaps some NPCs). My original reason for not doing this was realizing the universe D&amp;D; described was nothing like that in any books I had read, but I think I also at some level understood the problems with trying to play a book but not the story in the book (which realization also I believe kept me away from illusionist "story" play).<br/>\n<br/>\nI even agree with your point about Glorantha. I've had fun games in Glorantha, but they were primarily derrived from RuneQuest plus Cults of Prax, with bits borrowed from other supplements (Snake Pipe Hollow and Apple Lane were fun, I used the map from Trollpak, I've used other bits from published material). My more recent campaign was a failure, in part because of the saturation of additional material. I'll probably still do RQ/Glorantha again sometime in the future, but I'll make it clear that the only canon is RQ+Cults of Prax+Cults of Terror. Obviously I'll borrow stuff from the other publications, but only to the extent that they are useful for the campaign in play, and no different from the way I have borrowed D&amp;D; modules for RQ/Glorantha play. Heck, I think my successfull play even downplayed the Lunar occupation.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100569/#Comment_100569" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T16:33:20+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  4:33PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, I've had it for a while now (I think), it's a little like trying to puzzle out an alien transmission, we're so far apart, but I think I got it. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/><br><br>Actually, my Gotham City game may have been something like what you are aiming at in your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.

I've been reading over this discussion, and decided I'd like to chime in. Unfortunately, I discovered I had to wait to get "authenticated", so my comments are a little out of synch--almost to the point of irrelevance or obsolescence. Hopefully, that's cool with everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, as far as gaming in the realms of our favourite novel or film, is concerned...<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, I agree with Mike Holmes on most points. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe setup in most stories exists to tell THAT particular story. Characters like Darth Vader and Luke were created from the get-go to tell the whole "fall and redemption" thing. Once the situation is resolved, well, it's done. If you want to tell that story again, you need someone other than Darth and Luke, and you're going to have to pretty much create all that from scratch.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for retelling or participating in those narratives, part of what makes great stories truly mythical and/or memorable is that we get the feeling that _things could not have gone any other way_. <br/>\n<br/>\nThese factors put together mean that most existing fiction is not good fodder for roleplaying.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, there are problems you need to deal with that don't come up in "blank slate" roleplaying or story creation. When you're dealing with material everyone is emotionally attached to, there's a lot more room for error, for anger, and for disappointment. In a "blank slate" game, you can say, "Hey, Bob, wouldn't the Red Sorcerers be a better foil for your character if they were from Egypt instead of France?" And thereby you can solve a major problem, whether in the fiction, or between the players.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a "canon setting", on the other hand, this is usually impossible. In addition, there is the dangerous illusion created by choosing such a setting: the players feel that have all agreed on something by claiming that setting, whereas in reality their conceptions of that setting may vary and clash wildly. If this leads people to handle the material less carefully or less thoughtfully than they normally would ("Would bringing in the Ring help Jane<br/>\naddress her Issue?"), you have another potential disaster.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I saw the issue in Lord of the Rings as a loyalty thing, whereas you saw it as a World War II allegory, and Bob thought it was a Christian allegory.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, I think working from a "canon setting" is more dangerous or misleading than it is useful--i.e. it will generally take MORE WORK rather than less to pull it off successfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, there are a couple of interesting ways your favorite setting can enhance your game, and I think it might be interesting to look at them. (Many have been mentioned already.) Here's my contribution:<br/>\n<br/>\n--Using a familiar setting can serve as a shortcut to fleshing out a situation or setting. For defining setting: if everyone knows what kind of food will be served in a particular culture, there's no need to describe it. Likewise for situation--if there is a Harkonnen and an Atreides in your relationship map, you don't need to dig deep to find a reason for them to dislike each other. It's sort of a shortcut to setting up and justifying a dynamic situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n--You can take advantage of players' emotional connections to the material to heighten the drama of the story. Telling an Elf character that the Orc he just killed has features that look uncannily like the portrait of his grandfather has instant emotional meaning and impact. There's no need to establish background facts to make that sort of statement possible. If the Elf decides to "go into the West", everyone can draw on some of the melancholy feelings they experienced while reading LoTR. If Galadriel sacrifices Lothlorien to an Orcish army in orderto stop some greater evil, everyone at the table knows how big a deal that is. You don't need to build up to it as much.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, everyone takes different things from their fiction. As an Actual Play example, I have a group of friends who have been playing out a long, long Star Wars campaign. They might get angry if they heard me say this, but I don't think their game has _anything whatsoever_ to do with Star Wars, not in terms of themes, or myths, or archetypes...<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, there's not a single Jedi in the game. But they have a great time, dealing with crime, politics, economics, and plain old adventure, all while staying away from the Star Wars story itself. However, I do not think it is a "waste" for them to be using the Star Wars setting in that way. Why not? It's a pure celebration of colour. Their characters may not be archetypal heroes dealing with themes of good, evil, and redemption. They may be more of a film noit detective/hardened mercenary/traveling circus freak. But when they shoot each other they do it with _blasters_, and afterwards they blast off into _hyperspace_. The players even put on the Star Wars soundtrack while they're playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, this works for them. I could get into it as well (and have), but only if I seriously lowered my expectations first. I have to remember I won't see any evil Emperors or attempts to corrupt the good and powerful or save the universe. Then I can play with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I want to suggest an alternative, or twist, on the "underbelly" model. More precisely, how can one play an "underbelly"-type situation while still making the story about the characters, and possibly about the major themes of that story. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe twist is that you set up the situation in the "underbelly" style, with minor characters unmentioned in the canon, but you set up the situation so that those characters are in fact revealed to be responsible for the major event of the book or film.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, consider a story that takes place on the Titanic... and reveals that the main characters, unknown to history, were actually responsible for its demise. Or perhaps in Star Wars: A New Hope, there was a plan by Darth Vader to somehow protect the Death Star's "weak spot", anticipating the rebels' tactics. But a group of unsung heroes,<br/>\nperhaps prisoners or sympathizers aboard the Death Star are working to make sure that countermeasure does not get installed in time for the rebel attack...<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a thematic equivalent to this--perhaps the outcome is not so much at stake, but the story can be retold to highlight a different theme, or to reveal a different answer. There are few examples of this, but "Ender's Shadow" by Orson Scott Card is a very interesting attempt. (Any of have any thoughts on what makes that book work... or fail?)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, my question: how can one use this approach without running into railroad/classic "Impossible Thing" territory? Are there systems that can pull thisoff? (I use the word "system" loosely here--either a published set of rules, or<br/>\nperhaps just a different approach you can take with your group.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking forward to hearing more of your thoughts,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul T.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100674/#Comment_100674" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T07:07:56+00:00" title="October  3, 2007  7:07AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apparently I'm not crazy. Or, if I am, there are several people who share my malady. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's comforting, either way. <br/>\n<br/>\nJD, thanks for thinking that the phenomenon is "neat" but, for me, it sucks. I mean it's like when I look at a big slab of liver in the meat case. It looks oh so good, and, look, it's on special for a price I can afford. If that were steak, I'd be in heaven. But it's not, and I've had liver before, and I know I'd hate it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for your ideas, I think that they're all valid ones, and ones I'd enjoy. I can deal with a character that's very similar to another, just with the serial numbers filed off, in a different setting. In fact, I think that's what the vast majority of new characters are, whether in novels, movies, or in RPGs. And that's what I'm advocating as the "safe" thing to do... play something else, neccessarily employing the tropes we're all familiar with. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not saying we can't steal. In fact, I do little else. Consider that my long running HQ game, both in FTF and IRC incarnations, is run using ICE's old Shadow World setting. This setting was developed from leftover setting information that the ICE crew had from developing the Middle Earth setting. To be very precise, I believe that the islands from the Iron Wind module are the same ones that are in the ICE extended map of Middle Earth in the bay in the north central region. They lost the license, but had this information copyrighted. So they just decided to plunk it down on another map. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom that, the Shadow World setting emerges. It's neccessarily derivative of Tolkien, what with it's three types of elves that match Tolkien's three families, and it's orc cognates (lugroki use precisely the same stats as orcs). It also emulates D&amp;D, perhaps unsurprisingly. <br/>\n<br/>\nDerivative though it may be, it's far enough removed from Middle Earth that I have no qualms whatsoever about playing in it. In fact, being removed from Middle Earth, it, of course, has it's own quirks. Like a history of high technology, and more technology than one ever sees in Middle Earth (it's interesting about how much is implied with Saruman, of course, he being allegorical for modernization and pollution, etc). And instead of one dark lord, there is a whole ring of them!<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah it's somewhat lasersharked, but that's another issue. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, again as I've said above, I'm not even so much against playing the game as a distinct "what if?" "What if Boromir gets the ring?" Fine, let's do that as an experiment and see where it leads. Using FASERIP Marvel, I used to do "What if the Thing fought Spiderman?" experiments all the time. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat bugs me is the generalized notion that such games seem to tend to begin with a notion of "Let's just make up characters, and put them in Middle Earth, and I'm sure we'll get Tolkien-esque adventure." Because that's the promise that I've never seen delivered upon.  What's interesting is that I'm sure I could get it if I played in the Midnight setting (using a system like HQ). I just can't get Tolkien-esque in Middle Earth, ironically enough. <br/>\n<br/>\nPaul makes some excellent additional points. I also feel like it's more work than it's worth. If I'm playing in Middle Earth, it's to do an homage, and to honor the canon, and I'm going to be feeling like I have to stick to that canon - else why use such a setting, again? If I have to stick to the canon, I have to look things up, or have it all memorized...<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, you don't have to do this, but then I'm not attracted to using Middle Earth. And the slight feeling I get that I'm messing up a masterpiece sneaks in and makes it not at all worthwhile. <br/>\n<br/>\nNo disrespect to Terry Amthor (designer of Shadow World), but his setting isn't a literary masterpiece. He shouldn't be insulted, however, he didn't make his world to be thematically complete, it's a compliment to him that the world seems attractive to play in, demanding that the players thematically complete it. And that's despite his best attempts to ruin in by the inclusion of a rather detailed metaplot (including, I should add, fiction that he writes about the setting; I try not to read it, and I wish he'd stop writing it). <br/>\n<br/>\nThink of it this way... let's say you came to a game, and you were handed a character, and then told that the character had been played for five years in that game, and that he had this glorious history that had ended with him becoming king. Looking at the sheet, it screams "And he lived happily ever after." Would you want to play that character, or make up a new one, one of your own with thematic potential that you created him with, his story untold? Well, I, for one, would prefer a new character to play, please. <br/>\n<br/>\nSettings are just very complex characters, from my POV. Their story either stands ready to be played out, or it already has been. I'd prefer the fresh setting, the one that I haven't seen the end of.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that this fits well into my theory of why it's so dread dull to hear about another player's PC. "And then we went and slew Loki, because he was threatening to overrun the world with evil." I understand why people want to relate these events... to them they are of great mythic significance. But it's the relation of the events in the crucible of play that makes them significant. If I was not there for that creation, the events mean nothing to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nTabula Rasa. I want a clean slate. This is why I've developed the pure "other world" method of play, where the setting is created during play, and only during play. I'm not against having references, but I find that we all already do have references that we can rely upon. We have Middle Earth in common, so when I say, "A hulking Troll walks into the room" I really don't have to describe it much. <br/>\n<br/>\nGreg Stafford has developed a saying, "Your Glorantha Will Vary" or YGWV. It was, "Your Glorantha May Vary" YGMV, but he found that wasn't potent enough. The notion he's trying to get across is that in playing in Glorantha (be it with HQ or RQ or whatever system), you neccessarily alter it from his vision of Glorantha. He's saying that, not only is it permissible, but, in fact, it's unavoidable. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with the phrase is that it's largely used with the subtext, "I can't modify Glorantha to fit your vision, so any answer I give to your question pertains only to Glorantha as I see it, and you'll have to modify the answer to fit any alterations that you've made to Glorantha in play." At a certain point it becomes more burdensome to pay any attention to what Glorantha is like, than it is to just make up your own answer every time. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn which case, why bother Greg for an answer? That is, this is the point at which I decide that I'm not going to use Glorantha, because I can avoid the temptation to ask Greg for a solution by having a setting in which only I know any of the answers. <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, people think I'm crazy for this, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's put this perspective on it... RPGs are a creative activity. Is it so crazy to want to make up my own worlds and play in them? Instead of playing in worn out ones? When we all agree that the creative act of making up the world is, itself, fun? I'm not saying that playing in Middle Earth isn't creative, there's still the question of the particular story created. I'm just saying that I'd prefer not to be constrained by the urge to conform to a pre-existing setting. And to the extent that I do not cherish a setting, it's easier to resist that urge. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. continuing apollogies for the thread derailure.

Has it ever been that prevalent? Maybe in Buffy and Angel...maybe in d20 Star Wars...hmmm...maybe it is prevalent. I cut my teeth on setting-adaptation gaming with Star Wars d6 which was very clear: you are fast-talking Rebel operatives. You will go on missions. They will go awry and you will have adventures while romancing hot girls or guys or aliens and firing a blaster whilst leaping through the air. I took from that a clear picture of situation-building that I have applied to adaptations from then on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100859/#Comment_100859" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T13:39:44+00:00" title="October  3, 2007  1:39PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, to re-rail the thread with a clearer understanding, thanks to OtherMike, of what books may be giving us: <br/><br/>If you have a favourite book that gives you a particular kind of story, a particular kind of experience, a particular kind of situation, a particular set of themes, even, and that makes you want a game "like that" - what is it about that book that you love and want to see in a game, and what would the system for that game need to do/support/encourage/require in order to deliver what you're looking for?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4407/books-and-the-systems-that-game-them" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4407/books-and-the-systems-that-game-them" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4407/books-and-the-systems-that-game-them/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F4407%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F4407%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
