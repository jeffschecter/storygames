<div class="Message">
                    Based on Matt Snyder's "You are Not Your Games" thread, and my recent thread about "Outing."<br/>
<br/>
If I'm understanding Matt correctly, he's expressing annoyance that there's a perceived link between gamers, and broader geek sub-culture.  Obviously these two groups aren't <i>necessarily</i> connected, but in practice they often are.  And this can complicate the lives of folks who like gaming, but who don't strongly identify with the geek sub-culture.  (Matt, I trust you'll correct me if I've misread you; I'll edit this post accordingly, or if necessary delete the discussion.)<br/>
<br/>
So: assuming that a hypothetical person might want to get the geek out of gaming, how would that work?<br/>
<br/>
(To save everyone some time, there have been about six kajillion threads on RPGNet about this, and the frequent recommendations are:<br/>
* Don't feel like a geek, and you won't be one<br/>
* Create games that are all about casual gaming<br/>
* Create games with much simpler rules<br/>
* Create games that are less laser-sharky<br/>
* Things are fine as they are, we don't want the Norms stinking it up<br/>
* Etc. )                </div>

                            I think we need to make a distinction here that isn't always made---making RPGs "less geeky" isn't the same thing as making them more attractive to the <i>casual gamer</i>. What I mean is, the casual gamer wants to play right away without commitment. Making games simpler &amp; shorter would appeal to this type of person. But there are many non-geeky activities that require training, practice, and commitment; music for example.<br><br>Making RPGs less geeky would mostly involve changing the content of the games. This would involve certain manifestation in the rules, of course. It would involve selecting non-geeky subjects like contemporary drama, crime thrillers, action movie, um, stuff, romance, comedy, etc. It would involve removing fetishized content and forces, like kitchen-sinking genres as well as fetishizing mechanics like pages and pages of skills... um, I would have to think about what else.                        </br></br></div>

                            James, this is the question that I always want to ask these threads, because I think the answer to this question says a lot about why the topic is asked over and over and over again.  The question is: <em>why?</em>  It's not rhetorical, I know there are a handful of perfectly valid answers to it.  I'm just curious which one is motivating you right now.                        </div>

I disagree here.  I think the lack of casual RPG-play is as much a factor as content when it comes to geek status.<br><br>Cribbing from my post in another thread:<br><br><i>Star Wars </i>itself is enjoyed by geeks and non-geeks alike.  Numbers-wise, significantly more non-geeks have watched and enjoyed <i>Star Wars </i>than geeks have.  Liking <i>Star Wars </i>isn't geeky, but being really into <i>Star Wars </i>(so much so that your life revolves around it) is.<br/><br/>A big part of the "geek nature" of RPGing is that there isn't a general sense that gaming is something you can be part of casually.  There's more of a sense that playing RPGs is a kind of lifestyle choice.  I.e., if you play RPGs then you must be as obsessed as the most fanatical <i>Star Wars</i> fan.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            What's motivating this thread, in particular?  Because Matt Snyder came into <i>my</i> thread saying how no one understands him!  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  And it sounds like this is what he wants to talk about, and I'm interested in talking about it too.<br/>
<br/>
What's motivating me is, I'm someone who enjoys gaming, but I feel shy about talking about it.  I got the impression growing up that gaming was a loser activity, and I think that negative impression still exists, more or less.  I've got a healthy self-image, but who wants to have to correct misperceptions all the time?  It's a drag.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that gaming is seen as ridiculous, in large part because it's so geeky (at least as it presently exists).  If I'm wrong about that, the conversation's moot.                        </div>

                            Echoing shreyas, prep must die. The game needs to be playable out of the box with the bare minimum of setup.<br>
<br>
Also, an ending, within a reasonably short time of having begun the thing from scratch. Say two hours, tops. I can entice people to play a two hour baoard-game, but as the time needed to be invested gets olonger it becomes increasingly more difficult (and closer to a "hobby" than a "game", as it were).<br>
<br>
The thing, is, I reckon there's actually a lot of quasi-roleplaying out there, where people play baord games and the like and, to a certain extent, maybe even unconsciously, get into character while doing it. A de-geeked RPG might look a bit like that.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

And this is in large part a resources thing - RPGin, especially trad. RPGing, takes a lot of resources, in terms of time, money, organisation and effort, to achieve.<br/>

<p>Well, honestly, I want to bring a game to the table that isn't crufty, that I feel is mechanically strong and descriptively engaging. It also has to be something that is <em>physically attractive</em> and doesn't have that sort of messy middle-school homework look many games do. It has to be prep-free, something I can just pull out of the closet and start playing.</p>
<p>It has to compete with Apples to Apples.</p>
<p>(AtA is sort of my benchmark for games that are appealing to people who are looking for some fun but aren't even casual gamers.) Thus far, I don't know of any such game.</p>

The closest I've seen is the mini-Larp, Trick or Treat, and similar ones. They strike me as more similar to a party game like Charades than what i usually think of a LARP being:<br/><a href="http://www.interactivitiesink.com/minigames/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.interactivitiesink.com/minigames/index.html</a><br/><br/>I'm not sure what broader lessons can be learned from it, though.                        </div>

Okay, I think this may be hitting my "not really an issue" button because I'm designing something like this, and in my head, it's already done and working, so what the hell is everyone complaining about? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Shreyas, tell me if this fits the bill: one book, using playing cards (rummy) instead of polyhedral dice, with characters who are historical figures with strong cultural familiarity, gives each player has a one-page sheet that describes their character in short, starts with a prep-free situation creation mechanic, total play time of two to three hours.  Am I on target?  Would that compete with Apples to Apples in your game closet?                        </div>

                            James,<br/>
I am more in your camp<br/>
yes I have had people call me a satanist for being a gamer (and for being a Pagan not sure which label gets me more flack)<br/>
I am cautious in who i reveal I game with. Alwasy have, always will. Just a part and parcel of my nature anymore. A variety of factors going into that, personal, professional, societal, habitual. Suffice to say i tend to be very private, and my hobby is behind the privacy fence.<br/>
<br/>
With that said, i think for me at the beginning was all the negative press gaming got (with those first few suicides back in the day) and so I just held it close to the vest. Had a good 10 some gaming friends in HS so nice large group. We have kept in touch more or less. I found a few fellow gamers when I was in the military (pagans and theatre folk also so more common grounds between us) as well as finding some really good FLGSs over the years.<br/>
<br/>
I think with the rise of more prominent people such as actors (Wil Wheaton, Vin Diesel) stating they are gamers it can only lead to good. Now if we could get a Senator who games and admits it we could be all set. Still likely fringe, but closer to a more 'mainstream' notice.                        </div>

                            Here's a few design ideas that I've thought about:

<li>Add a board or some physical representation of the imagined space. "What kind of game is it?" "Oh, it's a little like a board game?"</li>
<li>Lose the term "role-playing." It's a story game.</li>
<li>Somehow reduce or remove a central power figure or no GM.</li>
<li>Include more items to spark creative imaginings or you don't have to make stuff up and play pretend.</li>

Holy moly.  You, sir, are a genius.  I hope whichever masked superheroes create the Iron Gaming Chef competition spot this!  Because it would be really interesting to see an Iron Game Chef dealie where the design is serving a purpose, rather than just design-for-design's sake.                        </div>

This goes back to my "fetishizing" comment. Commitment isn't a bad thing. Alot of activities (golf, computers, skiing, etc.) require money and time.

I generally agree with these for a pick-up and play game -- certainly the first three and the last one.  <br/><br/>Oh, and a big one:  Shorter playing time, and no expectation of multiple session play.  <br/><br/>This goes with the last point -- one of the things which most RPGs (including indie ones) are weak on is introductory scenarios.  These are vital for a pick-up and play game.  Even if there isn't a GM and the players can create story on the fly, asking the players to invent characters and a plot out of whole cloth is offputting to most people.  <br/><br/>Also, whatever the physical components are, they need to be easy to roll out and take back.  D&amp;D has some nice components, for example, but a battlemat is a real pain to roll out and draw on.  There's been some products to lay out as tiles instead, I think, which would be a definite improvement.  <br/><br/>I think the <i>why</i> question is important, since it changes a lot of what you'll look for.  For example, if I want a game to play with my non-geeky friends, removing the GM isn't necessarily going to help.  At least, there's a place to have a knowledgeable moderator or central figure, since I'll be playing.  If I want a game I can give to my non-geeky teenage cousin to play, then removing the GM may help.  <br/><br/>As a small plug:  Last week, some gamer friends showed up at my place, but the GM for the game we had been planning to play cancelled at the last minute.  I literally took <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dead of Night</span> out of my jacket pocket, to use.  I printed out and handed them sheets, and read them the intro to one of the scenarios.  We played it out in around 2 hours.                        </div>

This gets back to the "why" question.  If you want a game which you can pick up and play casually with your non-geeky family or friends, then I think that single-session play is vital -- certainly removing the <i>expectation</i> of multi-session play.  That doesn't mean that it is better in general -- just that it is a different purpose.  <br/><br/>In general, I prefer campaign play, but then again, I'm proud of my geekiness and play with my cool geeky friends.                        </div>

                            To highlight something: I don't think that the long term play aspect is inherently geeky, or no more so than any other trope. It is only geeky when it is fetishized. (Just like most of the other tropes.) <br/><br/>"I'll play for three years because it gives me consistent fun for three years" is something that lots of non geeks can understand. <br/><br/>"I'll play for three years because that's the only way to have real fun" isn't. <br/><br/>Which may tie into the "You can play for three years" is cool where the "you must play for three years" isn't. <br/><br/>I think its interesting that while Mo and I played a historical Ireland game with her mother, Mo had never seriously suggested playing any RPG with her lawyer sister - until Crime &amp; Punishment. Now she's actually trying to get her sister to play, and her sister is actually showing the odd sign of interest. Part of that is because C&amp;P is a oneshot, and her sister is a casual gamer. A different part of it is that C&amp;P isn't about a geek trope, and is about something that her sister is interested in. OTOH, when I told my (very non-gamer) aunt about the game her first question was "does it have to be a one game thing, or could you make a whole season up?"                        </div>

How about one that works every single time you play it out of the box. How many pre-made scenarios does monopoly have? And how different is every game? Poker?<br/><br/>Replayability is a <b>very<i></i></b> big deal, and it seems like what you're getting at here. I see a bit of  clash between the <i>ideal</i> (not necessarily reality) of replayability and the idea of pre-made scenarios.
<blockquote><blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Can and should a product have a seperate book about making your own scenarios and characters?</blockquote>

If I ask a question back are we at questions-cubed? Here's mine: If I built a game that didn't cover some very basic/common stuff ( Chargen+ scenario building), would players create their own regardless?<br/><br/>It seems to me that a certain percentage would, no matter what. I'm thinking that that behavior points to different ways to present, market, and sell games.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bryan</cite>Are character sheets a "fetish" to avoid?</blockquote>
Bad, stupid, non-functional character sheets are a fetish to avoid.  Character sheets that needlessly list irrelevant stuff (eye color) and leave off important stuff (motivations) and character sheets that present information in poor ways (Nobilis has you to check off which code of beliefs you ascribe to) need to be jettisoned out the window.  The assumption that players will know what a character sheet is for needs to go.<br/><br/>However, well-designed and functional character sheets are good things.  I like to think of these as character playmats to reinforce the interactive, tactile use that I'm getting at.  In fact I suspect that character playmats could handily replace the board in new-to-roleplaying folks, and lend them an air of familiarity and comfort.                        </div>

                            Heya,
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite><cite>Posted By: Bryan</cite>Here's a few design ideas that I've thought about:<br/><br/>No prep.<br/>Easy to learn the basics or it doesn't take twenty minutes trying to explain how to play.<br/>Add a board or some physical representation of the imagined space. "What kind of game is it?" "Oh, it's a little like a board game?"<br/>Lose the term "role-playing." It's a story game.<br/>Somehow reduce or remove a central power figure or no GM.<br/>Include more items to spark creative imaginings or you don't have to make stuff up and play pretend.<br/></blockquote>
I generally agree with these for a pick-up and play game -- certainly the first three and the last one.<br/><br/>Oh, and a big one: Shorter playing time, and no expectation of multiple session play.<br/><br/>This goes with the last point -- one of the things which most RPGs (including indie ones) are weak on is introductory scenarios. These are vital for a pick-up and play game. Even if there isn't a GM and the players can create story on the fly, asking the players to invent characters and a plot out of whole cloth is offputting to most people.<br/><br/>Also, whatever the physical components are, they need to be easy to roll out and take back. D&amp;D has some nice components, for example, but a battlemat is a real pain to roll out and draw on. There's been some products to lay out as tiles instead, I think, which would be a definite improvement.<br/><br/>I think the<i>why</i>question is important, since it changes a lot of what you'll look for. For example, if I want a game to play with my non-geeky friends, removing the GM isn't necessarily going to help. At least, there's a place to have a knowledgeable moderator or central figure, since I'll be playing. If I want a game I can give to my non-geeky teenage cousin to play, then removing the GM may help.<br/><br/><br/>-Heh, you guys are discribing every single game coming out in this year's DL-Quarterly.  I say this not to pimp myself (I hate that) but to let you know, that people have taken notice and are trying to do something about it.  I'd throw in Contenders (also a Ronny winner) as another game that does most, if not all of these things.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

                            Regarding the pre-gen/non-pre-gen dealie: my approach would be, include pre-gens.  But also explain how you did them, methodically, so that someone else could rederive it.  If it takes more than 10 minutes to make a pre-gen, it's probably not a gateway game.<br/><br/>Same goes for pre-made scenario's, at least IMO.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>I like to think of these as character playmats to reinforce the interactive, tactile use that I'm getting at.

Like a scrabble letter holder. I like that. I'm not sure that it would completely replace a board, because a board orientates a player to their status and situation in a game. Maybe an additional playmat that is shared in the center that players can move stuff from their playmat to the center playmat.<br/><br/>Anyway, love the idea.                        </div>

                            Honestly, it seems like we have these discussions all the time. Most indie games fans, I feel, have a very good idea of what it's going to take to make more "casual games" or "games that are less geek-tastic."  But very few of these actually get produced.  It may be that we just need to keep reminding ourselves of these design principles over and over, so they become more natural and ingrained.<br/><br/>Or it may be that we, ourselves, have to desire these games enough to create them.  Which means not saying "it's too bad these games don't exist" and then going back to happily play and design geek-tastic games and nothing else.<br/><br/>Or maybe we just need a contest to get us off our sorry asses and working on this kind of project.                        </div>

                            I don't know, Jonathan - it seems to me that games along these lines <i>are</i> being designed and published - Contenders, Best Friends, It Was a Mutual Decision, carry, Breaking the Ice, Shoot the Moon, 1001 Nights, etc.<br/><br/>I'm not sure, but the issue right now might not be "how do we design this kind of game" but rather "how can we market this kind of game."<br/><br/>But a contest would be cool, too.                        </div>

<p>I'm really behind the idea of a contest for 'de-geeking' gaming.  But I don't think the ideal contest would be a design contest.  I'm seeing a real-world contest.  A head hunting thing.  See how many non-gamers you can game with in X amount of time.  And how many of those really get into it, even if just for that night.</p>
<p>I'd wager that I could get at least 3 non-gamer, non-geek folks to play a game with me in 2007.  How about you?</p>

                            Jon, I would agree that there is certainly some movement in that direction.  But all the games you mentioned are still clearly rooted in existing roleplaying traditions and are not necessairly things you can pick up and run "right out of the box."  We are getting closer, though.<br/><br/>Eric, that sounds like an evangelism contest.  I was talking with Jukka recently about how roleplaying is always "dying" and the solution is always "get more non-roleplayers to drink the Kool-Aid."  I think we really need to figure out why we want to introduce people to roleplaying.  The "One of Us!" thing isn't so cool.  Do we really want to play with them?  Do they really want to play with us?  If so, cool.                        </div>

                            Agreed. I'm happy with the folks I'm playing with and if one moves away or no longer wants to game, I'm confident I can find someone new whenever I want. "The industry" is not my responsibility and can, in my view, go hang.                        </div>

Yes - I'd agree with that: my point was more that I don't think it is lack of desire or laziness on the part of story-games designers that is responsible for the absence of these kinds of "casual" games.  It seems to me that this is a goal that a lot of people are working towards already.                        </div>

I totally want to play with more new people.  Not everyone, by any stretch.  But some, you bet.<br/><br/>What I want are tools that let me teach gaming, and game with, specific people that might enjoy the *activity* but don't enjoy most of the current trappings or context.                        </div>

                            Jon, I guess I just feel like, if you really wanted to design a casual game, you could.  Sure, it might take more work to keep geek-tastic tendencies from sneaking in, but there's nothing preventing such a game from being designed right now. Stepping stones and shifts in a general direction are cool, but eventually we may need to just bite the bullet and make some casual games.<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> Eric, I'm not really talking about marketing things for non-traditional audiences.  That often ends in wasted time, energy, and money.  I'm more of the "if you build it, they will come" philosophy.                        </div>

                            Well, this might just be a difference in perspective, but...<br/><br/>Most of the stuff that's in this thread was already discussed a few years ago on the Forge (in those Infamous Five threads): look at the difference between the crop of games that were coming out then and the ones I brought up.  I think you're probably right that these design principles need to be revisited, but I think that that's what <i>has</i> been happening over the last few years and that it has had a real effect.  (Maybe I see it less as having to bite the bullet and more as finally being able to reach the other side thanks to all those stepping stones).                        </div>

<p>So, you figure if the magic bullet of mainstream RPGs were built, then the masses would just suddenly convert into gamers?  Without making any efforts to get it to their table?  That's some silly shit.</p>

                            I've played Once Upon a Time with lots and lots of non-geeky people.  Is this experience unique?  Am I the only one?<br/><br/>It's replayable multiple times in a single night.  It hasn't got ugly dice or a grade-school homework character sheet.  It uses tropes that most everyone understands.  You can teach the rules in five minutes and there's no prep time outside the session.<br/><br/>I think OUAP is an awesome template for other kinds of low-impact non-geeky story games.                        </div>

                            Jon, true enough.  It's a lot easier to think about designing casual games now that a bunch of awesome people have given us new tools to use.<br/><br/>Eric, the success of stuff like Apples To Apples or Settlers Of Catan or, say, the instant popularity of Jungle Speed is certainly due to individuals bringing the games to the attention of their friends, especially friends who wouldn't normally be into card games or board games or... whatever you call Jungle Speed.  But it also involves having a game that also has that kind of instinctive appeal and works as a casual game.  Those games make people want to mention them to their friends ("We played this game X last night and it was awesome!"). Right now, I don't really know of a roleplaying game that would have that sort of appeal with my non-gaming friends or one that would make me super-excited to share with them.<br/><br/>Edit: <i>Primetime Adventures</i> comes closest.                        </div>

                            PTA seems to get that kind of response from people <i>as a concept</i>, in my experience, but it isn't <i>nearly</i> at the pick-up-and-go level. Coming up with a character and a franchise seems to bring out a lot of paralysis. I wonder if there's room for some "modules" for PTA based on a few common TV drama tropes? Character templates, some franchise color, and maybe a suggested episode or two...                        </div>

<p>Jonathan,</p>
<p>So, in other words, even once the game you're imagining exists you still need to get it to the people.  You've still got to either market it or play it with people or both.  I happen to be of the opinion that not only do the games exist but the best way to get it out there is to <em>play</em> them with people who don't know they exist.  I think we just happen to disagree on that point.</p>
<p>Also, on the subject of crazy dice, paperwork, and the other common accessories to the game.  I cannot believe that these are actually barriers to getting anyone  into playing roleplaying games.  At least not someone who's already interested in playing games of some kind.  Are we talking about introducing people who don't like any kind of game to roleplaying games?  If we are, then I fold, because I don't imagine anything good coming out of that.  I think it would be like trying to teach my cat to moo.</p>
<p>I know there's a wordgame out there that my aunts used to play a lot that had a 24 sided die with letters on it.  Every letter but Z and Q if I remember correctly.  Was real popular for a short amount of time*.  I'm gonna hit Toys R Us sometime soon and count the number of games that use unusual dice.  I just don't believe that crazy dice are a real barrier to getting people into RPGs.  I'm not saying that there's no one turned off by the dice, I'm saying that I don't think that people who enjoy games already are going to be turned off by them.</p>
<p>Paperwork and/or character sheets as a barrier?  How about a little Yahtzee anyone?  Or Clue?  Overly complex paperwork, I'll grant you.  A 4-page D&amp;D character sheet is probably going to turn off all the casual gamers I know.  But just the sheer existence of paperwork wouldn't.</p>
<p>Geekyness sure as hell isn't a barrier.  Trivial Pursuit is about the geekiest game I can think of.  I mean, what's more geeky than challenging each other's useless trivia?</p>
<p>I'm going to stand by my position that the games for the masses already exist.  The magic bullet is <em>enthusiasm about actual play.</em>  And not being afraid to share that enthusiasm with everyone you might possibly want to play with.  It's true that every really awesome game is a good design.  But it's also true that every famous game got that way because the people who enjoyed playing grabbed hold of their friends and got them to play too.  Because they wanted to share that fun with more people.  Call it evangelicalizing if you want to.  It doesn't cheapen the idea of sharing your fun with the people you want to play with.</p>

<p>Oh, an afterthought.</p>
<p>If you need a non-geeky, non-crazydice, non-paperwork RPG to introduce <em>particular</em> non-gamers you know of to gaming, then that's a different story altogether.  You should get to work on that design right away.  My objection isn't to the claim of specific people with specific dislikes, only to this spectral Mainstream Nongamer Boogyman that seems to keep popping up.  That strange creature that seems to dwell in every office space that doesn't like a damn thing about the current image of roleplaying games.  And yet, there's always a gamer that wants to convert that creature to gaming.  Without, you know, using any of the attributes of the hobby to lure the creature in.</p>

                            The current version of PTA has some cool example shows in it...I think I was thinking more of a more specific and expanded section on how to make up shows and characters to fit them. The "supernatural investigation" show has been around in enough forms for long enough that we certainly can call upon its tropes to help us get some good things done - the skeptic, the reluctant investigator, the true believer, the tainted character, as well as some plot tropes: tempted by the bad guys, the ordinary person whose faults are magnified by the supernatural, resolving things via family...that sort of thing for each TV genre I think is what's needed most.                        </div>

While I agree with the vast majority of your post there, Eric, I think the thing that intimidates people about crazy dice system is <em>interpreting the dice</em>.  The Scattergories die with all the letters is funky, sure, but it is also immediately understandable.  Rolling two ten-sided dice and then multiplying one by ten and adding it to the other to create a percentile, and then comparing that to a table or worse, another roll... there's a whole lot of mental operations that are pretty foreign to most folks.                        </div>

<p>So you're really not objecting to the dice themselves, are you?  But rather to a procedure, or procedures, that are commonly tied to them.  The issue is the complex rules, not the funny dice.</p>
<p>I totally dig that complex rules are a turn off to casual gamers.  It's a no brainer.  Casual and complex don't mix.  d20s and casual mix just fine.</p>

                            The only potentially objectionable thing about funky dice is that they are, in some places, much harder to get (ie. purchase) then your average six-sider. Which isn't much of a problem for the average gamer who either knows a FLGS already or purchases his games over the net, but it could be a problem (Although not a big one) for more casual gamers with less connection to the hobby.<br/><br/>Or to take another example: I could play Wushu more or less anywhere in the world, because chances are good that I'd find a bunch of d6 <i>somewhere</i>. But the odds of replacing a d20 when you're sitting on vacation on a tropical island after the evil customs-lady pinched it are probably non-existant.<br/><br/>M                        </div>

<p>Good point.  Accessability of the dice is certainly an issue.  But, at the same time, I'd like to see someone try to replace their 24-sided Scattergories die if they misplaced it.  By that measure, unusual or unique play aides are a hinderance to <em>any</em> game, not just roleplaying games.  Roleplaying games just happen to be printed with the assumption that, if you don't already have the dice, then you're probably buying the game in the same store that sells the dice.  Which is a pretty good assumption right now.</p>

Never meant to say that this is in any way inherent to RPGs. The more a game relies on specific, hard to get components, the more it sucks if these components are lost or have to be bought seperatly. Wether that's a d20, or Arcana cards or the "Chicken" chips of Looping Louis.
<blockquote>Roleplaying games just happen to be printed with the assumption that, if you don't already have the dice, then you're probably buying the game in the same store that sells the dice.  Which is a pretty good assumption right now.</blockquote>Yep. Although I've always prefered games with components that can be easily replaced, like d6s, playing cards, differently colored stones, coins, whatever. Not only makes it easier to take the game with you (If you want to play poker on that tropical island, you don't have to take a pack of cards with you, you just buy one when you're there.), it also means that a game doesn't suddenly become unplayable. (Like Boardgames with special pieces: If you've lost those "Looping Louis" chicken chips, you can't play that game anymore.) Of course, the last one's less a problem with RPGs. (If you ignore exceptions like Arcana or maybe Everway for now.)                        </div>

In the last couple of years, my approach has been as follows: fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.  Now, I know I come off the general public as less incredibly geeky than some of my cohort, and I assume a certain amount of responsibility to be the friendly face of gaming amongst my not-so-geeky peers.  How successful I've been, I don't know, but I haven't been called a Satanist yet.  And more than once it's led to very pleasant conversation.  Articulate, polite passion about a subject is very attractive I've found.  Calling 'em "story games" doesn't hurt, and not raising D&amp;D doesn't hurt either.  (My line about "we've come so far since then" when it does come up may not be for everyone.)<br/><br/>As to an RPG for yer gramma?  Here's a nutty suggestion: Werewolf.  Also goes by Mafia?

As I recall, the big problem with selling games as "boxed sets" instead of just books is that the VAT/duty/something rate is higher on the former sort of product, in those wacky socialist countries. So it's an impediment to selling your stuff abroad.<br/><br/>I still have the dice that came in that D&amp;D boxed set, though. From the days before dice came inked.                        </div>

<br/>
I'll say this: all this Interminable debate of late about what is and isn't an "RPG" is having my head spin for no good reason.<br/>
<br/>
In part because it's tied to the geek factor. It's all a matter of "who's in and who's out". It's all, in my view, part and parcel of that "I'm a wounded outsider, so I'm going to make other people outsiders..." which, of course, only keeps the wounded fellow an outsider.<br/>
<br/>
It's part of the culture of arcana, special words and knowledge and so on that is part of the geek culture. Those "mundanes" over there don't understand us -- but that's okay, because we're calling them "mundandes" and <i>we</i> know what we mean.<br/>
<br/>
I bring all this up to say -- calling them "story-games" is just another way of confounding the issue. It's a new noun that someone will confront and won't know what to make of it.<br/>
<br/>
Follow this: Someone says,"I've got this new game, Trivial Pursuit."<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, really," says the second person, "What's it like?" Or "What do you do?" Or "What happens?"<br/>
<br/>
See, no one is going to describe it by what it <i>is.</i> It's going to be defined by what you do.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the pedantic part...<br/>
<br/>
I suggest not calling them Story Games.<br/>
<br/>
I would put on the cover. "A Game for Making Stories"<br/>
<br/>
Or...<br/>
<br/>
A Game<br/>
For Making Stories<br/>
<br/>
See, simple. What is it? It's a Game. What do you do/what happens/how do you play?"<br/>
<br/>
"Well, you make stories."<br/>
<br/>
To my ear it's a step away from the arcana of geekdom. It says, it's just a game. (Which it is.)<br/>
<br/>
It says, "It's about making stories" (which people love to do).<br/>

The difference I think is that Trivial Pursuit is more mainstream than let's say a Dragon. Look at all the trivia shows on prime-time TV -- they are popular and have been for a good long time. Knowing trivia could probably be considered a more acceptable activity than let's play pretend for adults.<br><br>Thanks, Paul. I've never played Bacchanal, but am going to give it a look again.

<p>Sure Bryan.  You just supported my point there.  Trivial Pursuit is more mainstream than playing make believe.  But that doesn't make it any less geeky.  It's still geeky and it's still mainstream.  Therefore, geeky is not a barrier to mainstream.  But playing pretend might be.</p>

                            Hm.  I think that there's a problem here that people mean different things by geeky.  <br><br>For example, I think there's a perception of fantasy/sci-fi as geeky -- which I think Bryan was referring to.  However, I would note that these days, fantasy, sci-fi, and horror are widely popular in other forms of entertainment like film.  Perhaps because they are relatively new genres, they tend to sell better with the younger generation.  However, certainly a fantasy theme (such as inclusion of dragons) is not considered an impediment to sales of films, or for that matter boardgames or computer games.  <br><br>Personally, I would like more non-F/SF games not because I think they would be more popular, but simply to increase the diversity of RPG players.  For example, I don't think that a mystery game would necessarily appeal to more people than a fantasy game -- but it would appeal to different people, and that opens more choices.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I think the closest point of reference I can make is hardcore sports fans. There's a small portion of the population that spends huge amounts of money on the latest home entertainment setup so they can better enjoy all the games. There's people who memorize players' stats for entire seasons. And if you drop the right codewords, all of a sudden that stranger has some kind of connection you can share. But I've never heard of anyone "closeting" his sports enthusiasm. There's no social stigma for that type of entertainment.<br><br>I mean, if you wear a jersey around bearing a particular player's name, that's not fashion -- that's a <i>costume</i>. That's like dressing up like Legolas in public! It just ain't fair.<br><br>I guess the obvious answer is more sports-themed games.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I think John has touched on something important, and I'd like to expand on it.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people mean geeky as the "color" of the product (SF/F, for example).<br/>
<br/>
But, to repeat what I offered in my last post, geeky is also an issue of <i>form</i>. Does it require mastering lists of spells (which is the non-sports version of the geeky habit of memorizing baseball stats)? Does it require learning a new, often oft-putting language (like the geeks delight in computer jargon)? Does it depend on collecting and grabbing the whole set of something (as buying a whole line of an RPG matches the delight in getting the full run of Spiderman (which I did, by the way))?<br/>
<br/>
I believe there are dozens of components, behaviors and rules that we assume are "part of what an RPG are" that actually completely off-putting because they specifically draw on geek habits and behaviors. We often can't see them beause -- well, that the way RPGs "are" and they are behaviors and habits that seem completley normal to the circle that plays RPGs.<br/>

                            Before y'all get too far down this road, though, consider that almost any hobby activity looks pretty weird and incomprehensible from the perspective of an outsider. It seems to me that you're discussing how to make RPGs a <i>leisure activity</i> (as opposed to a hobby), which is emphatically NOT the same as "de-geeking" them. If what you're working against is the hobby quality (which of its very nature involves esoteric knowledge and development of specialized skill), you're working against a large share of the appeal of the activity. Mastery is a motivator.                        </div>

                            Well, now we're just heading into being mean land.<br/>
<br/>
Though the sitting behind the cardboard accordian-thing is a really good point...<br/>
<br/>
For me the real exercise you started, Levi, is to strip of all the exagerated, extranious bits of geekdom personality and ask about the function of play:<br/>
<br/>
What <i>does</i> the table look like to an outsider?<br/>
What are the players <i>doing</i> while playing the game?<br/>
What do the playing pieces <i>look like</i> to fresh eyes?<br/>
<br/>
Settlers of Catan is a complicated game, actually, but it LOOKS simple because the pieces are oganzied, they carry their weight of information (and then some). They are attrractive.<br/>
<br/>
(I'm thinking now of the "placemats" characetr sheet I saw mentioned on another thread.... Yes! I mean, wipable placemats. Use the same white mat with games that have minimual info -- Dogs, Sorcerer, for example -- that you get to handwrite in different colored markers... laying the info out they way that makes the most sense to YOU...                        </div>

                            Hi Mark,<br/>
<br/>
I'd just offer -- "What kind of weird?"<br/>
<br/>
How overly complicated do the playing pieces HAVE to be? What is the social interaction at the table?<br/>
<br/>
One can say, "I don't understand that, but it looks like fun," and "That doesn't look like fun." A lot of people sitting around for the guy behind the cardboard accordian to point at them so they can speak isn't an appealing image to ME -- and I'm prepping four games to run at a game con in two months. So... I think there's something at stake here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'd also say, "Maybe." I'd say a lot of the points on this thread have been about "de-hobbying" (less prep time and so on...) So, that's something to consider as well.                        </div>

                            I just know that a lot of things that are, actually, a ton of fun, seem weird to someone who's not involved. And honestly, the guy behind the accordion pointing - is that any different than the choir director? Yeah, in the extreme vision, it's worse, but when I look around the floor at a con, that's NOT what I see at most tables. Any more than most sports fans can recite statistics from memory or paint themselves in team colors.<br><br>De-hobbying is a good in its own way - it broadens the scope of the activity, makes it more approachable for people, opens up to new kinds of fun. It's worth doing. But de-geeking is simpler. It depends on the <i>attitude</i> of the hobbyists - do they want to share the skills and demonstrate the fun, or do they want to perpetuate a social dynamic in which <i>they</i> can exclude and dominate outsiders.                        </br></br></div>

                            Hm.  The data point that I have here are that in Scandanavian countries is the closest I've seen to having RPGs be mainstream.  And there, they have pretty much embraced much of what has been called geekiness in this thread.  You have a lot of larps which involve speaking and acting in character, not to mention costumes.  You have a lot of F/SF content.  Tabletop RPGs are strongly represented too, though.  <br><br>As Ken Hite put in his <a href="http://www.gamingreport.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=194" rel="nofollow"><b>Ropecon 2006 Con Report</b></a>, <br><i>The crowd was much younger, girlier, and sillier dressed than an American game convention, which I take to be a result of Finland's very high percentage of LARPs and freeform groups (about which more anon), which have attracted a goodly number of younger girls in silly costumes. Not that, I hasten to add, there's anything wrong with that. Indeed, given my choice between goth girls garbed as butterflies of death and tubby bearded guys sporting self-indulgent T-shirts, well, call me a rebel but I think the Finnish way may just have something going for it.</i><br><br>At the Knutpunkt conventions, I remember in particular conversations with Claus Raasted, who is a Danish larp organizer who had also starred in a reality TV show as a larper.  He felt that the costumes and physical activity made larps something more accessible to outsiders, as there was more visual stuff to watch.  <br><br>Anyway, just wanted to put that in perspective.  I think a lot of what you consider geeky depends on picturing it being done by overweight bearded guys or ugly teenage boys in t-shirts.  While I have plenty of issues with the accessibility of the D20 rules, when I ran D&amp;D for kids at ConQuest, they rushed up to the Dwarven Forge dungeon and the miniatures and were totally interested.

The driving thing behind this - I think - is that dressing up and doing somewhat LARPed things is easy to understand for those who lack the RPG background.  Physical activity is easier to understand and comprehend, even if the goals do no make sense. Dressing up is an easily understood goal. Acting out a situtation is an easily understood goal. Hitting someone with a foam sword is just that as well. It's also easier to explain, and probably easier to learn.<br><br>It's no suprise that LARPing is a youth activity just like football or scouting in Denmark; they don't have complex rules, the setting is easily understood and the activity is meaningfull through physical participation. Examples from LARPs run for young kids by friends run along the same lines.<br><br>As for tabletop roleplaying made easy; strip out the complex rules that take long to explain and to show. Make the theme accessible and easily understood.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            So, never mind how one session of a game looks to an outsider. That's weird enough. Now imagine that outsider hearing that you get together once a week to do this for about 4-8 hours. Shit, they don't even golf that much!<br><br>I think part of the geek stigma is because that we spend a large amount of time playing games instead of going out to clubs, drinking beer, and watching sports on tv. If we were playing chess or Monopoly that much, they'd still call us geeks. Poker players escape the stigma because it's been turned into a socially acceptable activity. It's social. It's considered a game of men (yeah, yeah). People get together, play cards, talk and socialize about things other than the cards, drink, smoke, and do adult things. Role-players get together, play pretend (only kids do that, right?), and scold people for talking about real life. Maybe not everyone follows the teen-aged gamer stereotype with their weekly or monthly game, but that is how the general populace understands gamers.<br><br>And, of course, Mazes and Monsters and the litany of psychopaths whose lawyers found a defense in Dungeons &amp; Dragons haven't helped our image any.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Merten</cite>It's no suprise that LARPing is a youth activity just like football or scouting in Denmark; they don't have complex rules, the setting is easily understood and the activity is meaningfull through physical participation. Examples from LARPs run for young kids by friends run along the same lines.<br><br>As for tabletop roleplaying made easy; strip out the complex rules that take long to explain and to show. Make the theme accessible and easily understood.</br></br></blockquote>
Interesting.  Most people I know were surprised when they learned about the popularity of youth larping in Denmark -- even a number of the Danes whom I talked to.  I'd agree that a beginner's game should be relatively rules-lite, at least relative to the current market leaders like D&amp;D3.5, nWoD, and such.  However, I would point to the runaway success of Magic: The Gathering and Pokemon -- which have rules more complicated than typical family games like Settlers of Catan or such.  
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I think part of the geek stigma is because that we spend a large amount of time playing games instead of going out to clubs, drinking beer, and watching sports on tv. If we were playing chess or Monopoly that much, they'd still call us geeks. Poker players escape the stigma because it's been turned into a socially acceptable activity. It's social. It's considered a game of men (yeah, yeah).</blockquote>
Well, the question is how to make other games into socially acceptable activities.  I don't think it's impossible.  Magic: The Gathering might be somewhat geeky, but anything which can have televised matches on a sports channel isn't doing too bad.  Similarly, Settlers of Catan has managed to be positioned as a family game.  Fantasy larping has gone mainstream in Denmark.  <br><br>None of these are as widely accepted as poker (which has hundreds of years of tradition), but they are still many times more popular than tabletop role-playing.                        </br></br></div>

On the other hand, Magic and Pokemon got most of their players from relatively young segments - like "traditional" roleplaying - and both heavily emphasis the the trading of cards. I'm not sure, but I think that youngsters have more tolerance for "complicated" rules and can put more energy into learning things.<br/><br/>Also, what Adam said; playing pretend isn't considered to be an adult thing, especially when it touches themes that have traditionally been found geeky - fantasy, scifi, occultism and whatnot. This is probably slowly changing as the generations who've been brought up with the geeky stuff are getting older.                        </div>

                            I think this thead and my fizzled one are titled in a way that comes off antagonistic and causes strife. De-geeking has connotations of cleansing - the similarity to denazification made me nauseous when it struck me.<br/><br/>Can I suggest a much healthier way to look at this side of the argument? <b>Decoupling.</b> I am interested in the extent to which it is possible to decouple the activity of gaming (the imagining, the stories/adventures, the social creative thing) from the other elements typically hitched to it. This doesn't mean that these elements should be taken away from gaming, just that they are free to accompany it or to not do so.<br/><br/>Now, "decoupling gaming" still is a big issue - really a whole bunch of big issues - but I hope by framing the broad conceit better we can discuss it a bit more amicably. <br/><br/>It is the holiday season, after all.
