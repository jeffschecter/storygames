(here: <a href="http://summerbird.wordpress.com/2012/02/14/mist-robed-gate-pdf/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://summerbird.wordpress.com/2012/02/14/mist-robed-gate-pdf/</a>)</p>\n<p>I've noticed that, on the heels of this release, I've been getting a good amount of interest in the game; people are running it again and asking for rules clarifications. If you've read it, you know that it is a problematic text and it could be a lot better. I'm looking at this as an opportunity to clarify the gameplay issues that people are having with the game, by explaining the rules more fully and more clearly. That means we'd give a lot of background on how knifework and wirework are supposed to work and what parts of the game they resolve, as well as  providing better play aids.</p>\n<p>What we want to do is produce the game as a book accompanied by set of character, prop, scene, and play cards. The character/prop/scene cards would include a pre-made scenario as well as blanks for you to roll your own, and the play cards that you can use with knifework and wirework.</p>\n<p>I think that creating these tools will make the game a lot smoother in play, but it'll be a significant amount of graphic design and upfront printing cost, so I'm thinking about Kickstarting it, and that's where you guys come in. What would you like to see happen with this? How can I make a new edition of this game that works better for you?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373696/#Comment_373696" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T15:20:03+00:00" title="April 19, 2012  3:20PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2012 3:21PM by Brian_Minter.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since you're asking ... I was excited about this game when I heard about it, but when I bought a copy and read it, it left me completely bewildered as to how I would go about playing. So much so that I never even attempted to play.<br/><br/>In fact, I was convinced my copy was missing essential elements, since the text references those cards you refer to, but doesn't explain that you're supposed to make your own, or what form they should take. It was only when I went to ask questions on the internet that I learned that I did indeed have an intact copy.<br/><br/>Maybe I am just extra-dumb. But a revised version that makes the game playable for people like me might be cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373697/#Comment_373697" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T15:20:12+00:00" title="April 19, 2012  3:20PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm into it.

The extracurricular stuff on food was amusing, the bibliographical material excellent. The explanation of the gameplay and rules was pretty opaque and condensed, but good enough for me. The true hardcore is sufficiently motivated to see through a less appealing text to the core of the game, but I'm sure that the game has lost less motivated people due to the text.<br/><br/>If a new edition were in the works, I'd most like to see a rewritten text that appeals to people and inspires them to play; I think that the current text doesn't quite get there. Apart from that, I'd lean towards a nicely made reading book with no props, as the nature of the game is such that teaching the game and inspiring the reader through a nice reading experience into actually playing is the largest hurdle.<br/><br/>If I was productizing seriously, I'd go entirely scenario-full with the game, probably boxed set; ready-made factions on some widely appealing and colorful topic, two dozen ready-made characters on cards or whatever, a board/map depicting key locations, another depicting the complex and unstable relationship map among the characters. Don't do a book, do a rules pamphlet. Remove the generic scenario-construction advice and rename the game into <i>MRG: Whatever</i>. Advice that while the game can take a lot of replay, it's also possible to get more scenarios off the net or write your own, perhaps with the aid of your book. Write the wider general book on the game separately. Or perhaps don't - what I outline here is already a very wide game, people have gotten a lot of mileage out of e.g. Street Fighter, which has about the same amount of storyline potential all without needing to be accompanied by a separate "how to write a different beat-em-up drama with new characters" book. Put in a good relationship map and 1-2 dozen appealing characters, and people can play with different combinations and emphasis for a long time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373710/#Comment_373710" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T16:12:51+00:00" title="April 19, 2012  4:12PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I obviously love and have strong feelings about MRG, which you can ask me about at your leisure, so I won't re-post them in detail here.  IMO, the game needs to be easier for players to understand and organizers to present, but it is excellent and deserves to be appreciated by more people.  I love it and pretty-much get it but have seriously messed up some things all three times I've run it (for whatever that's worth). One thing it also desperately needs is a way for non-Asiaphiles to either rock the Asian tropes or rock some other tropes that are more comfortable to them, without delving into ugly stereotypes. Example settings and characters, oracles, and other tools could help with that. Or instructing people to pick a familiar media property to riff on (Eero's suggestion of Street Fighter is actually pretty awesome; makes me want to run Mist-Robed Kombat...).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373727/#Comment_373727" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T17:57:46+00:00" title="April 19, 2012  5:57PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played it once at a local con with a mix of adults and kids and it was a very successful session.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I couldn't tell you a bit how close to actual MRG we actually got because we were all pretty clueless and winging it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich means it worked enough to spark creative ideas and free form riffing...but no idea whether we were actually playing MRG, or just playing a largely free form game with a knife on the table that we occasionally did things with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373729/#Comment_373729" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T18:03:44+00:00" title="April 19, 2012  6:03PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2012 6:09PM by shreyas.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Ralph, it sounds like you had some difficulty with the text!

Lin plunged the knife through Kim's sheet with a "I will follow this demand, but if you had any honor yourself, you would end Xhang and his train of destruction." [Essentially, Lin says yes "only if you die soon and don't cause me any more trouble"]<br/><br/>We go to wirework, but the knife is not calmed. "I'll do that [or die trying] so long as the village lives on."  Cut to Kim's death scene, destroyed inch by inch by a hundred brain-washed workers until dying at Xhang's disinterested feet.<br/><br/>-&gt; Soon after Po is on the run with the STONE, Xhang demands it of him, driving the knife into his sheet.  Po does not survive the wirework fight to calm the knife.  Po is split asunder. [Xhang chooses "take the knife" from the wirework.<br/><br/>-&gt; Immediately following, Xhang plunges the stone into Lin "No one will survive that knows the secrets of this STONE."  Lin doesn't go to wirework, but instead wrenches the knife and holds it to Xhang's arm.  "I die to protect the secret, but the STONE dies now to protect the Empire." and shatters the stone in Xhang's hands.<br/><br/>Xhang stands there, amid the bodies of his great rival and his close friend, the dust of the broken artifact falling from his hands, looking twenty years older and burdened with a great weight.

Cool poster attracts attention.  Knife attracts attention.<br/>T-shirt?  ASK ME ABOUT type badge/button?  Also marginally effective.<br/><br/>Player take-homes are a <i>must</i>.  Business cards, bookmarks, etc for random passers-by, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">info on the character sheet</span> is a definite must.  On the bottom or on the back is fine, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">somewhere</span>.<br/><br/>My general rules for Con Demos are:<br/>-&gt; Make it super trope-y up front, and seek out the personal and less cliche once you're settled in.<br/>-&gt; There's no time for red herrings.  This is the fantasy story that outlives the facts.<br/>-&gt; (Especially in a game like MRG) Don't finish the scenario.  Have key facts missing, with a prompt for the players to fill out.  For MRG this is probably just "have factions with opposing goals, have proto-characters, Go.  Toss in Set Pieces if the group stagnates.  Have plenty of Blank Cards that players can win through WireWork."<br/><br/>Also, if the Prop cards are pretty, players will often fight over them, and it's a cool reward to take it home with you if you end the game with it.  Not always, but enough times to make it worthwhile.<br/><br/>Just my two cents.  If this is ready (significantly) before Dragon*Con (Labor Day Weekend) I can test it out there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nocker" title="Nocker"><img alt="Nocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://sites.google.com/site/angrynocker/_/rsrc/1306682518924/jdr/images.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nocker">Nocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374004/#Comment_374004" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-22T04:57:20+00:00" title="April 22, 2012  4:57AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm super excited by the possibility of a Kickstarter of Mist-Robed Gate.
