I've never been a guest of honor before. I know what program items I'm set up for... but what I'm really, well, not dreading, but anxious about, is the GoH speech I'm supposed to hold.<br/><br/>I don't even think I've ever witnessed a GoH speech!

They have been PowerPoint presentations mixing several types of slides: strong, plain, concise text slides for making key points; slides with illustrative images; slides showing supportive data as simple charts; and pithy, memorable quotes from experts and pundits. 45 minutes or so of presentation, with ten minutes of questions. Work to present yourself as clever, engaged, and visionary.<br/><br/>If I were an attendee at TraCon, I would be personally enthusiastic to see you doing two presentations:<br/><br/>One entitled something like "Lessons from L\xe6relyst On Designing Games With Educational Purpose". I'd want to see data that was used to inform some of the key design decisions, and get your wisdom, in retrospect, for how it all played out. Were goals achieved? What did you learn? What would you do differently? Tell some of your most exciting anecdotes from the project.<br/><br/>You follow the international game design scene more closely than probably a lot of attendees. I'd love to hear you talk about international designers and design and publishing trends that are on your radar. Including what you're doing yourself. Give attendees a window into what you're doing, and what others are doing. Use these projects and trends to predict the future. What are we going to see in the next couple of years.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

With Julia Ellingboe at Fastaval 2010, I did an informal interview in comfy chairs in the Fastaval Cafe. Questions from the audience were a central element in both cases. I also prepared flyers describing the guest of honor and showing their picture. Even "famous" people in our circles are known only by few and most people come to RPG conventions to play games with their friends, not to talk with international celebrities. In both cases, about 20-30 people showed up for the guest of honor session.<br/><br/>My best advice is to play games, and socialise as much as you can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275796/#Comment_275796" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-13T06:19:08+00:00" title="June 13, 2010  6:19AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My understanding (based on a somewhat insiderish perspective) is that Matthis was chosen to be a GoH specifically as a strong European indie designer. The difficulty here is that I don't really know if they were originally trying to get a "small press publisher" or "Forge-knowledgeable designer" or what. I suspect that the issue was not hashed out very strongly in advance, they just wanted to point vaguely towards this thing of ours in general. Matthijs was picked over other European options for his long-term commitment to artistic ambition and independence, wide expertise on several pertinent subscenes (specifically Nordic and Forge) and interesting recent activity.<br/><br/>Aside from the above, I'd say that the GoH speech I'd like to hear (if I had the time to attend, that is) would lay bare your philosophy on what roleplaying is, what you're trying to do with it yourself, and what you see in the future for the hobby. Also introduce the most interesting stuff you've done, because most people coming to the convention have never heard of you - in fact, most people organizing the convention have never heard of you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275799/#Comment_275799" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-13T07:18:47+00:00" title="June 13, 2010  7:18AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks everyone, for lots of good, solid advice.
