I really liked the character it provoked from me.  Actual play was highly entertaining.  Brendan and Michael and David and you brought the fire.  I'm sorry to be annoyingly non-specific about this but I'm choked on time right now.<br/><br/>I thought the script was a brilliant way to teach the game's mechanics.  Kudos on that.  <br/><br/>Obviously I want a reference sheet.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>My main critical reaction to the game is that it feels like there's a lot of mechanical friction and ritual that needs to be honored by the narration, and that flummoxed me a bit because I'm not very good at intuiting a complex game's flow and tactics simply by looking at the rules.  I would have to play Mythender some more before the goodness of the complex storm-&gt;thunder-&gt;lightning-&gt;effect economy would be revealed to me.<br/><br/>If you contrast that to other extreme-narration type games like Beast Hunters or Danger Patrol -- those games have mechanical / game resource / narrative interplay that's simpler and more direct.  I felt like I understood their flow within the first couple turns of play.<br/><br/>So I'm interested in asking what prompted you to choose that economy, and what benefits do you see from it?  I apologize for the blunt request that you justify your game's foundation; the answer to this question might be obvious to everyone but me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218754/#Comment_218754" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T11:32:02+00:00" title="July 16, 2009 11:32AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>If I can't handle someone asking that bluntly, I have no business publishing to a public. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I have to start with a round-about answer.<br/><br/>So, I love <em>300</em>. And even the CGI <em>Beowulf</em> flick is a guilty pleasure. They action sequences are about crazy badassery -- but they each have an arc. They start off low and build up, with people trying risk maneuvers out of crazy desperation because they *feel* that they have no other choice.<br/><br/>Mythender is meant to engage the senses as much as it does the imagination -- especially tactile. That's why there's an insane number of dice, and that's the criticism against it that I've chosen to live with. When you see me rolling 20 dice, and see that I'm grabbing 6 more dice because of than and grabbing these other tokens to hurt you with, you've got a sense of where you stand when you're only rolling 10 at the moment.<br/><br/>When someone says in D&amp;D "hey, this foe has a Strength of 20," you might think holy fuck -- and I've been in plenty of games where the noting of how badass something is has had an impact (including my own "All halflings are one level higher than you" D&amp;D trick). But, it's paled in comparison to seeing, for yourself, that your opponent has a crapton of dice, and you're going to have to pull out all the stops to kill that die pool down.<br/><br/>Since the Thunder dice you keep accumulating are also effectively your hit points, you also *feel* the effect of being hurt (or, in those rare circumstances where you don't lose any dice, feel the near-miss).<br/><br/>To get back to a direct answer to your question: the economy intends to link some of the more primitive (for lack of a better word) parts of our brains to the rises and falls in the fiction, marrying unconscious and conscious reactions, in an attempt to bring these dramatic fights more alive, to provoke similar feels that I get out of watching <em>Three-fucking-hundred</em>. However, they never do that during the first game, because people are working to make sure they get the rules right. They do once uncertainty of the rules gets out of the way.<br/><br/>As far as inspiration, well, playing Beast Hunters actually fed into Mythender -- the actions you did to gain advantage points, and then the buying of an effect with those advantage points. (If I'm recalling playing it two years ago right). I haven't played 1.5 yet, but I really should. And then a couple years back I made a note about some die mechanic where successes on one die gave you these other sort of dice, and those dice gave you current to hurt something. That started as an intellectual way to model "let's assume you're always hitting with your attacks, but we only care about critical hits when it comes to damage" while ensuring that such critical hits would actually happen. It grew from there.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>My main critical reaction to the game is that it feels like there's a lot of mechanical friction and ritual that needs to be honored by the narration, and that flummoxed me a bit because I'm not very good at intuiting a complex game's flow and tactics simply by looking at the rules.</blockquote>\nAnd you're right to call me on that. That's something I'm working hard to turn into something more easily understood without changing the mechanics. Right now, that text is being worked through really hard, because the complexity is just enough to, well, make it so that I *have* to have an Introduction to Labors chapter where I just give you a script on what to do for three turns. Granted, it seems to work, and thank you for the kudos there, but I feel like having to rely on that is a weakness of the game.<br/><br/>Or maybe I'm just being hard on myself and a tutorial mode is fine.<br/><br/>In any case, that answer your query?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218823/#Comment_218823" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T14:45:06+00:00" title="July 16, 2009  2:45PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was a big fan of the script as well, although I agree about the cheat sheet--once I had a decent handle on the flow of the dice, I wanted to see all my options laid out flat instead of in a guided sequence.<br/><br/>I will say that I really like Mythender's economy, because it engages both the part of my brain that wants to be tracking lots of numbers AND the part that wants to charge up my hammer with a bolt of lightning and split an iron maiden in half.  I have fun with "narrate the fuck out of it" games like Danger Patrol, obviously, but there's a little nagging voice that keeps telling me I haven't "earned" the awesomeness I'm talking about.  The root cause of that is pretty obvious:  I spent years of lonely fun poring over AD&amp;D 2 books and I have a deep-rooted belief that the awesome must show up in the numbers.  Mythender provides a tidy shortcut through all that and into fun.<br/><br/>I did find myself sometimes getting confused about how and one accumulated or spent Lightning versus Might.  I found myself thinking of each as "the thing you get from Thunder that isn't quantified by dice," and kept conflating them.  I haven't read the book yet, of course, which I hope delineates them more clearly.<br/><br/>It was cool getting to recreate my character from last year--a cold-eyed, twelve-year-old French girl who was the lone survivor of the Children's Crusade.  (Damn, now I can't remember what I named her!  It was probably stolen from Les Mis.)  The character sheet was more fleshed out, and useful as a sort of flowchart/play mat to guide you through steps and organize your big piles of dice and tokens.<br/><br/>The refreshment scene, which never came up in my first game at GPNW '08, felt pretty intuitive and made for a nice change in the tempo:  I think it's a positive addition.  One thing I did miss was Ryan's repeated question from that first game:  "What's your action panel?"  I know you've explained why you stopped describing it that way on the Master Plan, Ryan, but I remembered it as a really useful expression about what kind of narration you wanted.  It would be cool to see the "action panel rule" as an optional sidebar in the game text.<br/><br/>The only disappointment of the game to me was a flag failure that is totally my fault.  I don't remember exactly how the system works now, but basically, you can choose at certain times to amp up your Mantle, either to absorb damage or hit harder.  Doing so gives you a boost, AND lets you buy and activate new permanent powers--but of course it also brings you closer to a mythic existence yourself, dooming you to godhood and forcing your companions to hunt you down.<br/><br/>I'd held off on taking those "sweet, sweet cookies" (as Ryan calls them) because I wanted it to make an impact when I did--my little French girl was a pretty hardcore Christian fanatic, and tempting her into taking on mythic power would be a very serious step.  So in the final battle, as Thor was pounding on us and I was starting to take serious damage, I mantled up and bought a new power:  Invulnerable, which let me spend Might to take a normally fatal hit and surge back with extra Lightning in my pool.<br/><br/>Except I wanted this to come as a surprise, so I didn't tell Ryan about it!  And I think he was trying to balance the hits out a little bit, to be fair to everyone, so I never actually got hit again.  If I had it to do over again, I'd pass him a note.<br/><br/>I remain a big Mythender fan; it was the crystallizing experience of GPNW '08 for me, and I can't wait to bust it out at my own table when it's published.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218826/#Comment_218826" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T14:50:45+00:00" title="July 16, 2009  2:50PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, that post just makes me want to play Mythender more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a part of my brain that is all about the tactile elements of dice mechanics.
