It could be the intersection of several characters' individual stories.  It might not even have a character in it at all.<br/><br/>Again, I don't really get attached to my characters.  Whether it's in a story game or perhaps practicing improv or writing a short story.  Characters are simply a means to an end.  And the end, for me, is to tell a compelling story.<br/><br/>But it may just be that we differ on this point.

And I like other players to make offers that I can accept.<br/> <br/>But too often, other players aren't trying to notice offers. And too often, other players aren't making offers.<br/> <br/>It's like a story baton: You're running, and you're supposed to pass off the baton to the next runner. But sometimes, that runner doesn't notice your baton and instead begins running with his own, leaving you holding a now-useless baton. And sometimes, when a runner should be handing the baton off, he instead keeps running with it, leaving you empty-handed.<br/> <br/>I am not speaking of pacing or narrative focus or even hogging the spotlight. I am, rather, speaking of narrative offers being ignored or rejected instead of taken and run with.<br/> <br/>What I like is when my offers are being noticed and accepted, and when offers are being made that I can notice and accept. This rarely happens. Which is my chief complaint about roleplaying -- most roleplayers are not trained to do this. Most roleplayers want to tell my story instead of our story. Most roleplayers want to determine the story rather than discover the story. While they're busy determining, they're missing the story that could be unfolding right in front of them. Which is immensely frustrating to be a part of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93091/#Comment_93091" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T22:43:36+00:00" title="September  4, 2007 10:43PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris: Absolutely.

But working collaboratively <i>in</i>-character more than out-of-character. By which I mean the characters are driving each other's stories in-game, not that they're necessarily getting along or working together in-game.<br/><br/>I also like the collaboration to be fairly invisible. Which means I don't care for systems that have too much out-of-character collaboration -- PTA being an example. I like the offers to take place within the context of the game. Which means the players have to be in sync, because no one's going to say, "Dude! You should totally do <i>this</i> now!"<br/><br/>It's a signal-to-noise ratio. Games like PTA often have too much noise. It's the old immersionist complaint.<br/><br/>Strangely, I don't mind the noise if there's a <i>lot</i> of it. Vasco, Crystal, and I have this way of playing schizophrenically, passing constantly back and forth between in- and out-of-character with no transition between the two, that raises the noise level to where it is, in effect, invisible. (Noise invisible? Ugh. But you get the point.) This is my absolute favorite way of playing, but it's not for everyone. It involves, for one thing, everyone at the table playing <i>all</i> the characters <i>all at once</i>. Player 1 will say something as Character 1, Player 2 will respond as Character 2, Player 3 will respond as Character 1, Player 2 will respond as Character 2, Player 3 will respond as Character 3, Player 1 will continue as Character 3, Player 2 will respond as Player 2, Player 1 will respond as Player 1, Player 3 will respond as Character 1, etc. Basically, if <i>anyone</i> at the table has <i>any</i> idea, he's supposed to throw it out, right there right now, no matter which point of view it's from or whether it's in-character or out-of-character. And the other players respond in kind. All at once. As I said, schizophrenic.<br/><br/>But if I'm not going to go that far, then I like to keep the noise down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93134/#Comment_93134" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T07:22:22+00:00" title="September  5, 2007  7:22AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I don't "ensure" I get what I want, I just put in elements that contribute to what I want.

The fiction is always an end product, since it is what we retroactively create out of the events that occur (Satu Helio wrote a great piece about rpg as a <a href="http://www.ropecon.fi/brap/ch6.pdf" rel="nofollow">narrative experience</a>, a string of events we make into a story by our interpretation).  <br/><br/>For me, I've found over the last few years that some of my most satisfying narrative experiences have been found at the table.  I'm most happy when I've played out a story that is dramatically satisfying, hard-hitting and that touched me. I've had this experience over and over again playing strongly narrativist games. The ones with more structure and more collaboration on the narrative flow have done it the best for me: Primetime Adventures and Shooting the Moon, most consistently.<br/><br/>What makes me happiest is not necessarily what my character's experience is--I'm happy for my character to highlight someone else's issues, or to provide antagonism for someone else so they can make the story shine.  But what I love most is when the group "goes there", and pushes the limit to give a real twist to the game, and puts the characters through their real paces, or hits on real deep issues in a beautiful or horrible way.  <br/><br/>More end product, but some of my favorite games have actual play like <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18449.0" rel="nofollow">The Hare and Hound</a>, and <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=16744.0" rel="nofollow">Blue Lines</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18523.0" rel="nofollow">A Dangerous Game</a> and <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20989.0" rel="nofollow">Stalingrad '43</a>.<br/><br/>best,<br/>Em<br/>&lt;a href="                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vasco%20Brown" title="Vasco Brown"><img alt="Vasco Brown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/720dbb7653b3d0bf450544cf2959a255.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vasco%20Brown">Vasco Brown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93248/#Comment_93248" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T15:05:05+00:00" title="September  5, 2007  3:05PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>I have to say that for me, the narrative is what I am after and not really the roleplaying.

It's pretty much what drove me to seek out story-games. I suppose I have a high tolerance for signal-to-noise, as Josh describes it, as long as all of it (in and out-of-character chatter) is geared driving an interesting narrative forward. <br/><br/>I don't know if it's because the <i>vast</i> majority of my gaming experience, up until this year, has been in the GM seat, but I highly suspect that it has been a major factor. In my past experiences the weight of bringing the awesome to the table has rested almost entirely on my shoulders, and as far as I'm now concerned, that's the responsibility of every person sitting at the table. If that means having to talk directly to the person across from me to communicate what I'd like to see in game - rather than <i>through</i> my character - so be it. I can think of past games where such candid discussion would have vastly improved the play experience. <br/><br/>However, if the rest of the group can pick up what I'm driving toward, either intuitively through my in-character actions, or based on the flags I've chosen from the system we're using, then rock on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93262/#Comment_93262" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T16:01:26+00:00" title="September  5, 2007  4:01PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe a different perspective on the subject. From a narrative point of view, I'm really looking forward for the players to answer the question : <i>what are we doing with our lives, what are we doing with the time we've been given ?</i><br/>Which has not much to do with in or out of character play. But this seems to me like an existentialist question that comes to me in my everyday live and that I want to reproduce in a game session. And there is an underlined statement there : a player might tell me his character is brave, but I don't really care. Show me that he is brave !! Act with braveness !! Because what would define a character is what he is doing. If, at the end of the narration, players look back at their choices, at what they have done, and they can relate to it thru time and give it sense, then I'm very happy !!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93263/#Comment_93263" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T16:01:58+00:00" title="September  5, 2007  4:01PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Alex,<br/><br/>I'm a mix of what Caesar X, Emily and Vasco have said.<br/><br/>Getting into the character is cool (I love it) but reaching across the table and working together to build something that feel like a whole piece -- that's where it's at for me.<br/><br/>Back in the day when all my focus was on "being in character" I found myself waiting to be involved if it wasn't my turn. But a lot of the new games -- in terms of content and structure -- keep me engaged all the time.  <br/><br/>First the subject matter is always just interesting to me.  I want to know what the Player is going to have the character <i>choose</i> to do.  <br/><br/>Second, a lot of the mechanics support involvement from outside the scene. Fan Mail, in <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, for example.  And, even more interesting in some way, Minutia in <i>Shock!</i>  I <i>loved</i> that mechanic.  It gave everyone at the table a way into the scene and have a stake, if you chose to, to add to it's direction.  More importantly it was all of us working together to build out the SF setting with more details.  Someone would say, "I've noticed this about the setting so far," and another player would say, "Well, what about this," and the third player would slap his hand on the table and go, "I got it.  She's going to get caught because of this new Minutia," and scoop up a 4 sided die.  I loved all us on Sunday night doing that together.<br/><br/>I saw the same things happening during the Grey Ranks game on Friday, in really fantastic ways.<br/><br/>It feeds the characters. And the characters feed the story. And the story feeds back into the characters.  All that shared work means that when I go into the character to find the scene work it's informed by the collective voice of the table.  I'm not doing <i>my</i> thing.  I'm helping in my specific way to build <i>our</i> thing.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93291/#Comment_93291" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T18:26:17+00:00" title="September  5, 2007  6:26PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>It feeds the characters.
