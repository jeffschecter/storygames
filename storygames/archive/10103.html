I've only played it as a one-shot, so your thoughts on making the game build slowly to a boil would be much appreciated.  <br/><br/>I am<i> crazy excited</i> about this - our game is actually going to be "Frost Devils", taking place during the 1899 gold rush in Nome, Alaska.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224207/#Comment_224207" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T06:47:37+00:00" title="August 12, 2009  6:47AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Alaska angle sounds excellent, Jason.<br/><br/>The trap I fall into too often with my own game is that I pace game WAY too fast. I chalk that up to being used to demo'ing and convention one-shots. Characters can get Harmed really fast if you're not careful. The Revenged rules help with Chips. Let players start with at LEAST 4 chips. That'll help them survive. (TRANSLATION: Use recovery scenes!!!)<br/><br/>The most obvious (and important) advice is to play through those first several scenes without reaching for the guns just yet. Just role-play. Let the tensions among characters build rather than explode. Use Folding mechanics. Cut scenes before they resort to some kind of emotional or physical violence. <br/><br/>When conflict does arrive, consider playing counter to your traits and Devils, especially at first. Look pitiful, but earn chips doing it. Build them up. Then go nuts with chips later. You, the GM, can introduce some mild to moderate hazards that might be more "tame" to let characters do this counter-trait stuff. (And, it makes a lot of sense to me that there'd be a lot of hazards in an Alaska game.)<br/><br/>If you've seen Once Upon a Time in the West, you can imagine that first hour or so of a steady grind and build up of "what's going on?" that later explodes with great effect. (Even that first scene where Harmonica shoots the three gunmen waiting for him -- that needn't be a conflict. It COULD just happen without cards. We learn how much of a badass Harmonica is and that something's afoot.)<br/><br/>Another tip -- since you're planning on 3 sessions, you can begin with Devil ratings low. Players set the rating themselves at the start of each session. But, you could have everyone agree to set it at 1 for the first session. You might even consider enforcing a rule where each session builds: <br/>Session 1: All PC Devils = 1<br/>Session 2: All PC Devils = 2<br/>Session 3: All PC Devils = 3<br/><br/>Of course, you'd have to agree to it. It's entirely conceivable it won't fit for so-and-so's character concept.<br/><br/>Lastly, there's always the option of having players play a second or even third character once they face The End with their first. It's pretty easy to make characters in about 5 or 10 minutes. Have a guy die, then play that guy's sister who inherits all his gold and problems.<br/><br/>ONE MORE FUN IDEA: Give the unforgiving wilderness a Devil. Neat! Never thought of that before. Alaska's Devil: Heartless - Alaska wants to kill your mama. Heh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224208/#Comment_224208" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T07:00:13+00:00" title="August 12, 2009  7:00AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Matt, that's excellent advice!

My take:<br/><br/>Start with a few chips. Not too many! Maybe ... 2. Maybe 1 x the number of PCs. I know Matt says 4. That feels high.<br/><br/>I feel like there's a nice timing system already built into the game via the....shoot, the conflict scenes where you're not drawing down against an opponent. I don't have the book in front of me. But they're scenes where the Dealer just draws 3 or 5 or 7 cards. Anyway. I like those scenes because the odds of actually winning them are pretty good, but more important it gives the players a chance to earn some chips. This is why I like the game to start with not-too-many chips, so they're motivated to engage with these early probably-not-Harming scenes. They're betting opportunities, too.<br/><br/>As soon as any player has more than 10 chips you've got trouble. Inevitably we found the game wanted to fall apart at this point. It's such a huge mechanical advantage, which mostly leads to players doubling down on big stacks and having *absurd* amounts of chips at a certain point.<br/><br/>Timing out the game so several players have an opportunity to have their last scene is tough. Very tough. I'd say it's the weakest element of the design, from a table-dynamics perspective. We found that going out was so cool and momentous that we WANTED to go out -- sort of like how you sort of want to go insane in a CoC game. But so you go out, right? And now you're sitting around the table, not doing much but maybe playing some NPCs. We always strove to angle for closely timed last scenes, but sometimes you have to go through some serious creative gymnastics to make that happen.<br/><br/>Last thought: I advise my players on a sort of ideal pace that seems to be supported by the chip economy. Spend a bunch of turns denying your Devil and your Trait, get a couple chips, keep doing that 'til you've got 4-5 chip, then have a BIG blowout scene where you indulge your Devil and your Trait, draw your best possible hand, and double down. It's dramatic, it's fun, and it's mechanically effective. It can also lead you to being very badly harmed and out of chips. It's sort of a pivotal moment in our DD games here.<br/><br/>We contemplated playing with an escalating Devil and I think it'd be great fun in a 3-session game.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224231/#Comment_224231" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T09:15:59+00:00" title="August 12, 2009  9:15AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Paul!  <br/><br/><a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/frost_devils/frost_devils_01.pdf" rel="nofollow">Frost Devils character sheet</a>.

In terms of pacing, we began the game with 3 chips per player, everybody was feeling the pinch of low chip counts about midway through the second session, and started maneuvering to get more.  No gambling (well, one wager, but it went nowhere), but lots of Trait calls and Devil-denying.  As a result Remi ended the session with six, which makes him a force to be reckoned with.  <br/><br/>In the first session we had a somewhat unsatisfying conflict in which Remi's guy, due to a bad draw, got destroyed.  It didn't feel like a pivotal moment but the damage was huge, and Remi chose to write that character off and start fresh.  I supported this choice - his new guy's untarnished Abilities naturally set him up as the foil that will drive Joel and Clinton's guys together as unlikely allies.  <br/><br/>Joel chose "Cowardice" as his Devil, which has been a challenge to indulge.  It's complicated to craft a situation where being cowardly isn't the same as giving your opponent what they want - giving.  At this point the other two Devils - Cruelty and Wrath, are basically writing themselves, so no worries there.  <br/><br/>One thing I've been doing a little is writing NPCs on index cards and handing them out for people not in a scene to play - the game can get a little "my turn"-ish, when players are not aggressively pointing at one another, and this helps.  I've only authored two, but they are the NPCs that tend to be where the action is anyway, and I can easily make them central to scenes.<br/><br/>Oh, and my homework has been well rewarded.  It's the player's game (for example, they chose to make characters centered in town, rather than mess with the gold mining aspects of the setting), but I've been injecting real people who struck me as remarkable.  I read about a Siberian Yupik (well, Yuit) woman named Koopah who "married" a miner on a foray into Siberia, and then through a series of truly sordid adventures ended up an alcoholic prostitute in Nome.  She's in the game, and I have a feeling there's more to her than they think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227656/#Comment_227656" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T14:34:54+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  2:34PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Groovy!<br/><br/>I'm not sure how to promote staking chips other than to maneuver them into fights that are wildly asymmetrical.

At some point in our last DD game, everyone got a bit more...conscious, for lack of a better word, about fighting for the nar rights.

I did not forget last night, and it saved me some damage. Also, I was prepared for the idea that my character could be at Death's door in an instant, and that was a good guide.
