The cutoff would be, basically, can I see them, can they see me, and are we interacting? IF only the first one, that's just being an audience (lots of that in all RP gaming). If you get the second, you start to have at least a faint interaction: I seem them see me, and that "co-audience" thing bring a TOUCH of the third element. Once interacting, one is obviously participating.<br/><br/>It's about the mode and level, or more generally, player motivation to act/engage.<br/>---<br/>Gregor, glad you're here... upon less-excitable consideration, I actually fear it might be pawn stance, because it's a lever onto the play space: I "move my guy" so I can be near those folks or so that I can play with that toy, with no though to what my guy would REALLY do or how my guy's actions shape theme, tone, or narrative.<br/><br/>(I read author stance as "serve the story" or "what would be the best for complicating things" but I admit to only Adept-level comprehension of the Big Model.)<br/><br/>Have I gone Town Crier when, in fact, I just noticed an edge case of a much broader stance?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299507/#Comment_299507" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-05T12:52:58+00:00" title="November  5, 2010 12:52PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya,<br/><br/>David, here's what you wrote:\n<blockquote> think there's at least one more identifiable stance. I haven't settled on a label I like for it yet. Social stance. Buddy stance. Something like that.<br/><br/>The goal of actor stance is to "be the character".<br/><br/>The goal of pawn stance is to "play the game".<br/><br/>The goal of author stance is to "tell the story".<br/><br/>The goal of buddy stance is to "be with friends".<br/><br/>Buddy stance is those times where you're looking right through Joey's in-game persona and talking to him just because you like talking to Joey. It includes those times when you make a decision not entirely based on how your character would make the decision because that decision lets you spend time hanging out with players that you enjoy spending time with...<br/><br/>Buddy stance gets frowned upon because it leads people to do things that are potentially out of line with their character concept and not necessarily good for the story. But it's a genuine motivation that is common to the hobby and should be recognized as such.<br/></blockquote>\nI see several problems with this.<br/><br/>First, are you going to just ignore Director Stance altogether?<br/><br/>Second, being with friends is not a stance at all, it's a Social Contract thing.  Stance theory never cared whether you were gaming with friends, associates, or enemies.  That's entirely beside the point.<br/><br/>Third, I'm with Gregor.  This really looks like Author Stance.  Author stance <i>can</i> care about character motivation, but it doesn't have to.  It seems like you're equating screen time or player interaction to stance.  They aren't the same.  You like your buddy and you want to interact with him during play.  That's fine, but that's at the Social Contract level, not Stance.  Or, if it is Stance, it is definately Author Stance.  Maybe Director Stance if you're talking about interacting with things other than characters.  But anyway, the last line that I quoted from you above is definately Author Stance.<br/><br/>Fourth, Not everything said in roleplay, even LARPing, is Stance.  A lot of things are.  Most things are.  But not everything is.  It sounds like you're talking about social dynamics which are outside the scope of Stance.  "Be with friends" is a Social Agenda, not a technique for how a real person contributes to play relative to a fictional character.<br/><br/>Fifth, size matters not.  The number of people playing is entirely irrelevant to stance theory.  Big or small, all stances are achievable during exploration.  Stance Theory does not require that you involved in all the action all the time.  In fact, it makes it pretty clear that you're not.  Increasing the size of the group does not suddenly open doors to players that weren't already there in the first place.<br/><br/>I recomend you take a gander at these two threads:<br/><br/>Oracle Stance: <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=15462.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=15462.0</a><br/><br/>Archetect Stance: <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=17679.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=17679.0</a><br/><br/>Many of the posts in these threads address your situation.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299509/#Comment_299509" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-05T12:58:49+00:00" title="November  5, 2010 12:58PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, Ara; missed a nuance: I have to guess at "hybrid" as you mean it, but I suspect it's a LARP with off-site, non-event play (message boards, private meetups of limited sets of players with no GM authority), and possibly LARPs that have board-game-like mechanics for resource games or political maneuvering. That surely would include some participant stance play, as one chooses ones meetup attendees or one really digs playing with the board game's mechanics.<br/><br/>I'm struggling, I suppose. But I think the crux is "my guys does X because doing X lets me, the player, spend time with someone particular, play with some 'toy,' or marvel at the scenery." Of course it's a fluid thing--I might wander off into the woods to enjoy the peace and quiet (seemingly non-participatory, but that quiet is the "toy I want to play with" or the "scenery I want to marvel at") and then it occurs to me I could explain my absence, in character, as "My Guy needed time to meditate and commune with nature--it's something My Guy does because he's a druid, yeah?" But the REAL motivation was that I use the LARP, in part, to just get some me-time (I want to participate with myself--heh), some quiet time, some back-to-nature vibes.<br/><br/>Shit... sounding more pawn the more I write about it. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> I thought I'd found something to make me as infamous as Ron! <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299605/#Comment_299605" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-06T08:41:52+00:00" title="November  6, 2010  8:41AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This kind of thing happens in small games too, if I'm reading you right, David.

So I hit the Glossary:\n<blockquote>Actor Stance - The person playing a character determines the character's decisions and actions <b>using only knowledge and perceptions that the character would have</b>. This stance does not necessarily include identifying with the character and feeling what he or she "feels," nor does it require in-character dialogue. See Stance.<br/><br/>Author Stance - The person playing a character determines the character's decisions and actions <b>based on the person's priorities, independently of the character's knowledge and perceptions. Author Stance may or may not include a retroactive "motivation" of the character to perform the actions. When it lacks this feature, it is called Pawn Stance.</b><br/><br/>Director Stance - The person playing a character determines <b>aspects of the environment relative to the character</b> [this, here, is rarely possible in LARP, due to communications problems; i.e., making sure 300 other people know about the new aspects] in some fashion, entirely separately from the character's knowledge or ability to influence events. Therefore the player has not only determined the character's actions, but the context, timing, and spatial circumstances of those actions, or even features of the world separate from the characters. Director Stance is often confused with narration of an in-game event, but the two concepts are not necessarily related.<br/><br/>Pawn Stance - A subset of Author Stance which lacks the retroactive "motivation" of the character to perform the actions. Often but wrongly identified with Gamist play. See Stance.<br/><br/>Stance - The cognitive position of a person to a fictional character. Differences among Stances should not be confused with IC vs. OOC narration.</blockquote>\nOK, got it--Participant Stance is a subset of Pawn, which is a subset of Author.

Click back from one or the other of the above links from Troy, and you'll probably find the origin of Pawn as a subset of Author.<br/><br/>Pawn is just Author without any retroactive character motivation, no justifications like "I did that because my guy...," because the reality was a purely player motivation at the root (Author).<br/><br/>For example, from LARP:<br/>Time T: I notice a cute new player and want to associate with her, the player.<br/>Time T+20: I figure out what she's doing in-game--maybe find out she's on some sub-quest which I've finished long ago.<br/>Time T+25: I saunter up and start a conversation, to try to come up with an "in character" (diagetic) motivation to accompany her.<br/>Time T+30: Turns out that her quest might indirectly bring harm to owlbears, which are my totem animal--PERFECT!<br/><br/>At T through T+25, I was in Pawn Stance, sub-subset Participant Stance... or maybe Lecher Stance! <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> I didn't even HAVE a "motivational" hook on which to hang my player priority--it wasn't even in mind.<br/>At T+30, I shifted to Actor Stance, if one doesn't read the bold "only" too strictly--I had a motivation that hooked my character. (Though, really, the ret-con nature of the motivation keeps it squarely Author, as I now understand Stance.)<br/><br/>The thing that made me post all excited last week was that I thought I'd seen a particular type of Stance--cognitive position of a player to a character--that had NOTHING to do with fiction, nor even <i>with the notion of character or story</i>--it was me, the player, and that, the interesting pastime at the LARP (some cool set, interesting people, etc). Nothing else entered the decision-making process. So I thought, "Hmmm, so I as a player have no position regarding the character at all; it's all about me, the player" and that made me think of Participant (as a generalization of "buddy stance").<br/><br/>Turns out Author Stance already generalizes that body of considerations (and not mere "considerations of Tone and Theme," i.e. Story, as we'd misused it at RPG.net). So Participant Stance is relegated to a hyper-specific mode of player-to-character positioning: no consideration of character at all, with only consideration of the activity in which the player is/will engage. The tabletop equivalent might be, oh, stacking dice or making a character sketch.<br/>-----<br/>As I understand it, zilchplay refers to Agenda, which supervenes Stance (but, yes, informs it quite often). Pawn Stance is a relevant subset of Author. And I think Participant Stance is a meaningful sub-subset of that, as it applies to the types of activities at LARPs (particularly high-action boffer LARPs, intricate line modules, orthogonal-to-plot feasts, "back rubs," etc.).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300042/#Comment_300042" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T10:19:17+00:00" title="November  9, 2010 10:19AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Suna, <br/>Pawn stance is basically when the only priorities being observed by the player are his/her own - any kind of justification or motivation for a character's action(s) are only found on the player-level, not at the character-level.<br/><br/>For example, a warrior is waiting for reinforcements at a siege, and would have no particular reason to charge in before backup arrived.

If some effort is made in the moment, or after the fact, to justify the character's action in terms of the character's desires and motivations, then you're looking at Author stance. If no such effort is made, it's Pawn stance - the player is wielding their character for their own priorities without any noteworthy consideration of the internal "logic" of the action. <br/><br/>For both, the player's desires take precedence over character consistency or experience. Does that help?<br/><br/>Also - Stances do not relate explicitly to Creative Agendas of any sort (or zilchplay, for that matter). However, it's quite possible that a given player's "take" on an Agenda could find expression in certain Stances over others - for a Sim enthusiast who loves to focus on character immersion over and above all else, Actor stance could make sense, but Sim play is not defined by Actor stance.<br/><br/>It might seem like Actor stance wouldn't fit with the explicit metagame priorities of Story Now and Step On Up play, but there's a continuum on which, say, Nar players fall - folks like Eero Tuovinen have described a disinterest in very mindfully deciding what would be "good for the story", and good mechanics should (imo) replace the need for players to explicitly "mind" the story, instead simply making choices that they find satisfying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
