Shared booth, hotel, travel...<br/><br/>I've been going to Gencon or Origins for over a decade for pure pleasure, not profit. So I'm used to treating my expenses at Gencon as vacation money. I'm completely divorced from the realities of breaking even at Gencon. That being said, my understanding is that post Gencon, having a Gencon presence can boost sales just from the exposure Gencon gave you.

My sales were as good as I could have hoped. That covers essentially booth, flight, hotel and a little bit. That's nothing to sneeze at, but it doesn't touch printing prices. Once I've sold out my first print run (knock on wood), then my full trip and printing costs will be covered. That said, Gen Con exposure is proving to be pretty essential for achieving that goal. <br/><br/>My goals are undoubtedly different from the goals of other people. My plans include turning games into a mildly profitable business, but it's meeting and hanging out with lots of great people, gaming, talking, and sharing ideas that really makes it worthwhile.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164726/#Comment_164726" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-24T08:47:10+00:00" title="August 24, 2008  8:47AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's hard to break even within the local four days of the convention.

Sales did not pay for the booth buy-in. This is good as typically my badge will be free as a press-type-person. I don't think I'd count the cost of the hotel as I'd be there anyway, the hotel I count against my podcast. Someday I hope I can actually do that without chuckling. So 20 more copies would have paid for my buy in. <br><br>Having some type of done project, that has been assigned a value ($6.00), I think will pay off the $125 booth buy in over the long run due to the increased quality of the game, plus increased visibility, I expect to see through criticism or praise.

Say it costs at least $500 to be at GenCon, between hotel, booth, food, travel etc.  If your book costs $20, that means you need to sell 25 copies to pay for the con, and probably several more to cover the print costs of your game.  So 30 copies is about the minimum for breaking even, I think.  Many games sell few copies than that, in the teens, and only a true "con success" sells 50 or more these days.  Breaking even is difficult, but not impossible, especially if you have a new, anticipated product.  Without either a new product or a highly anticipated one, it's very rare that people break even.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164742/#Comment_164742" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-24T09:53:37+00:00" title="August 24, 2008  9:53AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now, I'll grant, but we haven't attended Gen Con as an exhibitor so our numbers are somewhat dated.<br>\n<br>\nBack then a full booth would cost about $950 or so rather than $1600 or so now. Our magical break even, accounting for total trip expenses and cost of goods sold was around $2,400. We would usually achieve that, but not much more. These days, with price increases on booths, hotels, etc, I would guess that number to be about $3,500 at least.<br>\n<br>\nThe thing is, you also have to value your time. Attending Gen Con as an exhibitor as also a time sink. You've got several days before the con that you are preparing product to ship to the con, preparing booth signage, preparing support materials for gaming events, etc. You've got booth set up day and then 4 days of convention and at the least the day you come back to unpack and unwind. Counting pre time, that is at least 8 days done. 8 days that could be used to do something else for your business. Once you factor in your time, the amount of sales you need to make essentially doubles. For us, we ultimately decided the investment in exibiting had become not worth it and those 8 days could yield more profitable results if worked in other ways. Though I'm pretty sure, at some point, we will return to exhibit at Gen Con to see if we can generate the types of sales that will make it worthwhile year after year.<br>\n<br>\nRyan S.

That's roughly leveling the price of our various books and considering printing costs and IPR fees.   Our actual sales were about half that.  However, we generally think of our goals for Gen Con as a mix of sales, marketing, and reward for our work, so I'd consider our sales levels a success.<br><br>Put another way, we're not likely to ever sell enough games at the Con to justify the expense of hotel, flights, badges, booth buy-in, etc. for the three of us, but our presence there does a lot for our marketing efforts (demos, meeting people, etc.).  In addition, it's one of the few ways in which the business is profitable to us individually- sales of our games throughout the year help pay for us to be there, allowing us to meet new friends and play games.  <br><br/>If we wanted to increase our profit, we'd probably only have one of us attend, if we came at all.  We considered that for this year, but I'm really glad we changed our mind, because I had a lot of fun and it was good to have all three of us together in the same place.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164772/#Comment_164772" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-24T11:48:36+00:00" title="August 24, 2008 11:48AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd have to seel about 50 to pay for Gen Con (which is about what I sold).

Now, for me, I know I would be attending GenCon anyway. I even know at this point that I'd be staying in the Embassy Suites (that hotel rocks) so it's hard for me to count that expenditure as anything other than a vacation. I did cover my booth fee and more with those sales. If it was 20 sales, I even helped cover a new print run. <br/>However, if the booth fee goes up to $500? Well, I better have a couple extra products next year is all I'm saying. $500 in booth costs would take a minimum of 30 copies of really any of my products sold to make it pay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164974/#Comment_164974" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T12:24:04+00:00" title="August 25, 2008 12:24PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I sold 12 copies of Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium via IPR, and 4 copies to the Finnish Contingent (for fifty bucks). My travel costs were ten dollars, including hotel and flight (cashed in some frequent flyer miles). Cab fare was a total of a hundred bucks. Brought food with me (power bars). Printing and shipping costs for 16 copies came to about $175 (I actually printed 25, but the other 9 were mailed home so that I can sell them directly to people at other cons).<br/><br/>So, I figure I broke even. I don't know for sure, since I don't remember how much I'll be getting from IPR. Figure I'll find out soon. But since I spent a total of $285, and the Finns paid fifty up front, that leaves $235. 12 copies of Dread is $300, so if I get, say two hundred bucks from IPR, that's close enough to breaking even for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165220/#Comment_165220" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T06:59:03+00:00" title="August 26, 2008  6:59AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i would guestimate that number hovers around 50 for most people.<br/><br/>It's about 65-70 for me, assuming i'm selling with the forge booth model.
