                    I am working through the mechanics for Hither Lands: Roleplaying in Middle-earth. This version is very much different from the original design, in part due to all of the indie games which have caught my eye over the last year or so. It is a much more narrative approach and for Conflicts the consequences are more abstract.<br/><br/>Here is a brief rundown:<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Conflict: In Hither Lands, Conflict is not merely a series of die rolls; rather the Narrator and players describe the events in detail to further the story.<br/><br/>Abstract Design: Epic moments of strife and struggle are often accentuated in Middle-earth. Conflict in Hither Lands is not broken down into rounds that are presented as standard fare in many other roleplaying games. Instead, the Conflict here uses a progressive, narrative model to act out the unfolding event. <br/><br/>A Three-act Model: Conflicts can be narrated to take place over the span of a few moments or even several daysâ€”as in Aragorn, Gimli and Legolasâ€™ relentless pursuit of a band of Uruk-hai across the plains of Rohanâ€”regardless both are similarly resolved in Hither Lands. Conflict is often used to represent actual fighting, but this system can be used to narrate any Conflict between two or more opponentsâ€”from the art of seduction, to a game of riddles. The three-act model of narrative Conflict begins with Introduction, followed by the Confrontation, and finally comes to an end with the Resolution.<br/><br/>Introduction: Setting the stage and establishing the opening moments of the Conflict is the Introduction. It has three crucial components: Effort, Intent and Circumstance. Initiative in Hither Lands is different from most other typical roleplaying games. <br/><br/>Effort â€” using their Courage points, players will determine how much Effort their character will spend in the Conflict. It is a risk/reward type of mechanic with the one who is willing to spend more being allowed to declare first Intent and React last (along with regaining some Courage points). <br/><br/>Intent â€” establishes the final Consequences for the Conflict.<br/><br/>Circumstance â€” the Narrator finishes the Introduction by declaring any situational modifiers which are applied to either specific characters or ones to all the participants. It is here that the Narrator or player can also call upon a characterâ€™s Road.<br/> <br/>Confrontation: The loser of Effort begins the Confrontation, the next step of the Conflict, by narrating an actionâ€”this is called an Act. This is a single task or short series of closely related actions. The Conflict then passes to winner of Effort, who will then respond with their own Act. There are three Acts for each Player in the Confrontation of a Conflict, with Character who was the winner of Effort getting to react last. Both the Narrator and players are encouraged to creative, vividly relating their characterâ€™s actions in the Conflict, should he be attacking a Troll or impressing tavern-folk with a song. In a Confrontation, the Narrator will judge each Act by the player and will assign to it a Narrative Modifier, as mentioned previously under Circumstance, of -3 to +3 (depending on effort). <br/><br/>That said, there are times when a player is not up to the linguistic intentions of the game. He has, as an alternate to the Narratorâ€™s judging the value of his own Acts, the option to simply spend one point of Courage activating a Boon to give a 1-point bonus, or by spending one point of Courage to automatically invoke a Lore Keyword and receive a 2-point bonus.It should be noted that Foes which are controlled by the Narrator in a Conflict are not given narrative bonuses, though each can have a preset modifier (positive or negative) depending on the circumstances of the Conflict.<br/><br/>Resolution: Once all the Acts in the Confrontation have been concluded, each player tallies their cumulative Narrative Modifiers (and/or other possible options) and moves on to the Resolution. Players will add the cumulative of all Circumstantial Narrative Modifiers for the Conflict and roll a twelve-sided die (d12).  The character with both the highest adjusted margin (after making a roll and then subtracting the opponentâ€™s roll from the characterâ€™s, and calculating the margin of success on the difference) has won a Victory in the Conflict, while the other is Defeatedâ€”and suffers the Consequences established in the Introduction. If a character wins by more than three margins, the Defeat is considered spectacular and the Courage points of the Defeated used in his Effort are rewarded to the victorious player (in addition to the loser suffering Consequences). In the event of a tieâ€”the Conflict it is considered a stalemate. Doom points may be used to alter the Margins of Success.<br/> <br/>Victory and Defeat: As the saying goes, â€œto the victor go the spoilsâ€. Consequences established in the Introduction of the Conflict should be assigned by the Narrator appropriate to the situation, and linked to the Legend, Lore and Consequences of the two combatants. Defeats are nominally divided into three categories and are the conditions representing the degrees to which the loss can affect a character. Based on the Margin of Success (as described earlier in the quick start rules), these are always listed from least to most injurious. A lower penalty for Defeat usually involves some sort of temporary incapacitation. More injurious penalties may be given a numerical rating involving temporary or permanent loss of an Aspect. Possible additional Defeats include: maiming, loss of Courage, acquisition of a new Curse, loss of a Lore Keyword, acquisition a new Bane, loss of a Boon, a change in Doom, or Ruin.<br/><br/>Much to Ruin: Danger comes in many forms; three such are defined as Ruin and are covered in detail (though other affects may come as well in Defeat). In certain Conflicts when a Character is Defeated they may suffer Corruption, Harm and/or Taint. When a character has suffered one or more points in Corruption, Harm or Taint, their Aspect score will be lower in any Conflict until the points are restored. Example, Frodo Baggins has a FÃ«a score of 4 but has been burdened with 2 points of Corruption, so in actions involving FÃ«a his score is only a 2.<br/><br/>Corruption 	â€”	is an effect from foul deeds or wicked influences (may be temporary or permanent).<br/>Harm		â€”	are the wounds suffered by a Companion (Healing occurs in days, weeks, or months).<br/>Taint		â€”	is an affliction caused from delving into a subject too deeply.<br/><br/>Corruption acts to weaken a Characterâ€™s FÃ«a (spirit) and with this burden they begin to fall into Shadow. Every point of Corruption reduces the current FÃ«a Aspect score. If the amount Corruption is one point greater than a characterâ€™s FÃ«a then they are consumed by Shadow and fall under the dominion of the Dark Lord forever and are lost from further play. <br/><br/>Harm is the physical wounds that a character will take in a Defeat. Harm affects a characterâ€™s HroÃ¤ (body) Aspect score. For every point of Harm the characterâ€™s current HroÃ¤ is either temporarily or permanently lost. Should a character suffer Harm one point greater than their HroÃ¤ score they are mortally wounded with no recovery possible. <br/><br/>Taint in some ways is similar to Corruption, yet it affects a characterâ€™s InÃ­tÃ¤ (mind) Aspect score.  Taint can be used to measure the sanity, fears and obsessions a character. For every point of Taint a characterâ€™s current InÃ­tÃ¤ Score is reduced. If the Taint becomes is one point greater than a characterâ€™s InÃ­tÃ¤ Score they will become so disordered (or enamored) by something that the outside world is no longer of any interest.                </div>

                            - cont. -<br/><br/>There have been some who have suggested that each type of opponent should have specific combat consequences. To account for the differences in fighting a Goblin or a Troll. But I'm not sure I want to have a laundry-list of damage. But do you need to have a set mechanical effects for losing a conflict? If not it does seem to be very dependent on the Narrator making some kind of judgement call. Should each Foe have a Ruin value -- how much damage they do as a  consequence of being defeated by them? For example a group of Orcs could collectively have a Ruin of Harm 1 - if you Fail the conflict your Hroa goes down by 1, if you lose by a Mishap, the value is doubled, if it's by a Disaster, it's tripled. That would also mean you could have a Nazgul with Ruin of Harm 3/Corruption 3, which reflects it's physical and spiritual dominance. You could also have a narrative consequence that depends on what you did, i.e. you decided to rush the orcs with your spear and skewer them, so a narrative consequence of  failure could be a broken spear or something similar. I think in  this case the reward remains clear - if you win, you overcome the conflict in the story and suffer no effects, if you fail you take mechanical 'damage' and suffer the consequences, as well as any long-term affect on the way the story progresses.<br/><br/>Or would this be a better route?<br/><br/>In a Conflict the defeated character will lose Aspect (mind, body, spirit) points equal to the amount of Courage spent in the Confrontation. Example: Alendir has spent 3 points of Courage in the fight, but still<br/>loses. The Narrator indicates which Aspects are lowered. The 3 points can be taken from one Aspect or divided out. This maintains the risk/reward element of the Conflict. It also places a natural scaling of damage by Foes, since a player is likely to spend less points of Courage fighting a Goblin than when facing a Troll.<br/><br/>Perhaps a SCOPE level is a way to go? For instance, make a drama/tension scale of 1-12 (with 12 being highest). For every 3 points there is one point of Scope reflecting the 'epic stage' of the Conflict. The higher the Scope the more dangerous it makes a minion.<br/><br/>I would like to get some of your thoughts.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance!                        </div>

                            Under effort, you say that the larger bidder may get Courage points back. How does this happen? Does this refer to the rule in which the character gets his opponent's points back if he gets the 3+ (spectacular) margin of success? Or to some other effect? If that's it, then I'm not seeing where Courage helps. In fact, I'm not seeing where courage creates any advantage at all, other than may be obtained through declaring actions last (which could also easily be a disadvantage).<br/>

Mike thanks for the response.<br/><br/>The winner of a Conflict does get back Courage points, while the loser does not.<br/><br/>Marginal Success = 1 Courage Point is given<br/>Full Success = 2 Courage Points are given<br/>Critical Success = 3 Courage Points are given<br/><br/>Now for getting the other's Courage Points. I have two thoughts. With 4+ margins of success the winner gets what the loser spent in Courage point for the Effort. Or I can give 1 point for each additional margin beyond 3 (4 margins = 4 Courage Points [3 from his own and 1 from the loser], 5 margins = 5 Courage Points [3 from his own and 2 from the loser], 6 margins = 6 points [ 3 from his own and 3 from the loser] and so on. I'm leaning toward the latter as it seems to scale easy.<br/><br/>Courage: Points of valour in Hither Lands are called Courage, and are used by characters in initiative bids versus opponents in a conflict. A point of Courage can also used to give a simple 1-point bonus in a Conflict when a player chooses to forego any potential Narrative Modifiers. A player can also activate Boon with a Courage point, and then decide to take a simple 2-point bonus or narrate the action for a possible 3-point bonus. Courage points can also be used to remove the effects of Corruption, Harm, or Taint on a character. The number of initial Courage points is determined by race (or culture) and has been discussed earlier in the quick start rules. Under most circumstances, Courage points are completely refreshed after each session of play.                        </div>

                            Mike, here is another thought. You had indicated that by going last may not be an advantage at all. But how about about spending a point of Courage to counter/cancel the opponent's Act or something to that effect?                        </div>
