Admittedly, most of them seem to be played by the same group of players, but that's no bad thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, post here when you've run/played in a game on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23playnow&amp;Mode=like">#playnow</a>, and let us/the rest of your group know how it went. And then people can see how games are actually happening there.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, earlier today I ran a game of 3:16 which was almost a complete bloodbath at the end... despite the aliens fluffing all but one of their rolls (like, in the entire planet).<br/>\n<br/>\nI know other stuff has been going on recently, so share your IRC-based tales of quick games with people you've never met.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248976/#Comment_248976" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-29T08:37:15+00:00" title="December 29, 2009  8:37AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got a saturday night Apocalypse World game going on that's on a bit of a holiday hiatus, but still a lot of fun when we play it.

I'm hoping Millsy chooses to do a follow-up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
