It's being run by JB, and our game pitch is:\n<blockquote>You're a survivor, a child of conflict. No, not someone who's had all his or her dignity destroyed by war, left only with scars and a thousand-yard stare. You've been there, you've seen how scared the grown-ups are, maybe you have seen things you'd rather forget. Maybe it's just a family war, or a region-shattering affair. But you were protected. A parent, a loved one, a kindly cop or soldier, someone looked out for you made sure you didn't take the full brunt of the violence around you. Your innocence is still there; you are still a child.<br/><br/>But something was enough to send you over, into The Wood. The rules are different here. Ogres, elves, giants, dashing heroes all exist here, in their joy and terror. And they all talk in hushed tones about Lord Iron, the dark beasts in hope of a new time of free hunting, and the heroes with grim foreboding. They say the White Rose (is it a rose, or a person, or something else?) may stop Lord Iron's advance, but no one knows much else about it.<br/><br/>Courtesy counts everywhere but it doesn't seem to be the same anywhere, so you must step carefully to navigate around the strange manners and prickly tempers of the different peoples in The Wood, try to secure a place, and perhaps return to a home where you can do more than flee evil.</blockquote>\nNow, there's some discussion over some points - Daniel and I are squabbling over the importance/non-importance of innocence, but that pitch basically holds true.<br/><br/>I have an idea for a character, and I want people to help me with some historical jibberish.<br/><br/>What I have so far: Emily, a nine year old girl, fled to The Wood to escape . She is wide-eyed, has pale skin, dark brown hair and dark brown eyes. She is friendly and constantly seeks to understand emotions. The Woods are a scary place, but also a wonderful place - unlike the  she left behind in , the problems here are personal, tangible, and can be solved. She wants to solve the problems of others in The Woods, and maybe she'll feel that in doing so, she is somehow going to be able to move past the notion that she cannot comprehend or resolve the problems happening in her homeland.<br/><br/>It's the  that needs to be filled in. I was thinking post-WWII communist Poland as a homeland, and her family was facing persecution as non-supporters... and then maybe her uncle had her flee into The Woods when the police came by.<br/><br/>I want some help solidifying this though. Thoughts? Details?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66599/#Comment_66599" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-02T13:23:15+00:00" title="May  2, 2007  1:23PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2007 1:26PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there are actual Poles who post here and around (Filip, Dro, etc) who would be better resources for you, but I can give you a general gloss.<br/><br/>So her dad loved his country, right?  And they lived in the big city of \xc5\x81\xc3\xb3d\xc5\xba, and when the Germans annexed it her dad joined the Home Army and fought valiantly in many parable-worthy clashes and acquitted himself like the hero he was.  Your character was packed off to the country for the duration, to a little farm near Konin, and the woods were filled with gunfire.  When you asked about it, your uncle told you grimly that the Germans were celebrating.  And after much trauma and hardship, the hated Germans were kicked out and dad greeted the Soviet liberators with open arms and was promptly arrested.  The Home Army were now reactionary, pro-fascist traitors to the cause of a Polish Socialist state.  You heard all this when the commissar (a big man in a ratty uniform with red shoulder-boards) came to have a chat with your uncle about the disposition of his farm, and his general sympathies.  And into the woods you went, like uncle had taught you to do, and the last sound from the old world was the crack of a pistol.<br/><br/>This could be hella darker if you want to go there.<br/><br/>Oh, and Emily?  Maria, Maja, Irena, Halina, Irmina, Alina, Antonia, Alicja, Ada, El\xc5\xbcbieta maybe?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item
