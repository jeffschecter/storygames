It is also efficient and fast to get going.  You've got a list, go sit down.  The social negotiation piece is side-stepped for good or ill.<br/><br/>I love the idea of carving out time for a massive pitch session (one minute and then the giant hook) so people associate names with faces and games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215359/#Comment_215359" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T09:31:36+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  9:31AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first Go Play was purely organized around pitch sessions and signups and the beginning of each block.

Assigning someone to look for people who are not in games and helping them get into games.</blockquote>I have direct experience with this, in a variety of ways:<br/><br/>* DragonCon, last year, several of the RPGs for the Friday (?) evening slot had trouble making numbers and, further, had to be allocated to tables in rooms that didn't yet have "enough" tables (there were plenty for the actual, full games that ended up being played). So they had everyone posse up in a room that was setup for speakers (chairs in rows, podium) and each GM with at least two or three players read his or her blurb and then others in games that didn't make could join in. As the game that I wanted to play didn't make, it was ideal for me... and for the GMs whose games didn't make, too (don't forget them!).<br/><br/>* In every regular LARP I've played, there's enough influx of new players each session that there's a brief "staff intro" during opening ceremonies, where the organizers get up and introduce themselves and explain their functional role at the LARP. This way, new players know to whom (and where) to go with a particular issue, rather than playing goose chase bouncing from one ST to the next.<br/><br/>* I have GMed for a couple of demo slots that never made, and as such it's a REALLY good idea to have a sort of "be five minutes early, start ten minutes late" time formally scheduled with each slot so that (a) folks can get to know each other a bit OOC, get their playing shit sorted out (dice, pencils, minis), and generally do the time-wasting faff outside of game time; and so that (b) GMs and players whose games don't make have time to realize it and quickly ask around and/or hop into games with open seats.<br/><br/>As a result of one or two times being caught with nothing to run or play, I now have a "backup game" or two for EVERY slot of a con I attend, whether running or playing. Formalizing this sort-and-shuffle process with a scheduled block of time to "gather, pitch, and split up" is A Good Idea. I wish more mid-sized cons did it (obviously, the Majors can't).<br/><br/>Potential drawbacks exist, though: if folks know this is how it works, you might not get ANY sign-ups, with people waiting to commit until the last possible minute, thinking something new and sweet might come along (males are VERY prone to this behavior).<br/><br/>You also run into a Cult of Personality problem, with the inverse of the "pick teams" alienation: folks are pitching their games ahead of That Cool Dude Who's Running That New Hawtness, and getting no takers, and having to join the player pool after getting up on stage and pitching. Owch. At least when a sign-up sheet is blank, you can just shrug and say, "Oh, well"--you don't have to look out on the nonplussed masses and hear the crickets chirp for a moment before stepping off stage for the Real Act. Oh yeah, and that guy gets flooded, so you need some kind of lottery process.<br/><br/>That could be an extreme case. But unhappy GMs make sullen alternate players.

Shake their hand. Ask them what games they like and if anyone wants to run a game. Keep pitches short: "There's Inspectres. It's a mystery game that's a bit like Ghostbusters. The players end up making up the mystery". Matchmake people into games.<br/><br/>If there's a larger crowd, use the SteveCon method, which is that Steve yells from the middle of the room "Good evening LONDON! I'm STEVE and this is my CON! Make some NOISE! YEAH!". After the wild applause and chanting of "Steve CON! Steve CON!" has died down, ask who wants to run which games, and matchmake as before.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215451/#Comment_215451" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T12:52:13+00:00" title="June 30, 2009 12:52PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was thinking to add that it could be broken into Categories if the numbers got too big for the space (i.e. nowhere to get every attendee together).<br/><br/>WHAT those Categories would be is, perhaps, another thread.

So you sign up, know who else is playing in a game, and can talk with the folks running it who are standing around with nametags on to the side of the sign-up table.  And then, when you've reached the maximum number of people for your game, you grab your sheet and go sit down and get started.  And, if you wanna try to squeeze more people in, you draw an extra line at the bottom of your full game sheet or whatever.<br/><br/>But I also think pre-registration is the devil, so I'm clearly a bit biased.

The game-arranging only takes ten minutes, which is as long as it would take to use any other method of arranging games. You have the advantage that everyone is there, ready to go to a table and play. You don't need to ensure everyone's there, as you would if you'd pre-registered. <br/><br/>Also, as you sort of imply, talking to people before games is a nice thing to do, not to be seen as a waste of time. My only doubt is how well this system would scale, but I can see it working for 30 or 40. Above that, you start using Jonathan's sign-up sheets, I think. <br/><br/>Yes, there was a host at GoD.

Maybe if you only had 2-3 hour slots, that would be hard, but if you have 4 hour slots and lose 15 minutes on each side, that's not a big deal and  lends itself to a more relaxed atmosphere overall.  Also, I feel like people don't have as many complaints later that they never got to talk to X person because they were too busy playing fun games.  I feel like, sure, games are what bring us together initially, but it's really the people that keep folks coming back, y'know?

The signup forum and sheets enabled me to hit most of my victory conditions, ensuring I got some game in with Chris, Blake, Brendan, James, all the various Matthews, and Mythender.  I only see those people irregularly, and reconnecting with them over a game is joy icing on the GPNW happy cake.<br/><br/>And more awesome, even with all these reconnections going on I still managed to game with some wicked new (to me) people --  David R. Drake, Jeremy, Mike, Darrin, I'm lookin' at you guys.  So even in the midst of all this socially stratified old-boy shit, there were new relationships forged, and that feels like flawless victory.<br/><br/>That said, if I were a newbie who knew nothing about anything, I'd love the individualized care and social flattening of the group hug / pitch sessions.  The mere one time I was at loose ends at the event, I was really touched by Phil's solicitousness, how it was obvious that it mattered to  him whether I was having a good time or not.  And I know GPNW would still have been worthwhile even if all the planets had aligned wrong and I'd not gamed with any the people I'd marked as essentials.  Fun stuff just simply happens to me there.<br/><br/>I think it all has value, and a hybrid of the two approaches feels like a good approach.  <br/><br/>Maybe I could try offering up a game for n players with n-1 prereg slots and then (assuming I fill up in prereg) attend the group hug and recruit the final player there with the stipulation being that it should be someone I've never ever gamed with before.  That'd serve my own interests nicely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215506/#Comment_215506" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T14:45:39+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  2:45PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, this suddenly sounds like a thread about play preferences.<br/><br/>I like pre-reg because it allows me to know what I am getting myself into.  This is particularly important when I am going out of my way to take lots of time off of work and travel a long distance.  In these cases, I want to know that I am in a game I dig.<br/><br/>But I do like catch as catch can type of stuff.  I also like these kinds of cons (Jiffy Con comes to mind) where I do not know where I'll end up.  This also reminds me of the early days of Dexcon and Dreamation when the indie RPG sessions were just slots and slots of empty games up on the board.  Nowadays, if ya don't pre-reg, most games are full.<br/><br/>At Jiffy-Con, something I really liked was how there was one day for gaming and another for just hanging out but I definitely saw people who didn't know folks in town being left out of that loop.<br/><br/>So, like Jason said, lots of different kinds of devils out there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215525/#Comment_215525" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T15:07:46+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  3:07PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd really like to know what specific practices worked for them at cons.

I knew he would be running Mythender at least once.  If there had been a system such that games were given slots but players weren't allowed to sign up for them, I would have tweeted at Ryan on the side and made him promise me a seat; if all the games had to be pitched on-site for every slot, I would have made Ryan save me a seat before he even went up to pitch.  I can do these things because Ryan is a friend, which is to say he is afraid of me (I am very strong).  I haven't been to Jiffy Con, etc., but I would be very skeptical of claims that nothing of this kind happened there.  Geeks like to prep.<br/><br/>I'm pretty much right behind everything Johnzo says above.  I took the approach of registering for five slots and leaving three open, and it worked out very, very well for me.  I got to play with almost everyone I wanted to play with, and I had plenty of time and opportunity to socialize with both new people and friends whose schedules didn't coincide with mine.<br/><br/>What about an approach where two or three slots per day are pre-reg-available--say, afternoon and evening--and the morning slot is all pickup and pitch-based?  That might allow for the seat-saving that's going to happen anyway, but also encourage a little mixing and breakdown in the strata.<br/><br/>(I should note that I'm proposing a model to be considered and critiqued here, not pushing for a new agenda at any particular con.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215558/#Comment_215558" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T16:22:41+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  4:22PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The last JiffyCon had 70ish, I heard (and was in a rented hotel), but I wasn't there.  There's also some half-assed pre-reg that sometimes happens at JiffyCon, but, generally speaking, only a few people take part.  You have to email the organizers to get on the lists before they're set out.<br/><br/>Over in the GPNW feedback thread, Daniel Wood nailed my feelings about pre-reg:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>...every time I looked at the sign-up boards I couldn't help but feel like there was a tier of the con that I didn't have access to -- an unreasonable feeling, most likely, but there you have it.</blockquote>\nAnd that pretty much only happens when there's a lot of pre-reg that fills up games beforehand, or the same group of 20 people are all playing games together and boxing other people out.  Folks are often more likely to sign up for games with people they know or systems that they've heard of, even if other pitches sound exciting, so I worry that some degree of boxing and/or filling up is inevitable with pre-reg systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215559/#Comment_215559" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T16:24:20+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  4:24PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, maybe it would work if each person were only allowed to pre-reg for 2 slots or something, picking up the rest on site.

I had my own email dance card going before the registrations opened, because there were definitely people I wanted to see.<br/><br/>I believe that the really awful thing with endemic unofficial pre-reg is that because it's invisible, the people who feel shut out are in an even tougher position than they would be with fully public signups.  I know that if there's no room in a desirable game, I would much rather confront the cool neutrality of a full signup sheet.  All that signup sheet says to me is that I was slow.  But if I approach a table of people and provoke a mix of a) good-hearted willingness to share a good time with me and b) resentfulness towards me for messing with their zen -- well, that's awkward. <br/><br/>And speaking of awkwardness -- back home, I knew people who moved in packs at cons because of pretty crippling social anxiety.  A pitch session / group hug scenario, where they might be pressed to explain why they needed to be taken as a team rather than as individuals, would have been real crushing antifun for those kids.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215588/#Comment_215588" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T19:10:14+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  7:10PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's illuminating that we're talking about three different 70-person events (and one 50 person event, Nerdly) that all handle this issue completely differently.

This was a shame because once I'd put the effort in to drag a decent description out of him, he had some good stuff.<br/><br/>I like prereg for LARPS where you need to have a large quorum to get the thing off the ground but in situations where there are lots of players and lots of games, I'd prefer the method Graham describes, it seems more friendly and inclusive and it's how I got to play Misery Bubblegum.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215659/#Comment_215659" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T01:50:07+00:00" title="July  1, 2009  1:50AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Honestly, maybe it would work if each person were only allowed to pre-reg for 2 slots or something, picking up the rest on site.

If you can be at the front of the queue when the sheets are put up, you can sign up as much as you want, and not just for yourself. You can also put your name down for more than one thing if you can't make up your mind. Sometimes the less populist games don't get enough players so you might choose one of them and one 4e for example.<br/><br/>This all means that there can be disappointed people. <br/><br/>It was especially noticeable at Continuum because there weren't enough games. I had been expecting to run one game and play a couple, on top of the LARPS for which I preregged. When I got there, all the first day's games had filled up, except for one which no one wanted to play. In the end, I ran three games because there were quite a few players with nothing to do.<br/><br/>There are ways round these problems and I think a mixture of prereg and turn-up might be a solution, although I wouldn't advocate that for GOD which by its very nature should be on-demand. You might not get exactly the game you want, but there's usually someone who can run a number of things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215665/#Comment_215665" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T04:39:37+00:00" title="July  1, 2009  4:39AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>I am moderately offended</blockquote>\nThis means Graham is experiencing vein-popping rage.<br/><br/>I think there are degrees of "cheating the system" where no pre-registration is offered.

Which tends to be about 30% of the people who attend (friends, family, and people who just heard about the event locally). <br/><br/>In our specific situation we found that pre-registration was very unfriendly to new people. <br/><br/>But from reading this thread and thinking back to a few experiences, if people are traveling out of state for the event, I think we should guarantee they have a good time or at the very least get into the games they want. I think a simple solution would be to have out of towners pre-reg privately and when we post the games at the event have their names already included. We would let everyone know this is what we were doing in the printed material we provided everyone at the event or somewhere on the website. <br/><br/>On a related subject, although I don't like pre-reg for our specific situation, I do think having scheduled games beforehand is crucial. I've been to a few small con events where there were few scheduled games and it seemed like either people would just play games with people they already know or try to run a game on the fly with often unsatisfactory results. <br/><br/>In terms of inclusiveness, I try to run the morning registration at Recess since that's when most of the people arrive. I try to be as friendly as possible. Introducing myself, asking their name, shaking hands, letting them know to come to me with any questions, and asking them what they are excited for or what kind of games they would like to play. I find if you start the event off on a positive note it tends carry on to the rest of the day. <br/><br/>And I wouldn't have guessed it but ordering pizza for everyone was a great way to get everyone socializing by simply eating a meal together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215672/#Comment_215672" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T06:00:30+00:00" title="July  1, 2009  6:00AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, let's talk about some of the points John raises here - I think we've covered registration as it relates to inclusiveness very well.<br/><br/>I see having a designated "greeter" and shared meals.<br/><br/>Camp Nerdly is all about shared meals, since food is what the event revolves around.  You help cook, you help clean, you eat together in a big dining hall.  I totally agree that this is a very potent force for socialization and interaction.  Even on the small group level, eating together is a wonderful way to bond.<br/><br/>So Games on Demand has a gamer/greeter position, a host, and Recess as well.  How about other events?  Does that role take you away from playing or other fun?

They can play as well, but generally step out if people arrive late and need some support.  I've seen Emily play this role at previous Wastern Mass Jiffys and Dev played it at the last JiffyCon Boston.  It definitely means you're often less involved and attached to the game you're playing, because you have to keep an eye out, but maybe no less so than folks who try to keep an eye on their playing kids while blasting aliens or whatever (I get the sense that kids aren't a common factor at GPNW and they generally aren't at JiffyCon Boston, but in Western Mass they are inevitable, because of the make-up of the indie community there).<br/><br/>People are inevitably late for these house / church / hotel cons, so I think a facilitator / host role is great.  I worry, though, as these things start growing and pushing 70-100 people, that we're gonna need someone doing this full-time (like they do at big conventions), instead of the "keeping an eye out" method.  And if one person misses a slot, then you really need at least two people missing a slot so you have someone to keep them company.<br/><br/>The size/growth factor may be another thing to talk about in general.  Like the Forge Booth at GenCon and Game Chef, it's really a factor of our own success but it makes organization increasingly complex and can, in some cases, eventually take away from the home-y or casual feel by requiring us to rent hotels and such, slowly but surely becoming like other medium-sized conventions.  That's cool, but it's important to realize that it's happening and shift your expectations along with the shifting changes.  After the first (second?) JiffyCon I went to, everyone went back to the Bakers' house and sat around talking until 11:00 or so at night.  Clearly, that can't really happen on the same scale anymore, which is partially why they've built in an extra day for Western Mass JiffyCons, just for hanging out.  How have other small cons adjusted to gradually becoming medium-sized cons?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215683/#Comment_215683" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T07:16:14+00:00" title="July  1, 2009  7:16AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2009 7:23AM by GB_Steve.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At SteveCon I did all the organisation including drumming up interest, soliciting GMs, organising the room which was free all but once and I paid for it. SteveCon is free to attend. I then greet people and organise games. Anyone coming from abroad got first pick and I tried to buy them a drink for their trouble. After that we all played one session. Then we ate, sometime in the pub, sometimes not. Not usually altogether but as games finished. Then we had another session.<br/><br/>I played games and didn't worry about things and it worked out fine except for once when someone got drunk and unpleasant. I should have made it clearer that people could come to me with their problems but given that it took about 10 SteveCons before we had a problem, I foolishly imagined that it wouldn't happen.<br/><br/>There hasn't been a SteveCon for a while now, mostly because of the proliferation of medium Cons in the UK. There just hasn't been a slot available. Also we started to suffer from apathy which was partly linked, I think, to it being free.<br/><br/>There was some discussion of SteveCon becoming bigger, and even the offer of sponsorship but it's a real step change if much money is involved.

Unfortunately that doesn't necessarily mean they are qualified for the job. I guess the answer is to make it a distributed function. <br/><br/>Game Camp in London was a self-organising con about gaming (mostly computer gamers). There was a grid with timeslots and locations and anyone who had anything to present just put a post-it on the grid and did what they liked. I talked about real choices and morals, Simon about indie games and Graham ran Poison'd. I imagine similar things can be done with responsibilities although there will always need to be an ultimate voice of reason.

We split official duties among the 3 of us at GPNW with a tight pre-arranged official schedule that everyone signed-off on of who was on duty during each slot to take care of business, who's responsibility it was to open/close, stay behind during breaks and meal times etc. This helped distribute the responsibility and didn't leave any one person holding the bag or force us to negotiate that on the fly which could be socially awkward while your friends are waiting for you. Little things like making sure the meal time person is brought food helps with this and gives a sense of team and we would all help each other out anyway regardless of whose official job it was.  Even when I wasn't on duty though, I (and I'm pretty sure Tony and Phil too) feel if our credo is to make everyone welcome to what could be an intimidating social scene and have a game to play, that means following through by maybe hanging back and running games when necessary and staying generally aware of the social situation rather than grabbing your group and dice and disappearing and we're more than happy to do that. FWIW, the vast majority of our attendees are pre-registered so we don't get a ton of walk-in traffic so while we were still always on the look out for walk-ins, I think other than the first night, we didn't feel it necessary to sit there doing nothing but wait to greet people.<br><br>EDIT: ** However, I will throw out a cautionary tale that could just be my particular pitfall that if it comes to the point when you're thinking more about running the event and less about playing games, you've gone too far and you need an intervention.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215715/#Comment_215715" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T09:24:45+00:00" title="July  1, 2009  9:24AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You make a good point Ping - maybe the real skill is finding the people who genuinely enjoy organizing and facilitating an event, and have a gift for making people feel at home and welcome, and putting them into those positions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215716/#Comment_215716" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T09:30:42+00:00" title="July  1, 2009  9:30AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Definitely. I think sometimes people volunteer out of obligation or overcommitment themselves when they're not really prepared or specifically interested in facilitating (I mean, we all probably know horror stories of people who like being in charge of things but aren't up to the responsibilities).  The best mini-cons definitely rest on the backs of people who 1) get social kicks out of making sure everyone else has a great time and 2) are good at organization and details.  Personally, I definitely get the former but can be flakey about the latter, so I need a person who keeps deadlines and tracks progress to back me up.  But on the day-of, I love being the guy who gets donuts and gets coffee going and makes sure everyone has a game and talks to people as they come in.  I'm just less good at managing sign-up and posting details about hotels and directions and making sure the room is reserved and stuff.  And you really need <i>both sets of skills</i> for a good con: pre-event detail management and on-the-ground detail management.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215729/#Comment_215729" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T10:04:28+00:00" title="July  1, 2009 10:04AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe this doesn't apply to what everyone here seems to be talking about, but I run a small house con once in a while.

I think for smallish (10-15 people) cons, you need to have GMs lined up to run things at specific times and you have to make sure you have a sufficient number of GMs for the attendees.<br><br>When you're talking 15 people attending, that's 2-3 GMs to entertain them for each slot.

Lets you prioritize your must-play spots with your bestest buds, while leaving a lot open for the slow ones.<br/><br/>I've seen a microcosm of this phenomenon with the monthly gamedays we've been organizing down at <a href="http://www.goplaypdx.com/forum/index.php?www" rel="nofollow">Go Play PDX</a>: we only have limited space, usually someone's <i>house</i> (i.e. mine), and everyone who's a regular forum-checker fills the slots for the, like, 2-3 games, and other folks start going, "well, i'd like to come but it looks like there's no room. . ." And the REAL losers in this scenario are the potential invites who aren't part of the forum community at ALL. When everyone's clumped up a week before the event, it makes it hard to invite friends and assure them they'll have fun.<br/><br/>I'll echo the dismayed feeling at seeing all the full signups. In fact, having the forum thread printouts <i>taped onto the signup sheet</i> seemed to REALLY rub it in. And though in my case I was a latecomer, I can also imagine a person coming to the event cold, invited by somebody no doubt, and finding a big wall in front of "things to do." Feels cliquish without (certainly) being intended that way.<br/><br/>HOWEVER: I will note that a ot of the "full-ness" turned out to be illusory. Not only was there plenty to do besides the full events, but a lot of times the <i>actual</i> playership varied from the listed signups. Though an illusion IS still a barrier. I was bold enough to ask Jason about sitting in on The Upgrade, and lucky enough that a couple of folks vacated their spots. but had I not been as assertive, I could've easily missed out. With the "group hug" corraling that Tony, Phil and Ping did, these things got sorted out right quick, and I got more at ease with the sitch as the weekend progressed and I saw things unfold.

Part of this was cause I wanted to have female Characters available, but not mandatory. When friends that I know BurningWheel showed up often they could just jump in. This was informal but happened often. Part of this was that I didn't feel conferrable explaing the rules for BurningWheel for more then 4 people. <br/><br/>However when I got 2 or 3 BurningWheel vets things rocked! they took part of the burden off of me. Then the game could handle 6 players. Everyone got spot light time, I spent less time explaining the rules. <br/><br/>I agree with Judd, part of this is play preferences.. and I if I am going to invest time into preping, even if that is just rereading the rules a few days before the Con, I need to know that my game will happen.<br/><br/>On the flip side of this, my first Camp Nerdly, last year, sucked hard. Well, only part of one day. I didn't fine anything that I wanted to play for one slot, and then my GM for the slot before got sick and left. So I had two open slots.. The schedule was such a mess that no one knew what was up. or what games where not full.. so I didn't find a game and I just took a walk in the woods... <br/><br/>This years schedule was handled much better.. In fact, Camp Nerdly recent experiment with gauging people's Interest in games was neat. It reflects something I have been wanting to building / toy with for sometime. I have ideas on how to make it better, and I would welcome others to share with me their ideas. Feedback is part of what is misses from pre-registertion systems. I don't know how much everyone really wants to play my games. Ranking games in how strongly they want to play may fix the over signing up problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

we've tried our best to make it as friendly as possible to people who don't partake in the online community. Which tends to be about 30% of the people who attend (friends, family, and people who just heard about the event locally).<br/><br/>In our specific situation we found that pre-registration was very unfriendly to new people.<br/><br/>And I wouldn't have guessed it but ordering pizza for everyone was a great way to get everyone socializing by simply eating a meal together.</blockquote>\nme and my vested interest...<br/><br/>John, not to nitpick the above but isn't NNYC primarily an online community with Recess and other events as outreach/social events with partial non-NNYC inclusion?  The turning point in this for me is that the arguments for/against day-of registration is critical depending on how that gets defined.  <br/><br/>If it is as i suggest, then pre-reg isn't that big of a deal for a majority of the community because they already interact with the community in an abstract format.  It won't solve the problem for the 20-30 friends and spouses that don't actively participate in NNYC but then they have spouses and friends that can pre-reg for them and guide them anyway.  <br/><br/>i think the food element is a big socializer at these events.

Many groups had already started gaming 10 minutes before the "Group Hug".<br/>People were chatting, trying to figure out their own thing.<br/><br/>Flash back to GP07.<br/>The "Group Hug" was something that EVERYONE showed up to, EVERYONE listened to, and EVERYONE took cues from.<br/>The final slots for every session weren't available for sign-up until just before the group meet, and the group meet would make sure those games were indeed full, run pitches for remaining games (and new contenders), take sign-ups, and sort everyone out.<br/><br/>No one ever gave Ping that buy-in, this year. I'm not sure what that was about.<br/>Well, I am.<br/>People wanted to maximize their "awesome" and so they pre-regged, they jumped into games at the first moment's opportunity, and they ignored the now-irrelevant-to-them "Group Hug". This is a fine way to do things, but its a fundamentally different con than GPNW07, and ultimately one I'm less interested in.

Camp Nerdly 0 - Everyone arriving at different times over the afternoon, giving plenty of time for socializing and casual gaming.<br/>2.) Gencon 06, Forge Booth - At the start of every day at the booth, we did a vocal warm-up. At the end of the day, we did a celebratory back-pat for our jobs well done.<br/>3.) Go Play NW 07 - We ate all of our meals together, in a cafeteria. Most people chose to sit in different groups every time.<br/>4.) Go Play NW 07 - Every session started with a group meet, where we pitched all of our options, signed up, and then dispersed<br/>5.) Go Play NW 07 - Linked to the last point, minimized pre-registration.<br/>6.) Go Play NW 08 - We had a friday night get-together at a restaurant. Also, in general, people went to meals in big groups.<br/>7.) Gamestorm 09 - A largely-spectated game of Sea Dracula (4 contestants, judge, bailiff and around 20 audience members) brought together the Indie Hurricane crowd at the end for one last hurrah.<br/>8.) Go Play NW 09 - The friday night feast worked brilliantly to bring people together well.<br/>9.) Go Play NW 09 - Having the beer/pop/water coolers was great for facilitating a club house/group of friends vibe.<br/>10.) Go Play NW 09 - The Group Hugs.<br/>11.) Weathertop 07/08 - Large games of Jungle Speed brought lots of people to the table in curiousity, and we got them in and playing quickly.

Why do you have to make me feel inferior?!<br/><br/>As someone who's quite shy until I get my social legs underneath me the big organized social stuff makes me feel really uncomfortable and I totally hate having it pushed on me. Group hugs? No way, don't touch me you weirdos. A lot of these ideas sound scary. But that's probably my problem - if some of these ideas were sprung on me at a con I already felt included at I would do my best to avoid them.<br/><br/>The thing that has helped me more than anything is people who are willing to approach me individually and socialize. Can this be socially engineered? I think "Assigning someone to look for people who are not in games and helping them get into games" comes closest to this. Having someone come over to me if I'm alone and looking confused to steer me towards a game or just BS with me about games for awhile would be a huge relief. Group meals is a real good way to just chill and listen to other people and get a feel for personalities, too. <br/><br/>It took me a few cons to feel "included" at Dexcon/Dreamation and the things that did it had more to do with cool individuals remembering me and acknowledging my existence than anything else. We could have group hugs, but if you're standing there talking with your friends and I'm shifting from foot to foot over here not sure what to do, I don't really feel included even if you had your hand on my butt fifteen minutes ago.<br/><br/>I think having a cadre of unnofficial lookouts keeping an eye out for people who are alone is a super-good bet. And don't stick a "Social Officer" badge on them because then it seems weird. Oh, you <i>have</i> to socialize with me. I see. Personally, I try to use my position as GM to keep an eye out for the quiet, alone types and engage them after the game and talk to them about how the con is going for them. That has worked pretty well for me.<br/><br/>Edit: I just thought about this a bunch, and looking back on cons and my friends' experiences at cons that I've taken them too, the thing that stands out to me as a measure of includedness is friendly faces and names to attach them to. When I think of the moments I felt included at cons where people knew each other and I knew nobody, it was having that person I could spot and recognize and have them be socially accessible to me. Looking back I notice this with my friends too. Say I have a conversation with Brennan Taylor and they hover around and I introduce everyone. Later I'll see them chatting with Brennan on their own because they know him, because he's awesome, and because he's a boothmonkey and is accessible for socialization. I think having people take on that job, to be accessible and maybe not playing games all the time, and being willing to approach new and lone faces, would go pretty far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216778/#Comment_216778" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T18:49:20+00:00" title="July  6, 2009  6:49PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>Group hugs?

The assembling and shouting method started to get a little unwieldly then. We did have preregistration for one of the cons but it didn't work very well. Not only did people change their minds once they got a better idea of what was on offer but less people offered to run games although we always had more prepped games than we had players to play them.<br/><br/>The only resentment we ever had from this system was one guy who prepped a game each time and no one wanted to play it, mostly it seemed because he could never describe it in a way that would attract other players. This was a shame because once I'd put the effort in to drag a decent description out of him, he had some good stuff.<br/><br/>I like prereg for LARPS where you need to have a large quorum to get the thing off the ground but in situations where there are lots of players and lots of games, I'd prefer the method Graham describes, it seems more friendly and inclusive and it's how I got to play Misery Bubblegum.</blockquote>\nI missed this, on the occasion I saw it he made a terrible pitch and spent ages, seriously ages, talking about how he was too drunk to understand the rules of the game he wanted to run.  I wasn't surprised nobody wanted to play.  <br/><br/>For me, I'd have liked Stevecon to become more explicitly indie, make it an opportunity to try out shit that you might take to or you might never want to play again, but that otherwise you might struggle to get an opportunity to try out.  It's not uncommon I think for one person in a gaming group to have more of an interest in story games than the rest of their group, or for their group to contain one or two people who hate the concept so those games don't get played.  Some also of course don't have an everyday group, particularly I suspect those who only like story games who then have to find three to five people with similar taste to get a game going.<br/><br/>Story games are niche.  I like historical rpgs, also niche.  If I wanted only to play historical rpgs, I'd struggle to get a group going, I imagine some story gamers are in precisely that boat.<br/><br/>I do think there's still a gap for a London based story games con, perhaps a quarterly one or something like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217112/#Comment_217112" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T22:15:11+00:00" title="July  7, 2009 10:15PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>I am NOT kissing any of you.</blockquote>\nThat's OK, you don't have to kiss <i>back.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217113/#Comment_217113" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T22:16:52+00:00" title="July  7, 2009 10:16PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>Is the group hugs thing serious?

In the UK we have/had assembly every morning, up to the age of 11 it included prayers which was odd for those of us not raised religious.  My secondary school was less gung ho about them, but often included anti-racist homilies of dubious efficacy ("all the white children put their hands up.  Ok, all the black children put their hands up".  I forget what the point was, but I do remember two of my friends querying which group they were supposed to belong to and feeling duly insulted.  There then followed a speech about how whites were the real coloured people, with their range of pinks, reds, etc.  The head meant well, but I think the message was perhaps a touch confused).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217419/#Comment_217419" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T05:15:00+00:00" title="July  9, 2009  5:15AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like what Bret Gillan says up there, and I feel the same way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217726/#Comment_217726" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-10T17:13:09+00:00" title="July 10, 2009  5:13PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>For me, I'd have liked Stevecon to become more explicitly indie, make it an opportunity to try out shit that you might take to or you might never want to play again, but that otherwise you might struggle to get an opportunity to try out. </blockquote>It was pretty much indie.
