You roll a bunch of dice, then assign these to various outcomes (e.g. Do I get hurt? Do I succeed? Does it cause trouble? and so on). If you get hurt, then you're impaired and, the next time you roll dice, you must throw one away. If you get hurt again, you must throw away your highest die when you roll. And so you become gradually less effective.<br/><br/>How would you hack Psi Run so that injuries enhanced the narrative?<br/><br/>(Note: Please don't defend Psi Run in this post! These threads can often descend into defensiveness and questioning. If you think the impairment rules <i>do</i> enhance the narrative, then take it somewhere else. I'm only interested in hacks.

I got the book off of the shelf before my last reply and head scratched a bit (great, now I have an itchy head) and then flicked through it looking for 'assist rules' because my first thought on singly impaired was bringing in a second runner in some way (a bit like Blood &amp; Waters mechanic where you can use someone else's dice to try and succeed but they take any negative consequences) then realised there wasn't a 'ganging up' option. Also noticed that healing impairments needed a further scene which gives the option to cause more impairments I guess (never a direction I like) having healing as part of the Harm track makes a lot of sense.<br/><br/>On the singly impaired idea - you either roll 1 less dice, or you take a different coloured dice to roll as the "I'm gifted" dice from another player who is willingly helping in some way and if you use that dice they take the consequences from it.

Single impairment takes away your best die, maybe (as for current double-impairment)? Or the die to take away is deliberately picked by the GM, after rolling. An option for doubly-impaired could be that dice have to be rolled in order, taking away player choice.<br/>\u2192 Making the table-cue for "impaired" more obvious. The small red token is obviously too easy to overlook!

I wonder if there is some way to combine these ideas?<br/><br/>If you want impairment to be just something which affects the roll, I would want it to be linked to something specific, I think. So, yeah, maybe taking head damage means you have to send your lowest die to Reveal. Or having a leg injury means you subtract 1 from whatever die you use for your Goal anytime you need to use your legs to achieve that Goal.<br/><br/>Perhaps by "colouring" the injury by relating to specific mechanics (as opposed to a generic "lose a die"), you could get this effect? John has a piece of glass through his arm, so he can't place his highest die in a category related to that. But Jim has a broken leg, which means he has to reroll whatever die he places in the Pursuit/Captured (I can't remember the terms) category and keep the lower result.<br/><br/>If you don't want to deal with the rolling bit, you'll have to add some injury/impairment effects which affect the fiction all the time. Maybe stuff like, "Ok, your glasses were broken in the fall. Without your glasses, you can't drive the car anymore." "You're bleeding so hard that if you use your psychic powers now, you'll pass out from the pain."<br/><br/>I'm not sure if you should have a list of stuff like this to choose from, or some other way to create these effects in play.<br/><br/>It also might be interesting if injuries/impairment didn't have purely negative effects, either, they just limited your options. Maybe getting injured means you have more trouble escaping from pursuit, but your psychic powers are more likely to go crazy and have "out of control" effects.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408712/#Comment_408712" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T05:44:55+00:00" title="March 11, 2013  5:44AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've pondered all of this a bit more and come to a decision, when I run it I'll be using the following for Impairment and I'll see how it goes- <br/><br/>When impaired, roll all available dice but the GM removes 1 die before allocation. (Thinking is that this still loses you a dice but allows the GM to colour the options a little rather than completely restricting them.)<br/><br/>When doubly impaired the GM selects either the highest die goes to Reveal or the lowest die goes to Psi (Thinking is that this can push the game along and the stresses of being impaired can go either way. Plus it gives the GM the option to avoid triggering memories and causing the end game, presuming a Psi die has been used.)<br/><br/>And finally putting a 6 on the Harm track denotes "Runner is healed, all current impairments go away." (Thinking, this just means you can choose to heal when you have the dice for it without taking up a scene with healing. I'd suggest if you want to make a scene the focus of healing then that is still an option and then healing would be easier.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408767/#Comment_408767" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T15:52:33+00:00" title="March 11, 2013  3:52PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A way to combine multiple ideas from this thread is to make a different Risk Sheet for the use of impaired Runners.
