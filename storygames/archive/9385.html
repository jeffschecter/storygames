Game elements for kept spinning round my head. I'm afraid the design bug is somewhat new to me, here is my disease:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Shape of Things to Come</b><br/>\nNear-future science fiction game [or rather, basic idea for one]<br/>\n<b>Premise:</b> Some world-changing event, new technology, new social structure or similar is going to come about in the near future. A group of people are chosen  by the potential for the new thing - Ie, the Fate of the yet-undetermined New World Order has chosen and empowered you to help make it real and make it good.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo start out, the group determines *together* what sort of Thing is coming about. Then, play somehow (conflicts?) lead the thing closer to reality, until it becomes real and the campaign ends. I have a basic sketch of a simple set of character traits, somewhat inspired by the previews of project Donut.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>System Fragments/ideas:</b><br/>\n<b>The Dream Clock:</b> For every significant attempt at shaping the Thing to Come that the players make, add either a Dream token or a Nightmare token to the Dream Clock. Each token is accompagnied by a short description of an aspect of the Thing which has now been determined. Nightmare must be bad, Dream must be (some version of) good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm gonna try to realize this thing. But if you got any ideas for inspiration or ways to approach it, i would be much obliged.<br/>\nAlso,more specifically, i'm trying to think of a way to determine when to increase the dream clock (with either Nightmare or Dreams) that doesnt reduce to GM fiat.<br/>\nSomeone in the game is probably gonna come up with something that will bring it closer to being real, which will end with some conflicts. then someone has to decide whether that increases the clock, and whether it's a Nightmare or Dream. The problem is to reduce the complex in-game situation to a binary result without it breaking the fun, or at least, i suspect it will be.<br/>\n<br/>\n(i might actually also be posting here as a kind of commitment to myself to try to finish this thing)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
