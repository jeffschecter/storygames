Been thinking about having a blog for talking about my game design ideas and decisions, but it actually took my wife to set it up for me on her website (big kiss to her). I've been working on this game for aeons. It has evolved a lot as I've become more aware of indie game design and as a result from playtestings, but the writing is mostly done now and I just need to playtest (more), edit (more) and acquire some suitably inspiring art.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you leave any comments about what you think, good or bad (but constructive) I will be a happy puppy.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
