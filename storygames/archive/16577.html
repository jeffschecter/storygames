"Freeform"ish games.<br/><br/>I don't play those, and I'm not sure why. If you don't play them, either, let's find out why!<br/><br/>I think, for me, there are two things going on:<br/>1. Fixed canon. I like Star Wars, for instance, but not enough to want to just recreate it. I want new stuff. <br/>2. I don't see any experimenting with the form. This is probably 100% due to ignorance, but to me, forum roleplaying looks like it's pretty much just posting stuff in character and nothing else happens.<br/><br/>(I've played other forum games - like Lexicon, which was GREAT, but took forever).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379420/#Comment_379420" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T04:28:43+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  4:28AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now I sort of want to try a New &amp; Different forum game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379421/#Comment_379421" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T04:29:18+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  4:29AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A have a bunch of fantastic roleplaying experiences role playing in a forum like chat structure. Actually having the posts disappear quickly so all roleplaying had to be done in real time was very important although taking 10 minutes to write a decent post made for very slow play that was extra painful having a dial up modem and a loud keyboard. I stopped at first because my characters completed their arcs and became boring to play (the outlaw became an honest laborer and the wimpy bard became a jaded bard) and didn't pick it up because of the long play time required and the inconsistency of finding good people to play against.<br/><br/>Another point against it was that I got to know a few of the people behind the characters and that also killed it for me, having a face and a name behind a character just made me imagine them typing instead of some ghost producing the ego of the characters. Also not knowing how someone would react to something made waiting several minutes for the answer post more exciting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379426/#Comment_379426" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T04:58:20+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  4:58AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used to spend a lot of time role-playing on message boards and chat rooms. <br/><br/>The biggest reason I don't do play by post much anymore is time. Interactions between characters take a long time, particularly compared to playing face to face, by skype or in a chat room. And since players are often on different schedules, threads can take days or weeks or months to play out. Many times this leads people to abandon or forget about a thread before the story has been resolved. In fact, I think I've only played one play-by-post storyline all the way to a satisfying conclusion, ever.<br/><br/>And then, of course, there are the times when you're the distracted one, and you return to the thread after a day or two of absence to find that two or three players made four pages of posts and the storyline is in a totally different place than where you left it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379430/#Comment_379430" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T05:29:00+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  5:29AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2012 5:29AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>If you don't play them, either, let's find out why!</blockquote>\nHonestly, I just don't care to maintain the level of social obligation that goes along with participating in one of those games.

I can only really keep 2 games going at once.  More than that and I just don't remember where I left off in which game and they compete with each other for my break time.<br/><br/>That said, I've really enjoyed play by forum games.  It's gaming that I can do during my lunch hour and doesn't take away from family time (I don't have a face-face group or a spouse that plays RPGs).  Some games lend themselves to PbF, others very much do not.  I've had great luck with Lady Blackbird (and two hacks thereof),  Apocalypse World, Dungeon World, Ghost/Echo, and Murderous Ghosts.  Basically, systems where one roll allows you to advance the story and players have authority to drive the plot.  Any back and forth with dice (for example D&amp;D combat) or mother-may-I with the GM makes games really unsuited for PbF.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379470/#Comment_379470" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T08:16:43+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  8:16AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used to play them (and had fun) in college. <br/><br/>I don't anymore because:<br/><br/>- it's slow (slower than tactical RPG combat)<br/>- it feels isolating, I'm extroverted and would rather interact with people in person<br/>- often the person who knows the most canon has an edge<br/>- it can be very political (lots of behind the scenes plotting)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379472/#Comment_379472" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T08:28:06+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  8:28AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, I already play in person enough that I don't really need to play forum games. <br/><br/>But in situations in the past where I haven't been face-to-face gaming as much as I'd have liked I still didn't do forum gaming.

People are enthusiastic in the beginning but very nearly every forum game slowly dies away before the story is finished. I only ever finished one, where I was GM'ing and holding it together with a personal effort.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) People not paying fricking attention. Too many contradictions with what others have written before. (In the games I GM'ed I played watchdog and there was a LOT of OT discussion and editing going on, but it's tiresome.)<br/>\n<br/>\n3) People rushing ahead with chat-style posts and finishing entire scenes without other players whose characters were also present getting a single post in. (Again, in the games I GM'ed I played watchdog.)<br/>\n<br/>\n4) People losing momentum, writing only one small detail or one dialogue line per post, which is fine every once in a while but if they go on like that for the entire scene, it just takes forever.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) People not contributing to the story, not taking the game anywhere, just tugging along (actually not a problem particular to forum games).<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Flawed formats. For example, the open forum game where there is one thread per location, so each location has its own timeline and it's really very hard to keep track. Or the one where players have no narrative control whatsoever and need to run everything past the GM as a "can I" question that slows the game down incredibly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that said, I had some great times in forum games and have never quite given up on the idea of <i>making it work next time</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd" title="Jon_Shepherd"><img alt="Jon_Shepherd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/nFIK1HGFYHAN0.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd">Jon_Shepherd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379489/#Comment_379489" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T09:36:47+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  9:36AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually don't mind the speed at all.

I've made attempts to instate a sort of employment/election process in choosing players and GMs based on how they've played in other games, but they were ultimately unsuccessful.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379492/#Comment_379492" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T09:56:19+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  9:56AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>If you don't play them, either, let's find out why!</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Same reasons I don't read fanfiction: I'm not enough of a "fan" of anything.</li>\n</ul>\nplus\n<ul>\n<li>Same reasons I don't play MMORPGs: I like the eye contact, the physical-person interactions and the shared drinks.</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd" title="Jon_Shepherd"><img alt="Jon_Shepherd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/nFIK1HGFYHAN0.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd">Jon_Shepherd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379494/#Comment_379494" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T10:03:58+00:00" title="May 23, 2012 10:03AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, concerning PbF roleplays set in an established universe: A lot of them aren't about "recreating" the source material as they are about exploring what the original didn't, asking what-ifs, and interacting with/expanding the canon in cool ways.

Many forum games I've known, in particular the "open" GM-less ones, were actually just an excuse to write fan fiction that other people would actually (sometimes) read. There was a lot of navel-gazing and mary-sue-ism going on, and not so much collaborative storytelling really. The good ones are more interactive but still, it's all about having fun writing prose. Forum games are not really trying to substitute table-top gaming and face-to-face interaction, at least not the ones I've known. Sure, Google hangouts can do that much better.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut! Forum games, if done well, allow hobby writers to flex their writing muscle and share some prose, and to collaborate with others in a fun way. The problem seems to be that most participants don't care so much about others. And also, in most forum games and especially the large ones, many participants are very poor writers indeed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379743/#Comment_379743" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-25T08:47:13+00:00" title="May 25, 2012  8:47AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me clarify that I didn't mean to use "fanfiction" as a derogatory term!

In the same way, and for the  reasons some stories make better books then movies. And vise versa. <br/><br/>Some forms/aspects of roleplay is better expressed in text then verbally or trough body language. Subtle use of language, easy shift between other actions an the character inner life you can do that with monologues, but it often done more neatly and subtly in text, you can sneak in thought in a phrase, word choice or in half a sentence, without the reader getting confused. You can get to see all the different angles of the same scene at the same times, trough different pair of eyes. <br/><br/>You can have the luxury of time, in in-person role play media, you can't keep other people waiting to long to receive a reply. In text roleplay you can have the luxery of time. To go and dwell on what you character would do for hours, and then take the time ro write a perfect reply. Or you can play as fast as you would like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380132/#Comment_380132" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-29T18:20:34+00:00" title="May 29, 2012  6:20PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: rabalias</cite>- Rabalias posts<br/>- Rabalias hits refresh<br/>- Rabalias hits refresh<br/>- *repeat*<br/><br/>...on one day, but then the very next day some other poor schmoe was doing the same thing waiting for me to post.</blockquote>\nThe secret to sucess there is to chose a forum that sends you e-mail when a thread is updated.<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_380261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380261/#Comment_380261" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-30T15:20:57+00:00" title="May 30, 2012  3:20PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like them.<br/>I do not play them, at least not often.<br/><br/>That being due to most PbF-games being ...<br/>- uninteresting<br/>- uninventive<br/>- invisible<br/><br/>And due to players ...<br/>- being immature<br/>- not paying attention<br/>- being too emotional<br/>- not following up on the commitment<br/><br/>Not a big problem, though; there are so many other games to play!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
