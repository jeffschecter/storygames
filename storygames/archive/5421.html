Saddle-stitched books are normally bound with two staples, right?<br/>2. What if I took a big paper-cutter and sliced a 6x9" standard book in half, horizontally?<br/>3. Would that create two 6x4.5" books?<br/>4. Would one staple hold each of the two resulting booklets together?<br/>5. Are the staples spaced in such a way that they would be in the middle of the booklets' spines?  Or would they be really off-sided?<br/><br/>Anybody have any saddle-stitched 6x9" books from Lulu that they can send me pics of?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121544/#Comment_121544" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-23T13:50:22+00:00" title="January 23, 2008  1:50PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So Ben is like "You're an idiot.
