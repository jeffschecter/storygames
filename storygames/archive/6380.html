I thought I'd throw it out there for comment and feedback to see where it goes.  This is nothing more than a, "what do you think?" thread.<br/><br/>I admit I really dislike fannish discussions about "canon" when it comes to fantasy (or any other) fiction.  I hate the discussions about how/why this or that works "in the world" or "what if" games.  If a fantasy world has a "rule" I'm the first to want to break it.  Consider World of Warcraft with its technologically advanced gnomes who can not be Priests or Paladins.  The first thing I WANT to be is a Gnome Paladin who has turned to faith forsaking technology, especially in light of the destruction of their home city in the wake of a technological disaster.  That goes double for the Undead who have had their connection to life and nature severed.  All I want to do is play an Undead Druid who, through shear force of will, has, with great desperation, grasped back that connection.<br/><br/>So, in retaliation for my inability to have this need serviced through other games I imagined a game called "Exceptional Fantasy."  (Do you see where I'm going with this?)  Basically it's core mechanism works like this:  First, there would be some mechanism where by "rules of the world" could be added to a list called The Canon.  So you would end up with a list of things like:<br/><br/>Vampires can not walk in sunlight.<br/>Magic requires human sacrifices.<br/>Nobles only ever marry other nobles.<br/><br/>And so on....<br/><br/>Then there would be another set of mechanics that would allow you to BREAK the rules in The Canon.  In fact, it would be mandatory that during character creation your character breaks one of the rules.  So the whole game would be about establishing "rules" and then exploring situations which break those "rules" because it always seems to me that the interesting choices and situations to explore always lie on those boundary conditions.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule" title="GeekGirlsRule"><img alt="GeekGirlsRule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule">GeekGirlsRule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141133/#Comment_141133" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T12:35:34+00:00" title="April 24, 2008 12:35PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really wish I were coherent to post more than just, "that sounds neat."

So I'm going to add "Wizards can not wear armor because metal interferes with the channeling of natural energies."<br/><br/>So I imagine a metal mage who has unearthed new, previously unknown magical properties of metal itself.  Rune covered swords and armor.  That kind of thing.<br/><br/>And while this game is easiest to play with character ideas I imagine it working mid-play.  For example, "Magic requires religious artifacts to work" is on The Canon.  Then comes a scene where the villain totally has the hero cornered.  The villain chortles, "I've taken away your holy symbol priest, there's no hope for you now."

I think a great tradition to fantasy, and modern horror, and many other types of stories - especially as they appear in RPGs.<br/><br/>D&amp;D novels are especially rife. You have the half-elf who grew a beard, rejecting the culture of his elven foster parents. The dark elf who fights against his people for the forces of good.<br/><br/>The problem is, these can become exceptional cliches, which destroy any reason to break the canon in the first place.<br/><br/>Having a mechanic that tells you your job is to break the canon, I think will help keep them unique - especially if each time you make character you have a new set of canon - which doesn't mean you have to have a new setting.  "Elves are cultured, refined and enlightened" doesn't have to conflict with "Elves embrace the inherent magic of nature", it only sets a different facet of canon to break. In a sense, you display what is important about the setting by playing with contrasting elements.<br/><br/>And taking it beyond character, in play, does work like Keys, in that it forces change to occur in the campaign world.  Does the priest using magic without his holy symbol now mean there's a paradigm change in magic? Or is he special somehow?  Either way you answer it, makes for <i>another</i> interesting story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141192/#Comment_141192" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T16:44:31+00:00" title="April 24, 2008  4:44PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite><br/>Jesse, could you unpack this a bit? What is it about canon-rules that makes you want to break them?</blockquote>\nThere are so many answers to that question.  Some of it is a form of intellectual spite.  The failure of fans to realize that "canonical rules" are a function of authorial history and not a place that "is" being "revealed" by the author.  Worse, the fact that some publishers and authors basically pander to that mentality and in fact *are* "revealing" a "world" and its "rules" and thus hamstringing themselves as artists.  Gamer culture in some circles is particularly entrenched in this.  Players who can not conceive of making up their own setting because "world building" is too much effort.  I can't tell you how many times in the past I've been told by a GM of a pick-up con game I was in that I played the character wrong because such-and-such *made up thing* "isn't like that."<br/><br/>More practically I view such rules as character positioning devices.  Characters who somehow break the "rules" of their universe usually present an interesting situation to confront.  The Undead Druid who fights for his connection to nature... what makes him so driven?  Why is it THAT important to him?  What do his fellow undead think of him?  How do they treat him?  Is he a god among his people or an outcast?<br/><br/>Similarly when such "rules" are broken mid-story it usually serves as a massive thematic highlighter on the real world things at stake.  It's a giant metaphorical wake up call to the audience saying: Hey!  This story, it's about THIS right here.  Pay attention.<br/><br/>Note: I also think that when characters *conform* to the rules can be equally as thematically telling.  Which is why if I were to flesh out this mechanic I think there would be certain benefits from conforming to the The Canon as well.  So, yes, setting level Keys basically.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule" title="GeekGirlsRule"><img alt="GeekGirlsRule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule">GeekGirlsRule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141195/#Comment_141195" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T16:50:43+00:00" title="April 24, 2008  4:50PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree to an extent, but I think it's also fun to try to conform to those "canonical" rules.

I think this is a flawwed premise. Well, at least I don't think I'd be interested. <br/>\n<br/>\nLooking at your reasons illuminates one of the problems I have: I don't want to play out of intellectual spite. That is, despite having had some of the problems that you have had with the sort of play in question, I understand and accept the reasonings for why players want to play this way. That's not to say that it can't be abused, of course. But simply that it's abuse doesn't make the vector any less valid. It would only be so if, in fact, you couldn't have fun with it sans abuse. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reasons you give for why people play this way, are only the bad ones that may exist, and ignore the good ones that might exist. At best, you're talking a preference here. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut even if it's your preference, sans a need to rebel against some phenomenon, I can't see being forced into playing an exception as being particularly fun. In fact, the reason I like it when players play exceptional characters, is that they've made the choice to play such a character, when they could have chosen not to. And, further, I actually also appreciate the well-played stereotype, too. That is, one that has it's assumptions challenged, and still comes down on the same side. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what makes Conan an attractive character. He is archtypal, and, despite his beliefs and such being challenged again and again, he always emerges as Conan. That, too, is fascinating. What's dull, I'd agree, is when we don't explore this stuff at all. But forcing one answer or another takes away player creativity. What if that gnome suddenly finds a piece of really important technology, one that could put Gnomeregan back together again? Now we have a real question, one that's only really a question if there's the possibility that the gnome decides to use the technology, and not destroy it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141272/#Comment_141272" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T09:09:30+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  9:09AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>I think over time, "rules" on The Canon would build up more weight the longer they go unbroken.

On that basis, you would probably dismiss most of my creative endeavors as my own personal dissatisfaction or anger with certain creative trends in the world is probably one of my most common motivators.  Are we talking preferences?  Of course.  I just don't mind owning up to and being loud about mine.  So when asked why, I'm not afraid of telling the truth: this particular idea was born of intellectual spite, deserved or undeserved.<br/><br/>And man if I want to tread on REALLY dangerous ground I *think* I might even be talking about Ron's "prosthetics" idea from the infamous Brain Damage thread.  But I don't purport to full 100% understand his original argument so I could be wrong.<br/><br/>But my personal emotions aside I think it has legs on the more practical basis I've outlined.  For example you mention the gnome who stumbles across a piece of technology that could save Gnomeregon.  Dude, that's EXACTLY the kind of situation I would put in front of the Gnome Paladin in play.  That situation you've posed is EXACTLY what I want the game to be about.  But that question would ONLY be interesting if the character had a reason for being tempted to reject the technology in the first place.<br/><br/>Josh, yes, from where I'm standing you're just restating what I meant when I said, "garnering more thematic significance when it is broken."<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141306/#Comment_141306" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T12:16:26+00:00" title="April 25, 2008 12:16PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess that the concept seems to me to be more than just "born of" but "intended to spread the word of the spite."

This boundary for male athletes that no one thought could be crossed. They'd get a guy run four minutes and a few seconds, and people would be thinking that if he couldn't do it, and he's in better shape than anyone else we've seen before, then it must be physically impossible to do it. And of course about ten years later Bannister shows up and breaks the record. Followed by lots of people doing it. And eventually leading to current times where it is expected that middle distance male runners will be running an under four minute mile.<br/><br/>Mechanically, and probably because I just read Shock: last night, I think of Minutia. The presence of Minutia influences conflicts (which could be the mechanical reason for wanting the Canon to exist), and the way they're arranged on the table, all these little bits of paper with rules on them, I can easily see someone reaching over, picking one up, and ripping it in two to symbolize breaking the Canon. So your Priest character's player, their character trapped without their religious icon, reaches over to the card with "Magic only works with religious icons in hand" and rips it up before the character casts their spell.<br/><br/>Of course the other thing I think of is this: if in 1922 someone said nobody can run a four minute mile, and then some clown off the street goes and does it, I'm not particularly surprised, impressed, or whatever, I'm relatively unaffected. However, if it's another 30 years before anyone does, then it freaks me out and people fifty years after that still refer to it as one of the greatest moments in athletic history.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141314/#Comment_141314" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T12:49:13+00:00" title="April 25, 2008 12:49PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2008 12:49PM by Jogesh EZ.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            cross posted with chearns...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>This is what makes Conan an attractive character. He is archtypal, and, despite his beliefs and such being challenged again and again, he always emerges as Conan. That, too, is fascinating. What's dull, I'd agree, is when we don't explore this stuff at all. But forcing one answer or another takes away player creativity. What if that gnome suddenly finds a piece of really important technology, one that could put Gnomeregan back together again? Now we have a real question, one that's only really a question if there's the possibility that the gnome decides to use the technology, and not destroy it.</blockquote>\nI'll go back to my point that most of speculative fiction is about exceptional characters, Conan is a good example.  He's a barbarian who's destined to rule a civilized nation (even ignoring the canon breaks that his race is one of noble barbarians, not lawless savages, and civilization is the threat to a good honest life) and has left his home to wander the more civilized nations. In fact, in the very first story, he is already king and fustrated that his natural talents are of little use in fighting the politics of rulership (either he's a canon breaking king or a canon breaking barbarian).<br/><br/>Although maybe not every story is about his exception to the norm, a specific game doesn't have to be about every story.<br/><br/>To be a bit more constructive, though, this brings something to light. Does the break in canon need to occur in the beginning of the story?  Or perhaps might it start in media res (like the first Conan story starts really late in his life, if you add up the other stories) with flashbacks? There's a lot of power from the breaking of canon, so what about starting firmly enmeshed, without exception, and breaking it only during play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141322/#Comment_141322" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T13:32:43+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  1:32PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br/>\n  I like this idea. I think there should be two completely different rules though:<br/>\n1) My character is the exception to an established rule<br/>\n2) The rule is broken for everyone.<br/>\n  And that they should follow different mechanics. In other words, in your religious relic example. It is not clear whether our hero has learned some technique that lets him magick without a relic or if that law was never really real, but just self-imposed by superstitious priests, see what I mean?<br/>\n  Also, I think that there is some value in requiring the players to break a rule that they didn't create at char gen. In other words, Dave make a Rule, Mike makes a rule and Dave can make a char that breaks Mike's rule, but not his own...<br/>\n  And maybe that is the way the Canon works, in order to break a rule, you have to add a new rule. Like in order to break the Relic rule, you have to add a rule that states "Princesses can only marry for love" or something.<br/>\n  And I think what Mike is saying and what some other people probably also feel is that, to really rail against a perceived weakness in other game designs, we need to make the players' choices more free and more meaningful. It sounds like you are close to that, but I guess to allay any fears, we need to not lose track of that design goal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141348/#Comment_141348" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-26T02:05:24+00:00" title="April 26, 2008  2:05AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave M makes a good point.<br/><br/>When your character breaks the canon in some way (the priest works miracles without his relic), I think it would be most interesting if everyone (including the priest and his player) was in suspense about whether the rule was being broken for good and for everyone, or if this was some sort of weird anomaly.<br/><br/>I could see that leading to fun play: you break some important rule ("the dead cannot be brought back to this world") to bring your love back to Earth, hoping that this will be the end of it all. However, if the dice fall the wrong way (or whatever), then you might find yourself facing enemies you had defeated and killed long ago.<br/><br/>That sounds like a fun mechanic, and an interesting gamble.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
