I don't need it, I probably won't read it, I almost certainly won't play or use it. I already have far more "content" than I'll get through in a dozen lifetimes. I'd literally rather you didn't have it than you did. I don't want content; I <i>play</i> to make content. That's basically the point.<br/><br/>What you can do for me, as a game designer, is playtest your rules and make them perfect. That's what I want to pay for. That's why I use published games.<br/><br/>So, how about making your next stretch goal - "After the first PDF release, we'll take six months and $10K consultancy budget to really batter the game in play and through modelling and iron out the kinks."<br/><br/>If you can name your paid consultants ("Baker's agreed to run ten sessions on video, Crane will build 50 PCs in a hunt for dominant builds, and McDaldno has promised to find eleven serious ambiguities in the text") then I'll raise my pledge for sure.<br/><br/>How about it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406980/#Comment_406980" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-23T02:29:11+00:00" title="February 23, 2013  2:29AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're suggesting this as one idea among hundreds, a new spin on how one can think about kickstarter and rewards: neat. i bet it would work for some people (especially those who for some reason don't do all their playtesting before Kickstarter launch).<br/><br/>If you're suggesting that this is how kickstarters ought to go: ugh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406981/#Comment_406981" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-23T02:33:07+00:00" title="February 23, 2013  2:33AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2013 3:38AM by catty_big.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting. I'm considering doing something similar with my games, which is to bring out a v0, which will be a playable version of the game after as much playtesting as I've been able to achieve, which, given that I'm not a 'name', will be oodles of open and closed alpha (own group and folks on the con scene who know me) and maybe one or two blind playtests, sell it at almost cost, re-work the game in response to feedback from folks who've bought v0, then about six months later bring out v1. As for getting paid consultants such as Joe or Vincent, I doubt I'd be able to raise that much from a Kickstarter. Others might, who knows.

I don't really see where Durance needed anything more done to it. Lots of games go to Kickstarter when they're finished, that's part of the pitch.<br/><br/>I do loathe stretch goals, but they're part and parcel with the crowdfunding thing. The driving force of a Kickstarter campaign is excitement, saying "if you give us more money it'll be better in some yet-to-be-determined ways 6 months from now!" is hardly going to get people excited.<br/><br/>There are lots of things stretch goals can do that are not rushed supplements. Or, like Dungeon World, you can give the supplement its own timeline.<br/><br/>As far as playing to make content: ideally the supplement knows that and works towards it. For DW we're in the early stages of supplement planning now and we're definitely more geared towards "stuff the helps you make stuff" over the typical avalanche of monsters and classed and items (though there will be some of those too).<br/><br/>I'm all for rethinking stretch goals\u2014they're a complete pain to manage and might not be the best way to drive excitement\u2014but I'm not sure this is the way to do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406983/#Comment_406983" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-23T02:48:29+00:00" title="February 23, 2013  2:48AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If you're suggesting that this is how kickstarters ought to go: ugh.</blockquote>\nIf you're designing entirely for me, then certainly!<br/><br/>You <i>are </i>all designing for me, right?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406984/#Comment_406984" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-23T03:25:57+00:00" title="February 23, 2013  3:25AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I read this bit of "stretch goal" in a Kickstarter, then they wouldn't receive any of my money.

They mentioned a few cases in the testing phase where numerous people would complain about some flaw, but deeper examination revealed no problem (or a different one).<br/><br/>For example, many players were complaining that the reload times were too long, although they were as fast as or faster than most other FPS. However, when more animation steps were added to reloading (giving the illusion that more was actively happening), these complaints dwindled.<br/><br/>Furthermore, many times a playtester's feedback can reflect only their own (sometimes very specific) tastes and opinions. Player A can say X is too strong and Y needs to be improved; player B will say Y is too strong and X needs to be improved. And this can go on over many people, leading to a confused, bland, or simply dysfunctional system in the goal of pleasing everyone.<br/><br/>Now, this isn't to say playtesting isn't good in some ways, but it requires careful consideration and a steady hand.<br/><br/>TL;DR: Playtest feedback can be contradictory, subjective, and even plain wrong. Be careful!<br/><br/>- Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407021/#Comment_407021" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-23T11:32:32+00:00" title="February 23, 2013 11:32AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>I'll drop my general point here: with those things I can define criteria that is a non-subjective as anything in the world.

They do need better design.</blockquote>\nWell, speaking personally, I put as much energy and thought into designing games as I can. I engage as big a community as I have in playtesting. I handle as much critique as my little heart can bear. (Critique isn't a neutral endeavor. Critique is an emotional journey that you give up the reigns for.) There is a balancing act that I feel like I need to strike, as far as when to start going to press. I need to do it while I've still got enough energy to pour another 3-6 months of my life into the game, because that's how long editing/layout/funding/printing/mailing/promoting takes.<br/><br/>Designing games, thinking about new terrain, crafting mechanics? That stuff is fun and compelling and invigorating. Tweaking, editing, re-thinking, re-writing? That stuff is way harder and more draining. Throwing money at it won't necessarily make it more awesome. Throwing more time at it won't necessarily make it more awesome. Sage talks about why.<br/><br/>I guess I'm just really having trouble reading your comments charitably. I can't imagine where in the late-development process there would be space for an extra six months of refinement, without killing the project, and so I'm internalizing your words as an attack. That's my issue. But it's definitely coming up for me.<br/><br/>I don't speak for all designers. But I definitely know that I'm not the only one for who a number of these things are true: design is engaging and exciting, development is hard and treacherous, playtesting has its limits, projects need to move forward or else they'll die out along the way, at some point you need to make a choice about releasing or shelving.<br/><br/>If folks have less community support, their development process is going to be less informed and their playtesting crew much more limited. I think the thing that is going to be way more helpful in most cases than $10,000 of consultancy will be people making an effort to spot fledgling designers and playtest their stuff, and talk to them about their stuff over skype, and to ask questions like, "So, what other designs are you working on? What's their biggest departure from this one?" Single person design teams are the norm here, and they have limits. The support doesn't need to enter the picture when the game is essentially done. The support needs to come early and stay throughout.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407050/#Comment_407050" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-23T16:14:34+00:00" title="February 23, 2013  4:14PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So...I feel like the original post made a great point in a bad way.<br/><br/>If the point is: games need playtesting, I totally agree.

As always, I think <a href="/forums/profile/McDaldno">@McDaldno</a> really nails it when he says:\n<blockquote>I don't speak for all designers. But I definitely know that I'm not the only one for who a number of these things are true: design is engaging and exciting, development is hard and treacherous, playtesting has its limits, projects need to move forward or else they'll die out along the way, at some point you need to make a choice about releasing or shelving.</blockquote>\nA million +1s to that. All of this stuff (the design, the playtests, the development) happens as part of our ordinary lives, with the excitement and chaos and frustration that any project brings to our personal time. I think focusing on any one part of it (like playtesting) misses how the whole thing is an organic process.<br/><br/>That said, I also really agree with <a href="/forums/profile/Graham">@Graham</a> that playtesting is deeply useful. I playtested Our Last Best Hope a ton more than my first game primarily because I saw how other people were using playtesting to improve their designs in meaningful ways. It made a huge difference, and when I watch people play the game now, I'm really proud of the times where I was able to listen to that critique and make a change to the rules that made the game better.<br/><br/>I really think this is the kind of stretch goal that won't attract the right kind of attention. It's divisive, raises a lot of questions, etc. It's tough to get people to buy in to a delay of the product when they feel like you should have done this work already.<br/><br/>But I'd love to hear more suggestions from folks about how to approach this kind of idea, though. I think there's room to promote a culture of evaluation and reflection (instead of "testing") that will make all the games we design and play better. I think calling it "testing" is a bit of a problem, and I think we should try to move past that and really think about expanding the reflective nature of the design process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407134/#Comment_407134" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-24T19:26:38+00:00" title="February 24, 2013  7:26PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.

Playtesting is more expansive in purpose than what Ben talks about in his inflammatorily-worded essay. But in order to make playtesting sing for you as a designer, you need to know what you're looking for and create a playtest arrangement where you'll actually receive that. Creating a workable draft and then getting people to play it and "see how it goes" will not necessarily improve your game. But I'm hard-pressed to imagine a game that wouldn't benefit from playtesting. The key is to playtest smarter and with more intent. As a community of designers and players, we'll do well to keep sharing our best practices and ideas about how to playtest and what to watch out for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407148/#Comment_407148" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-24T23:02:20+00:00" title="February 24, 2013 11:02PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've actually found intent-less playtesting useful, but I think it varies from game to game.<br/><br/>For DW instead of asking for playtesters we made the game free (in one form) and told anybody who played it and shared their thoughts they'd get the whole game.<br/><br/>That actually worked really well for us, because instead of people playing with the intent of testing something, they were just playing. We got our feedback, including things we couldn't have expected like actual play recordings.<br/><br/>We also built up a publicly visible collection of feedack, which helped attract more people to the game.<br/><br/>So it worked for us, and I have a hard time imagining a more directed playtest meeting our goals so well, but it certainly doesn't apply to all games.

Our internal testing was much better about helping with the few fundamental issues we had, but told us nothing about how other people would or wouldn't react to them and how they'd understand them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407156/#Comment_407156" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-24T23:47:44+00:00" title="February 24, 2013 11:47PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So in summary: our method of "playtesting" (really playing the game and encouraging undirected feedback) worked wonderfully for us, for this game, but might not work for others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407158/#Comment_407158" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-25T00:05:28+00:00" title="February 25, 2013 12:05AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>As a community of designers and players, we'll do well to keep sharing our best practices and ideas about how to playtest and what to watch out for.</blockquote>\nI have a <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2012/07/05/some-rules-for-developing-and-playtesting-tabletop-rpgs/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> where I tried to distill what I consider some good practices for game development and playtesting based on my experience in computer hardware and software design and development, my efforts to design some games, and my experiences playtesting RPGs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407206/#Comment_407206" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-25T11:10:02+00:00" title="February 25, 2013 11:10AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Theory:<br/><br/>Playtesting can provide lots of different things. Playtesting is more expansive in purpose than what Ben talks about in his inflammatorily-worded essay. But in order to make playtesting sing for you as a designer, you need to know what you're looking for and create a playtest arrangement where you'll actually receive that. Creating a workable draft and then getting people to play it and "see how it goes" will not necessarily improve your game. But I'm hard-pressed to imagine a game that wouldn't benefit from playtesting. The key is to playtest smarter and with more intent. As a community of designers and players, we'll do well to keep sharing our best practices and ideas about how to playtest and what to watch out for.</blockquote>\nI can get behind this. I think it's pretty much in line with what Ben says, but I'd like to hear what you mean by "more expansive"--where and how?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
