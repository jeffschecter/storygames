It's like <i>Dead Like Me</i>, but with the aesthetic style of the Professor Layton games or <i>The Triplets of Belleville</i>.  I want some other people to try out the character creation rules to see if they work for anyone other than me.  I'm wondering how much variety you can get out of the initial seed content, and whether the initial statements are effective for creating new characters.  So if you could help me out a bit, try the process and provide some feedback, then that would be great.<br/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://nickwedig.libraryofhighmoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/death-takes-a-holiday-791x1024.jpg"/><br/><br/><br/>You play one of the Boxmullers, a family of distant relatives, who died in a boat crash en route to Perdido Island.  Instead of passing on to the afterlife, though, your characters are offered a deal by the Grim Reaper Himself.  Death is tired, and would desperately like to take a vacation from His job.  If you'll cover for Him while He is away, Death will let you live.  We'll assume you took the deal (this isn't Traveller or anything.)  So now the Boxmullers will act as substitute Reapers for Perdido Island while Death is away.<br/><br/>Each of your characters is made by going down a list of statements, and responding to each with a specific response.  Each statement needs a response, and each response can only be used once.  Several responses (<b>"Yes and\u2026", "Yes, but\u2026", "No and\u2026",</b> and <b>"No, but\u2026"</b>) just list the start of a statement.  You'll need to fill in additional detail after these.  <b>"But only if\u2026"</b> means that another player gets to suggest a detail there, which you can accept as true or reject the entire statement.  <b>"That's a funny story actually"</b> means that it will be a plotline developed in play.  <b>"Let's try that a different way"</b> means that the basic idea is true, but the specific details are different.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your starting Boxmuller:</span></b>\n<ul>\n<li>has been granted the ability to know how someone will die, just by looking at them<br/></li><li>has been granted the ability to see spirits and ghosts<br/></li><li>has fond childhood memories of vacationing on Perdido Island<br/></li><li>has few ties back to the mainland<br/></li><li>has difficulty expressing their emotions<br/></li><li>cares deeply about the Boxmuller to their left<br/></li><li>did something shameful in their past that they now wish to hide</li>\n</ul>\n<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Responses:</b></span>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cYes, and...\u201d<br/></li><li>\u201cYes, but...\u201d<br/></li><li>\u201cBut only if...\u201d<br/></li><li>\u201cNo, but...\u201d<br/></li><li>\u201cNo, and...\u201d<br/></li><li>\u201cThat\u2019s a funny story actually...\u201d<br/></li><li>\u201cLet's try that a different way.\u201d</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321897/#Comment_321897" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-27T00:43:02+00:00" title="April 27, 2011 12:43AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2011 3:26AM by James_Mullen.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, let's try this...<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Francois Boxmuller</b>...<br/>\n\u25e6has been granted the ability to know how someone will die, just by looking at them.<br/>\n<b>No, and</b> he is actually very short sighted, so he can't recognise anyone by sight alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u25e6has been granted the ability to see spirits and ghosts<br/>\n<b>Yes, and</b> the dead are the only things he can see clearly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u25e6has fond childhood memories of vacationing on Perdido Island<br/>\n<b>No, but</b> he did get into trouble with the Law here in his youth.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u25e6has few ties back to the mainland<br/>\n<b>That's a funny story actually</b>, because the police are after him on the mainland as well...<br/>\n<br/>\n\u25e6has difficulty expressing their emotions<br/>\n<b>Yes, but</b> he has no trouble expressing his anger.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u25e6cares deeply about the Boxmuller to their left<br/>\n<b>But only if...</b><br/>\n<br/>\n\u25e6did something shameful in their past that they now wish to hide<br/>\n<b>Let's try that a different way</b>: it's no secret that Francois is the black sheep of the family and his cousins often have to cover up for indiscretions that he is not even aware of committing!<br/>\n<br/>\nRight... the first thing that occurs to me is that your responses to some statements will constrain how you respond to others, e.g. in my first response, I made Francois short-sighted, then realised how that might constrain my response to the second statement. <b>How do you envisage character creation taking place?</b> Should players start with one statement, respond to it, then go on to the next one, in whatever order? Or should they look at both lists silmultaneously and start matching up statements to responses? Maybe a chart, with the statements on one side and the responses on the other, with the player drawing lines between them? (Yes, like in "It's Complicated")<br/>\n<br/>\nWith <b>That's a funny story actually</b>, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to provide further details or not; is it meant to be a storyline that is <i>only</i> developed in play, or am I meant to seed it when I create my character?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Let's try that a different way</b> is much easier to match to some statements than others and I can see a lot more GM guidance being required on the subject; for instance, if I matched it to <i>has few ties back to the mainland</i>, what does it mean if <i>the basic idea is true, but the specific details are different</i>? The statement looks like a basic idea with no specific details, so I'm not sure what is supposed to be 'different'.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much 'impact' and 'steering' do I have the right to when creating my character? Can I make declarations that involve the other PCs, as when I responded that the rest of the family have to cover up for Francois all the time, who is oblivious to the harm he causes? Can I create a future plot line for my PC right now, as with all the responses relatinbg to his shady past?<br/>\n<br/>\nI like this way of creating characters, its quite novel and it provokes interesting responses, but what was the thinking behind the statements given? For instance, I find <i>has difficulty expressing their emotions</i> to be an interesting choice for one of only seven questions you get to answer; with such a limited range, why have these particular statements been chosen? With every PC having an answer of some kind to all of them, what do they drive the game towards?<br/>\n<br/>\nI really want to see more of this!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321900/#Comment_321900" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-27T01:43:38+00:00" title="April 27, 2011  1:43AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are the same phrases actually used in the game later?

But I expect the players to read over both lists, then proceed from there in whatever way seems most appropriate to them personally.  As long as they are aware of the consequences of their decisions, they can respond however they choose.  Maybe even go back and change their previous answers as they realize how something will be changed by their choices.<br>\n<blockquote>With That's a funny story actually, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to provide further details or not; is it meant to be a storyline that isonly developed in play, or am I meant to seed it when I create my character?</blockquote>\nI'm still working on what the best practices are for this sort of thing, but I think it's a good idea to give a single sentence of why the statement is more complicated than it seems at first.  Then it will get further developed as its own storyline in play.\n<blockquote>Let's try that a different way is much easier to match to some statements than others and I can see a lot more GM guidance being required on the subject; for instance, if I matched it to has few ties back to the mainland, what does it mean if the basic idea is true, but the specific details are different? The statement looks like a basic idea with no specific details, so I'm not sure what is supposed to be 'different'.</blockquote>\nSome responses will be easier to apply to some statements to others.  And sometimes what seems obvious to one player won't be apparent at all to another one.  I can think of several ways to apply that response to that statement, for example.  (It does seem like I'd need to give some additional guidance on "Try it a different way", as well as "But only if" and "that's a funny story".)\n<blockquote>How much 'impact' and 'steering' do I have the right to when creating my character?

Can I create a future plot line for my PC right now, as with all the responses relating to his shady past?</blockquote>\nIn general, if the narrative addition only affects your PC, then you're fine.  If you're involving another PC, then you need to talk with the other player and get his/her permission.  So you might want to discuss an option like this with other players.  If they accept the idea, then cool.  If not, you might find a way to do the idea without impacting other PCs (make up an NPC who does or did the same basic thing), or abandon that plan and come up with something else.\n<blockquote>I like this way of creating characters, its quite novel and it provokes interesting responses, but what was the thinking behind the statements given?

The last couple are to make the feelings and internal life of the characters relevant, or at least make a player think about how the PC feels about their new life as a Reaper.  I'm still uncertain if any of these statements are fulfilling their job (hence the thread).  But this is all giving me useful info to think about.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322020/#Comment_322020" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-28T01:00:38+00:00" title="April 28, 2011  1:00AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jolly Good!<br/>\n<br/>\nA subsidiary thought I had while looking over the thread so far was to do with the 'polarity' of the statements and responses: there are 7 of each, but of the statements, 3 seem positive, 3 seem negative and one is neutral, like so:<br/>\n<br/>\n+has been granted the ability to know how someone will die, just by looking at them<br/>\n+has been granted the ability to see spirits and ghosts<br/>\n+has fond childhood memories of vacationing on Perdido Island<br/>\n<br/>\n-has few ties back to the mainland<br/>\n-has difficulty expressing their emotions<br/>\n-did something shameful in their past that they now wish to hide<br/>\n<br/>\ncares deeply about the Boxmuller to their left<br/>\n<br/>\nThe responses consist of 2 positives, 2 negatives and 3 neutrals:<br/>\n<br/>\n+Yes, and...<br/>\n+Yes, but...<br/>\n<br/>\n-No, but...<br/>\n-No, and...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut only if...<br/>\nThat\u2019s a funny story actually...<br/>\nLet's try that a different way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it is actually impossible to confirm all the positive statements and deny all the negative statements about your character, which is good and rather clever, <b>but</b> also creates situations where some characters are very capable and unhindered (because they matched polarities like to like) whilst some lack advantages and are weighed down with problems (because they matched polarities unlike to unlike).

I still don't know if potential imbalances are a major problem, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322315/#Comment_322315" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T19:41:31+00:00" title="April 29, 2011  7:41PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is a great idea!

It is, in a way, everything I wanted to make my old <i>Quite, Indubitably</i> so-called attempt at a parlor game from last year, but so much more. I like the way everything is handled with the seven responses, and how they refresh.<br>A few notes/questions/comments:<br>While there were a few typos in the document (and an instance of what looks like missing text at the end of the third paragraph on page 15), it was easy and entertaining to read. Major issue though would be the story sheets for Perdido Island and the Bone Orchard, which seem to have many of their statements erroneously meshed together (the Bone Orchard is fundamentally a modern American city? Perdido Island is made of bones and skeletons?).<br><br>When it comes to detailing NPCs, I'm assuming, like with anything else, when someone describes them and someone else uses a response, that detail and response would then be added to the story sheet for the character, yeah? Would we be whipping out a story sheet for every NPC that pops up? Or just the ones where details end up getting added? I think it might help if there had been an example how that works, like there was for character creation and running the game.<br><br>And to end with more praise, I love how you incorporated the vintage imagery into this game. While visually pretty busy, it feels like it fits just right.<br><br>In any case, I want to run this at the soonest opportunity. Maybe I can sucker some of my gaming buddies to give it a run through before our main game next Monday. I'm thinking of making some tables to allow random creation of Death Postcards. I'm also thinking that this would make a great start for a Monty Python-esque storytelling game.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323386/#Comment_323386" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-07T05:12:59+00:00" title="May  7, 2011  5:12AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad that you liked it.

Kinda what I was thinking, but just needed to be sure.<br/>But yeah, if I get a chance to play this, I will definitely write out an AP report. If I can't get some of my regular group to try it, I'll bring it along to the next west-side GoPlay PDX meetup, and try to grab some volunteers there.
