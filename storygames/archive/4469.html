FUDGE is too clean.<br/><br/>Let's think of some things.<br/><br/>There's no reason to always roll 4 dice. Ideally, you want skilled characters to be able to roll less dice, so that they can generate more predictable results. Maybe you could toy with that?<br/><br/>Get rid of the stupid adjectives. Unless you're using them in a structured freeform sense, rather than as difficulty numbers, they're counter-intuitive in the extreme.<br/><br/>Eliminate opposed versus unopposed rolls. My thought on this is to always have two sides roll. If you can't find someone to roll against, you can't do it.<br/><br/>Oh, hey, you could do something where characters had "potentials" and "masteries" for various things. So, uh, huh. Let's say that you have a potential of 9 in sword fighting, but no mastery. I think that that means you roll 9 dice to your base of 9, giving a 0-18 range. Mastery allows you to reduce the number of dice that you roll. Additionally, all rolled +s give you experience points, which boost your mastery, so the best possibile result is an untrained person who's very lucky.<br/><br/>I might want to work out a fiddly combat system around this, and use it for martial artists.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101175/#Comment_101175" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T20:04:24+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  8:04PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tend to agree about the adjectives- I've never found them especially useful, in terms of classifying my abilities (or success results).  In my head, I'm always doing the math and then trying to remember the right terminology.  "Lessee, I'm... Fair at Juggling, so I got an... *rolls, adds* uh, <i>Awesome</i> success?"<br/><br/>I think the character development system in FUDGE is a real weak point- it's always seemed like an afterthought to me.  If I were doing a Fudge-mod, I'd try to address character advancement, dealing explicitly with issues of pacing- how much advancement is appropriate for the length of the game run (i.e. a single pick-up game, a short series, a long-running campaign, etc)?  How do characters develop- can they lose traits as well as gain them?  How do you make those achievements and changes meaningful to the players?<br/><br/>I'm also interested in seeing more systems deal with character resources- money, goods, connections, favors, etc.  I'd like to see a resource mechanic that can help drive the story, creating a real sense of desperation and excitement as the characters struggle for material necessities.    Fudge doesn't really address this, as far as I can remember.  The question is how do you make resource-management mechanically clear and balanced while at the same time making it interesting and fun?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101192/#Comment_101192" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T00:59:26+00:00" title="October  5, 2007 12:59AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Getting the adjectives out of the way for mechanical application of rules is important; this is why I always rallied for printing the numerical representation along with every mention of a trait ladder adjective; especially on character sheets.<br/><br/>By different subsystems I mean relevant differences between groups of \xe2\u20ac\u017egimmicks\xe2\u20ac\u0153 \xe2\u20ac\u201c have some that allow turning of a die or dice; have some that allow rolling more or less dice (like Ben explained above); have some that slide results up or down the scales; have some that allow switching or shifting levels between traits.

It costs nothing to add that extra detail, and increases the value measurably for folks who are disinclined to (or just not good at) memorizing the adjective ladder.  That said I definitely want to keep the adjectives, because I think they add some natural language feel to the game that's attractive to the non-number-heads.  THAT said, one thing I'd like to throw into here is an officializing of the idea that (some, not all, of) the adjectives can be customized for a specific implementation as a way to reinforce the <i>genre-feel</i> of that implementation.

It was to simply roll any number of dice you wanted, knowing the more you rolled, the more zero-focused the roll is and the greater the potential is in both directions.<br/><br/>That lead to another idea.  So, taking the ladder (and some numbers to go with it), here's the change of my idea:<br/><br/>Legendary [+5]<br/>Superb [+4]<br/>Great [+3]<br/>Good [+2]<br/>Fair [+1]<br/>Mediocre [0]<br/>Fair [-1]<br/>Good [-2]<br/>Great [-3]<br/>Superb [-4]<br/>Legendary [-5]<br/><br/>Then, in your stats for whatever you're rolling, you have a number of dice you can roll for that, like 4 Fudge Dice in "Killing the Vampire King."  When that comes into play (however the rules dictate "coming into play"), you roll those dice and hope that you get a grand result on one side or the other -- it's the absolute value that is desired.<br/><br/>The fiddly bit would come in where you burn yourself out to push yourself farther.  If you need to roll more dice after getting a low result, you could "burn out" by reducing the dice in that trait by one to add two dice to this roll.  I'm thinking this is a permanent, "you need character points or need to do something special to un-burnout" effect, rather than a refresh like FATE's Aspects.<br/><br/>This idea could be crap, as it just hit 10 minutes ago and I'm firing it off before I forget.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101322/#Comment_101322" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T13:36:54+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  1:36PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I once made this thing called Double Chocolate Fudge, where the Fudge scale was a loop instead of a ladder, it goes...<br/><br/>+5<br/>+4<br/>+3<br/>+2<br/>+1<br/>0<br/>-1<br/>-2<br/>-3<br/>-4<br/>-5<br/>-4<br/>-3<br/>-2<br/>-1<br/>0<br/>+1<br/>+2<br/>+3<br/>+4<br/>+5<br/>etc.<br/><br/>It's pretty much the same thing, but represented in a different visual fashion, which allows you to do a number of neat tricks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101328/#Comment_101328" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T13:55:56+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  1:55PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it possible to hack FUDGE into ORE using matched sets of symbols instead of numbers?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101339/#Comment_101339" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T14:51:41+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  2:51PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>Is it possible to hack FUDGE into ORE using matched sets of symbols instead of numbers?</blockquote>\nInteresting.<br/><br/>Here's what I visualize.  Leave the ladder as is, you still have skills (or whatever) with a rank on that ladder.  You roll some number of Fudge dice &amp; group them by -, 0 &amp; +.<br/><br/>You use the width of that group to determine order of actions, and you apply only those dice to your skill rank.  So, if you rolled, say, - - - + , you could either take the three minuses or one plus.  The three minuses would go sooner, but you're at -3 to your skill.  Or you could take the one plus and go later in the round/turn/whatever, but you get a +1 to your skill.<br/><br/>I don't know if I like that idea, but that's what first fired off when I thought about Fudge &amp; ORE.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101495/#Comment_101495" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-07T05:15:58+00:00" title="October  7, 2007  5:15AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2007 5:17AM by Nathan_H.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            um...you could assign certain dice(different colored ones too!)to set aspects.  let's say these aspects were like  traditional stats; muscle, nerves, guts...or they could be based off of elements or feminine/masculine, sort of like the i ching.  any attempt would have a direction to it, not just success or failure.   so you wouldn't use math to add the numbers up...a "+" would be like a plus on the I ching...i think a solid line?  denoting masculine aspects?  my ching fu is a little weak.  oh, and "-" (minuses)would be broken lines...meaning feminine.  blanks would be...hmmm i don't know, maybe that aspect wouldn't come into play at all for that attempt?   maybe the roll wouldn't even tell you failure or success, but just approach.  <br/>\nso in recap, don't add the little pluses and minuses up, treat 'em like solid lines and broken lines for fortune-telling.  have different colored dice represent each trait or use more traditonal stats.  use one die per aspect or stat.  roll all your dice for every attempt.<br/>\nnot sure if this awesome-o-fies...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101499/#Comment_101499" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-07T06:03:27+00:00" title="October  7, 2007  6:03AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2007 6:04AM by DanielSolis.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>Here's what I visualize.  Leave the ladder as is, you still have skills (or whatever) with a rank on that ladder. (Snip)</blockquote>\nI was thinking about this last night a bit. An ORE-hack that I've always been fond of: Save the waste dice (the unmatched results of a roll) for later use, but in doing so you have that many fewer dice to use in future rolls until you spend the saved dice.<br/><br/>For example, if you've just tried to stab an orc using Dex+Stabbing, giving you a dice pool of 6, your results might be <span style="font-family: Courier;">- - 0 0 0 +</span>. As per your example, you could use that single <span style="font-family: Courier;">+</span> right now for a plus 1 shift on the ladder, but you might also save it for later.<br/><br/>Let's say you do decide to keep it and you're trying to stab the orc again. Because you're saving a die, your Dex+Stabbing die pool is now 5 instead of 6, but at least you know you're guaranteed one <span style="font-family: Courier;">+</span> result. This roll will just determine if you get any <i>other</i> <span style="font-family: Courier;">+</span>'s. You roll, and the results are... <span style="font-family: Courier;">+ + 0 0 -</span>. Now you can spend the one die you saved from the previous roll and get a set of three <span style="font-family: Courier;">+</span>'s instead of just two. After spending the die, your dice pool would return to its normal size.<br/><br/>If that roll had gone another way, resulting in <span style="font-family: Courier;">+ 0 0 - -</span>, you could save that lone <span style="font-family: Courier;">+</span> again, lowering the dice pool for your subsequent rolls by two until you spend those two <span style="font-family: Courier;">+</span>'s.<br/><br/>Fudge ORE doesn't quite feel awesome enough yet though. The humble <span style="font-family: Courier;">0</span> is getting the shaft.<br/><br/>The other idea I had was to flip things around ORX-style, where the dice roll doesn't determine success, it determines what you did to succeed. If we go with the old Tri-Stat standby of Physical (<span style="font-family: Courier;">+</span>), Mental (<span style="font-family: Courier;">-</span>) and Social (<span style="font-family: Courier;">0</span>), the symbols have no positive or negative connotations, they just represent the three different ways you could've succeeded. The size of the matched sets determines how high up the ladder the mental, social or physical success goes.<br/><br/>For each conflict, you roll your dice pool (as determined by some fourth stat or confluence of the tri-stats), and read the resulting sets. If you rolled six dice, resulting in <span style="font-family: Courier;">+ - - 0 0 0</span>, that represents social success with a +3 shift on the ladder, a mental success with a +2 shift, or a physical success with a +1 shift, You can only choose one of these ways of succeeding, leaving some other dice unused...<br/><br/>Combine this with the first idea about saving the waste dice and you have some interesting mechanical fiddliness. Using the roll in the previous paragraph, you've accepted the social success, but you may also save some of the unused dice for a future roll. If you saved the two <span style="font-family: Courier;">-</span>'s, it means you're that much more likely to succeed mentally. It's a very direct way players to control how their characters behave, without getting into the fluffier narrative territory that may be off-putting to traditional-game players.<br/><br/>Not to extend this post even further, but I'm now seeing an implied fourth and fifth stat in addition to Mental/Social/Physical.<br/><br/>The fourth stat would determine how many dice you're allowed to keep. Let's call it <i>Yin</i>, because it's focused on the <i>in</i>ternal, like <i>in</i>haling. <i>Yin</i> the size of your metaphorical backpack. If you rolled <span style="font-family: Courier;">+ - - 0 0 0</span>, and your <i>Yin</i> is 2, you may keep up to two of the unused results from that roll. You could keep one now, saving an open spot for another result later; or you could keep two now and fill up your pack immediately.<br/><br/>The fifth stat would determine how many dice you're allowed to spend from your reserve. Let's call it <i>Yang</i>, because it's focused on the external, like exhaling. Say you've got a <span style="font-family: Courier;">+ +</span> stored in your reserve, but your <i>Yang</i> is only 1, you could only spend one die at a time for a roll. <br/><br/>This presents a tricky issue about whether there's any purpose in <i>Yang</i> ever being higher than <i>Yin</i>, but that's beyond the scope of this already lengthy post. :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doug%20Ruff" title="Doug Ruff"><img alt="Doug Ruff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doug%20Ruff">Doug Ruff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102325/#Comment_102325" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T15:16:58+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  3:16PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Instead of adding lot's of cool stuff to the basic FUDGE rules, how about stripping it down as far as possible?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne idea: re-scale everything relative to the PCs.

In point of fact, the more dice you roll, the higher the actual standard deviation becomes. I made the same mistake about a similar system, and was corrected on this (by Walt Frietag, I think). People assume that more dice means that there standard deviation goes down, but this is not true. What goes down is the ratio between the standard deviation and the number of possibilities in the range. <br>\n<br>\nFor instance, the standard deviation for one die is 1, which over three potential results is quite broad, or a ratio of .333. For 2dF, the standard deviation is 1.22, over a range of 5 possible results, or a ratio of .245.

And to some extent, SOTC already has this built in, with the way the skill pyramid functions (having a peak seems to naturally encourage folks to have different apex skills) -- but I am going to back away from that observation rapidly as the point here is NOT to talk about Fate. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TheCzech" title="TheCzech"><img alt="TheCzech" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TheCzech">TheCzech</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102785/#Comment_102785" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T15:00:01+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  3:00PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike,<br/><br/>If you want to get really pedantic, there is no curve at all because this is a discrete distribution, not a continuous one...and a finite one at that.  But this distinction serves mathematical rigor far more than it does the discussion.  <br/><br/>The ratio between the standard deviation and the range of possibilities is probably actually the more useful statistic when evaluating a dice mechanic since the result range itself is purely symbolic in nature and can be rescaled at will.<br/><br/><br/>On another note, the bonus die mechanic from TSoY is very interesting.  As has been pointed out, it leaves the minimum and maximum results untouched, and it increases the mean result while decreasing the standard deviation (now a more useful number since the overall range is unchanged).   You have both a higher average result and a more predictable result.<br/><br/>So, in a TSoY-inspired system, an additional skill level increases your result by one across the board, but a "luck point" merely give you a more stable positive dice result.  It is interesting to picture what might happen in a system where these roles were reversed: a higher skill level gives a bonus die and a luck point gives you the straight up +1.  In the original TSoY-inspired system, spending luck points is good for a guard against bad die rolls, but it is a tactic that won't help you win out against a higher skill level in the long run.<br/><br/>In the reversed system, I'd truly rather be lucky than good.  A higher skill level is nice, but your supply of luck points will be the major determining factor in whether or not you win conflicts unless the difference in skill levels is significant and/or the supply of luck points is low overall.  That automatically feels like a less gritty and more epic system to me.  Even if I am the only one, I find that  interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102797/#Comment_102797" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T15:16:54+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  3:16PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2007 3:17PM by John_Powell.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Momentum Die</b> - when in combat or any other type of extended conflict, roll 4dF with one die a different color from all the rest.

Fred or Rob?) <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are math terms being tossed about here without, I think, an understanding of what they mean precisely. So let's skip the technical terms for now. To be clear, more dice have the following effects:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) the average roll will tend to be farther away from zero than with fewer dice. People who understand the probabilities often make the mistake of assuming that the reverse is true... I did. <br/>\n2) the chances of rolling a zero go down. In fact the chances of rolling any particular result go down the more dice you roll. <br/>\n3) the chances of rolling a result at the end of the range of possible results goes down even faster than those in the middle.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlotted, these altogether are what produce the "bell" shape in the curve. The more dice, the more "bellish" the shape. This is more centered on zero than a "flat curve," which is the result of rolling a single die. But the more dice you roll, the further out it spreads the average distribution. The average just spreads out more slowly than the range of the curve does. So as a proportion of possible results, more dice means more "zero based." But in terms of actual figures compared from one curve to the next, it's less "zero based." <br/>\n<br/>\nSo for what we're talking about here, more dice means "wilder" results, since it's all on the same scale. Not so much in that we'll tend to get very high or low results, but we will tend to get higher or lower results on average than rolling less dice. <br/>\n<br/>\nClear as mud? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. BTW, everybody is aware that a Fudge Die is a D3-2, right? And that you can change the range and such by just changing the die type, and that you don't have to make it zero-based either, just getting rid of the -2. I mean, basically, this curve is essentially no different than the GURPs curve, other than aesthetically, and in terms of the breadth of the range of results. An interesting modification is to make it D-whatever-1. With this you have from zero to x-1 times the sides of the dice, times the number of dice rolled. D10s are really good for this, since they already have the zero printed instead of the ten, and can just be read that way. 3D10, counting zeroes as zeroes produces a pretty useful curve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103595/#Comment_103595" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T06:11:01+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  6:11AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For those of us who are very interested in this probability discussion, but terribly incapable of groking abstract numbers, is there some kind of chart or other visual aid to help us (okay, I mean me) understand?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103685/#Comment_103685" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T10:45:59+00:00" title="October 18, 2007 10:45AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, you need remove the word "average" from (1) and say something like "typical".

So now we can see what Mike's talking about. As you roll more dice, the chance of hitting a given <i>absolute</i> range centered on zero decreases. E.g. with 1dF,  you're guaranteed a result between -1 and +1. With 4dF the chance of getting a result in that range decreases to 51/81 or about 63%.<br/><br/>The seeming paradox is that if you look at, say, the middle 33% of each range, the probability of hitting it goes up. With 1dF, the middle 33% is exactly zero and the chance of hitting it is 33%. With 4dF the middle 33% of the range -4 to +4 is -1 to +1 (the middle three results out of the nine possible) and as I just mentioned, the chance of hitting that range is close to 63%.<br/><br/>The solution to the paradox is to note that we're comparing apples and oranges: absolute ranges vs. relative ranges. People always make this mistake about the Central Limit Theorem (that's what we're dealing with here in Probability Theory): the theorem says the more you flip a fair coin, the closer the <i>ratio</i> of heads/tails gets to 1:1; people think this means the more you flip the coin, the smaller the absolute difference between heads &amp; tails. 1028:1000 is closer to 1:1 than 5:1 is, but the former is an unremarkable result for a fair coin even though it has an absolute difference of 28.<br/><br/>With Fudge dice, we're only interested in the absolute ranges. So, more dice =&gt; more likelihood you'll get a result that's far from zero.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103924/#Comment_103924" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-19T19:01:26+00:00" title="October 19, 2007  7:01PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *brain explodes*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lunch4worms" title="lunch4worms"><img alt="lunch4worms" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lunch4worms">lunch4worms</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103930/#Comment_103930" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-19T20:14:26+00:00" title="October 19, 2007  8:14PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excel doesn't have the best graphing routines for math.

If you are interested in the probability of the values between -2 and +2, you look at the area under the bell curve between -2 and +2 (don't try to calculate it, you'll just confuse the point).

A character's skill/trait/mastery level allows them to remove up to one die from the roll (after it is rolled) from the result for every point the skill/trait/mastery level.<br/><br/>Now, just to make it cooler, how 'bout this option.  The target number you are rolling against is something you are trying to roll <b>exactly</b>.  Negative results are for "little things" and positive results for "big things".  This gives you a narrative result from the roll.  Big result against a little target: your "open door" spell blows the door off it's hinges instead of opening the lock.  Small result against a big target: your sword-tip hits the knight's breast-plate and goes "pink".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124777/#Comment_124777" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-06T11:20:02+00:00" title="February  6, 2008 11:20AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Risk-based Fudge resolution using a single d6:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.fudgerpg.info/guide/bin/view/Guide/FudgeOned6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fudgerpg.info/guide/bin/view/Guide/FudgeOned6</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124946/#Comment_124946" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-07T10:31:47+00:00" title="February  7, 2008 10:31AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2008 10:33AM by John_Powell.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting!<br/><br/>My 2 cents: I would want to stipulate that the bonus cannot exceed the penalty you are willing to take. Then I would use a d10 instead of a d6 for easy calculation of odds. And use 6 as the default target number to 'balance' it for pulp. Grittier settings might use 7 or 8 as the default target number.<br/><br/>To rewrite your example:<br/><br/>Bob has Fair Agility. He needs to jump across a chasm that's really really wide. The GM says he needs a Great result to make it.<br/>Bob needs to gamble to have any chance of success! He needs a bonus of +2 to make it across, so that's the bonus he's going for. He's also desperate enough that he's willing to risk a -4 (a Terrible result)--there are armed bandits behind him, and he figures he'll probably die if he doesn't make it anyway.<br/>That gives him a final target number of 4 (6 + the bonus of 2 - the penalty of 4 = 4).<br/>He rolls the die--on a 4 or higher, his result is Great (Fair + 2), and he makes the leap! On a 3 or lower, however, his result is Terrible (Fair - 4)...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

                         Also needs controls to make sure you can't take a penalty large enough that it removes the possibility of failure.<br/><br/>I have Fair, and I need to roll Great?  Okay, +2 is the bonus I need... that's 6+2, I take a -7 on failure.  I succeed on 1 or higher!<br/><br/>This might be in the original doc (I read it yesterday, so today's memory is what it is), but limiting the bonus and penalty range to -4 to +4, like on fudge dice, could be reasonably effective on that front.<br/><br/>This also bakes in the idea that performing *at* your skill level never needs to be rolled: I want a +0 bonus and risk a -0 penalty.  I roll 6 or higher, +0! I roll 5 or less, -0!<br/><br/>Consequence of one of the mods suggested:<br/><br/>If your bonus can never exceed your penalty, the smallest chance of failure (penalty, at least) someone will ever face is 50% (6+ on a d10).  Since bonus is always less than or equal to penalty, 6 is the highest target number someone would ever experience.<br/><br/>This also means that the smallest chance of making any bonus, no matter how large, is 50%.  And usually, if folks game the system to maximize this, they'll face a penalty of -4, so the base target is 2, plus the bonus you want; 10% increased chance of failure for every +1 you seek (minimum of +1, so 20% chance, since as I note above, +0/-0 is a safe bet).<br/><br/>I'm not sold on this dicing method, ultimately.  Even if you got rid of the "bonus cannot exceed the penalty" (in which case you could give yourself a 10% chance of getting a +4 vs. a 90% chance of getting a +0) it just ends up pushing the math to places where I get tempted to say "why not set aside the dice and just Take Zero on everything".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125045/#Comment_125045" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-07T17:42:47+00:00" title="February  7, 2008  5:42PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2008 5:44PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The rule for the original (d6) version is:<br/><br/>--Penalty must be at least -1, and cannot be greater than -4.<br/><br/>Fred, do your comments apply to the d6 method, or just to the d10 proposed modification?<br/><br/>(Note, for instance, that the "default" case is that on a 1-3 you act at your level -1, whereas on a 4-6 you act at your normal level.

If you want, you can gamble more from your Pool.<br/><br/>Roll them dice!<br/><br/>1. Take all your (-) results and put them aside.<br/>2. Do you have at least one (+) result? If so, count your remaining dice. Increase your effective trait level by one for each die remaining.<br/>3. If you did not have any (+) results, lower your effective trait level by one for each die in the (-) pool you just set aside.<br/><br/>I recommend you use Anti-Pool with this, or stick purely to contested rolls (i.e. against someone).<br/><br/>Under this system, one die roughly equals a Trait level (Trait levels are a little more powerful, though).<br/><br/>Therefore, unless you're using huge Pools, I'd recommend the following reduced Fudge ladder:<br/><br/>(Incredible)<br/>Superb<br/>Great<br/>Good<br/>Mediocre<br/>Lousy<br/><br/>(These rules may seem a little weird.

I was also pondering the <a href="http://www.twistedconfessions.com/snowball.php" rel="nofollow">Snowball</a> mechanic, itself derived from The Pool. OK, so what if we invert this, and make failure more likely with increased numbers of dice?<br/><br/>The deal: roll some number of d6, <b>at least</b> as many specified by the GM, more if you like. Rolled a 1? That's bad: count the 1's for your down-the-ladder result. No 1, but rolled a 6? That's good: count the 6's for your up-the-ladder result. No 1 or 6? You've "rolled a zero."<br/><br/>The more dice you roll, the lower your chance to perform at or above trait level: more dice effectively represent greater stress, chaos, or potential for bad things. The odds for getting +1 or higher are less straightforward: they peak at 4 dice (28.5%), then slowly decline, so there is incentive for taking moderate risk. This also means that the probability of a zero result (no 1's or 6's) shrinks rather rapidly: two-thirds to the Nth power for N dice. (This is one reason why I'd use plain old d6 rather than Fudge dice: the extremes are too heavily represented, and the probability of a zero result is less than 4% at only three dice.)<br/><br/>This provides another way of offering bonuses or penalties. Cool under fire? Great -- you don't have to roll as many dice as the poor fellow next to you. Extra dice also don't lower the mean result too greatly: rolling six dice gives an average result of -0.6, and extremes (+/- 4 or greater) are still very rare (less than 2%).<br/><br/>Is it still Fudge? I think so. The ladder is still there. There are tons of Fudge dice techniques, not all involving Fudge dice. This one is just more failure-ish. More importantly, would this be fun? Are there any well-known games in which a player's rolling more dice is a bad thing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4469/awesome-o-fy-the-fudge-system-without-using-fate" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4469/awesome-o-fy-the-fudge-system-without-using-fate" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4469/awesome-o-fy-the-fudge-system-without-using-fate/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F4469%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F4469%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
