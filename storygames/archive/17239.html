There\u2019s a Kickstarter off the port bow, and she\u2019s loaded down with pirate goodness.  Strike the jib sheets and run out the guns!</b><br/><br/><b>What is this game?</b><br/>Bluebeard! is a card and board game that I've designed for 3-6 players, age 12+. The central idea that I was exploring with the design came to me when I was playing Risk (or some other dice-rolling board game) with my 9-year-old daughter.  No matter how well I planned, I had the worst luck rolling the dice, and my plans would fall apart.  But instead of cursing any game with dice in it, I started thinking.  What if I could design a game where there were a lot of mini-games you played in order to progress in the central game?  These mini-games could use cards or other mechanics that might require some luck, but would also contain more strategy, or bluffing, or other skills that players might be better at than simply rolling dice.<br/>After doing a lot of research into the history of board games, I realized there was a deep vein of obsolete or unplayed games out there that could be simplified and turned into quick version for play in a larger board game.  The result was Bluebeard!, the board game that I'm presenting for this Kickstarter.<br/><br/>I'll be posting far more in-depth information about the development of the game (along with helpful tips for other board game designers starting out) at the game's official site at <a href="http://bluebeard.elsewares.org" rel="nofollow">bluebeard.elsewares.org</a><br/><br/><b>Story-Games Aside</b><br/><br/>As a 'hidden' bonus for storygames players and fans, I'm co-developing a set of narrative rules to use the map pieces, tokens and other bits of the board game as the resources in a story game.  I'll publish this as a free PDF to all and sundry, but I'll print and sign a copy for anyone from Story Games who backs the Kickstarter at the $50 level and up.<br/><br/><b>So how do you play?</b><br/><br/>In Bluebeard! you play a pirate sailing the Seven Seas, capturing and plundering vessels, avoiding the attention of the authorities, dueling your peers for the best of the treasure,and drinking more rum than you can shake a peg-leg at.  The goal is either to accumulate enough gold to buy a pardon from His Honor the Governor of Tortuga, or to defeat the greatest pirate of all - Bluebeard himself!<br/><br/>The players construct the board at the beginning of the game from map tiles, so that no two games of Bluebeard! will ever be the same.  You ply the seas searching for lost treasures, plunder colonies and kidnap governors (or their daughters), run kegs of rum past the noses of the Royal Navy, capture ships and create a pirate armada.<br/><br/>There are four mini-games that you'll play as you sail the map:<br/><br/>Broadside : A variation of Shut-the-Box, where you roll dice to get combinations to knock out your opponent's cannons, either on their ship or in their fortress.<br/>En Garde : Duels between pirates are settled playing Bloody Royals, a game played with a the face cards of a standard playing-card deck.<br/>Avast : A variation on checkers, played to board ships and pillage towns for loot.<br/>Scoundrel : A variation on Liar's Dice, used to search for buried treasure and evade the Royal Navy in running rum.<br/><br/>I\u2019m producing the first run of the game myself, and I really do believe in the crowdfunding model of supporting creative projects.  I\u2019m looking forward to interacting with my backers and polling them on which expansions they\u2019d like to see produced first.<br/><br/>For more information, visit: <br/><br/><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elsewares/bluebeard-the-board-game?ref=RPGnet" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elsewares/bluebeard-the-board-game?ref=RPGnet</a><br/><br/><b>Who the hell are you?</b><br/><br/>My name is Brian Hollenbeck (aka Kuma), and I'm an independent web developer whose company is called Elsewares.  The other half of what I do is game design and development, but this is the first time that I'm tackling a board game.  Previous to this, I've either helped others playtest and analyze their games, or I've worked on very experimental games, namely Time Traitor and Terrible World.  This is the first time that I've felt that a design has both been strong and readily accessible - and so I'm putting it out on Kickstarter for you to consider.<br/>Part of the reason that I'm pursuing this now is that I have an excellent illustrator, Matt LaFleur, to work with.  I met Matt through mutual friends, and the minute I saw his art, I knew I wanted to work with him on creating a game. We talked it over, and Bluebeard! came to the top of the pile for both of us.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daniel_ream" title="daniel_ream"><img alt="daniel_ream" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daniel_ream">daniel_ream</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391024/#Comment_391024" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-21T09:35:37+00:00" title="September 21, 2012  9:35AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You probably meant Blackbeard, there, as Bluebeard almost certainly has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebeard" rel="nofollow">connotations you were not intending</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391030/#Comment_391030" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-21T10:53:17+00:00" title="September 21, 2012 10:53AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/daniel_ream">@daniel_ream</a>: MEH.

The Blue vs. black beard thing seems to me like the sort of comic twist that's typical of German boardgame flavour. Just throw in a reference in the rulebook to how the pirate Bluebeard just can't seem to find a wife and settle down no matter how hard he tries, just so the audience knows that it's intentional.<br/><br/>Out of academic curiousity, how do you handle the downtime caused by the minigames? The basic idea seems interesting, and I could see at least three ways for doing it (either slot players out of the main game for the duration of the mini-game, or have players advance each mini-game by only a few turns at a time, or arrange the mini-games into Spione-style flashpoints where everybody plays at once), so I'm curious as to what your approach is like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391089/#Comment_391089" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-22T08:29:25+00:00" title="September 22, 2012  8:29AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You probably meant Blackbeard, there, as Bluebeard almost certainly has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebeard" rel="nofollow">connotations you were not intending</a>.</blockquote>\nI did mean Blackbeard, but there's already been a couple of board games called Blackbeard: <br/><br/><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/235/blackbeard" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/235/blackbeard</a><br/><br/><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25685/blackbeard" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25685/blackbeard</a><br/><br/>Including a really good one from GMT.  I tried a bunch of possible colors and Bluebeard was the only one that made any real sense. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Eero: Thanks for asking!  In playtesting, what we've basically come up with is a system where you take your turn until you get to a mini-game point, then pause your turn.  Everyone does this, then you all play your mini-games either in parallel (if there's more than one game type being played) or serially (if you and your opponent are both boarding a ship, you play the two games against each other).  In theory, the game could hold up to 10 players, but we found that logistically, if there are more than three pairs playing the minigames simultaneously, it's chaos.<br/><br/>After the games finish, everyone takes a turn to finish out their turn (which is usually just movement or going into port).  So it breaks down pretty easily into: <br/><br/>1. Move<br/>2. Engage<br/>3. Game<br/>4. Resolve<br/>5. Maintenance<br/><br/>I'm also playing around with the idea of 'piggy-backing' minigames, but I'm not sure if that's necessary mechanically.  I'm concentrating more on keeping the mini-games as quick and elegant as possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391941/#Comment_391941" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-01T08:27:34+00:00" title="October  1, 2012  8:27AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in the process of winding this down, now.

Most the games I donate to are much farther along in the design process and have at least example art and often a video of play. I seldom care who the person is that is behind the kickstarter or what they have done before. I only look for what will the game look like in my hands and does it look fun to play. It's hard to get either of those from your kickstarter. Also yes for your first kickstarter the goal is a bit high.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
