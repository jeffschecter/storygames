Most gamers I know have a significant number of games on their shelves that they have never played, and would probably admit they will likely not play. I think to a certain extent there is a strong "enamoured expectation of happy play" that prompts the sale that may not connect very well with the practical reality of actually playing.<br/><br/>I also know several people who make a distinction between games books they know they bought just because they like to read them, for one reason or another (background, to see how the rules are explained, to marvel at the layouts and artwork, etc, etc) and the game books they know they bought because they were actually going to use them in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148150/#Comment_148150" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T14:33:10+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  2:33PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: viktor_haag</cite>Because the target market for RPGs represents a perfect storm combining poor impulse control, youth, a skewed sense of disaffected entitlement, and just-gotta-have-it collector neurosis?</blockquote>\nAWESOME answer! <br/><br/>I wonder if any of this correlates to pirating digital copies of books. A few years ago I ran events locally in public spaces and I met many people who had huge print outs of their favorite RPGs. When I asked them why they didn't buy them, the general answers was, "why should I when I can get them for free?" In general I stopped playing with people who derived rewards from other people's work without permission and without giving back someway (I'm willing to define giving back fairly loosely). To be fair, many of these people were between the ages of 18-25. But then again, they were also NYU and Columbia students (very expensive schools). I actually grew up fairly poor and in high school I would skip several lunches to raise my share of the cost of an RPG book that I would split with several of my friends.

The most stolen item in the book trade is, by far, the Bible.  Followed by any adult book or magazine you can name.  Followed by RPG books &amp; anything in the 'New Age' section.  Make of that what you will...  <br/><br/>One 'customer' who was caught trying to pilfer a Bible was quoted as saying (I'm paraphrasing, here) "The word of God should be free.  How dare you charge money for it."<br/>My wife's comment was that the Gideon's Society will give you a Bible for free, all you have to do is ask, so why steal one?  Of course, the ones that get stolen are the nicer editions.  Make of <i>that</i> what you will, too.<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148555/#Comment_148555" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T06:00:44+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  6:00AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dain, I would have never guessed that either!
