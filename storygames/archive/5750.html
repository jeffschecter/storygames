Paul, understanding your desire to know if the game is for you before hand, and wanting to help, the problem isn't so much that you should have to rely on the skills you use with movies and books and such. We can try to help. I'm just not sure how to do so. What do you think would help here? Better blurbs?</blockquote>\nTo clarify, the beforehand here is before play. What I want (and I'd like to think that others want it too, but that remains to be seen) is for the game text to inform me what the play experience is like. Good ways that I've seen to do this:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Tell me flat out what you as designer want out of your game</b>. <i>Sons of Liberty</i> tells me to expect a game of awesomeness and badassery, where people are shouting over each other and throwing cards around. If I'm not into that, I know right away to put it down.</li>\n<li><b>Explaining the whys of rules, not just the hows</b>. Luke does this with his three sidebar voices in both Burning Wheel and Burning Empires. If you made a design choice in order to facilitate a certain play experience, I want to know that. When the rule's implication for play is made clear, it makes the play experience clearer.</li>\n<li><b>Real examples of play</b>. In one of the Delta Green books, there's an brief sidebar about what happened during the playtest of a scenario. It immediately gave the adventure a life to it that it didn't have before, and I suddenly had a much better idea how to run it.</li>\n</ul>\nI'm sure there are more ways, and (as someone working on a game right now) I'd love to hear other people's ideas.<br/><br/>The side benefit of doing these things is that they not only help me decide whether or not to play your game, they help me actually play the game you intend.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

When you're writing up your back cover text, or your web page copy, or whatever, you really need to figure out what your game <em>does</em> -- not what it's about, not how it works, not where it comes from.  And then you need to articulate that.  Identify your product's features, and then explain how they serve to benefit the consumer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128636/#Comment_128636" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T11:55:25+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 11:55AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh, <br/><br/>Yea.

I actually write up PDF summaries for every game I run, and print them out to have at hand during the game.<br/><br/>Another thing I love seeing on the back cover of every story game is how many players the game is designed to accomodate or work best with in actual play. This along with a list of "accessories" that I need to play the game. Tell me how many dice of each type I need per participant. I'm after something similar to how board games list contents, number of players, game time, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
