It was simple, sure, but I didn't really feel like it did anything super exciting or clever or interesting.  It gave us a way to resolve killing monsters, and some cool magic items and stuff, but I... just don't really understand the love, I guess?  </blockquote>\nSo I thought, why not give him some ideas of what to look at here, because I totally see interesting mechanical features in that there game. But, out of threat topic - and therefore, a new thread.<br/><br/>So, I think that original D&amp;D has interesting game design in it. I am a bit of a designer myself, and an aficionado of game design, so I'm confident that I know my business when I say that D&amp;D has unique bits that are interesting for anybody who likes unique game design.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it's obvious that many people disagree. I think that I know why, because I was <i>most</i> lukewarm about D&amp;D for like 15 years before I really got into it; I am, essentially, an outsider to the game when you compare to some real hardcore "D&amp;D only" gamers. I'll speculate a bit:<br/><br/>I think that the issue for many is that they got into the game too young - D&amp;D is a wargame, IMO creatively better suited for 30-somethings than children. Of course the game has its virtues as a childhood game as well, but when the way you look at the game has been preconceived through teenager eyes, it's difficult to look at it in any other way, right? I can imagine that if I had played more than a couple of miscomprehending one-shots as a child, I'd find it impossible to drop those associations about what the game's like, too.<br/><br/>Then there's of course also the fact that the publishing company has done its damnedest to dumb the game down, and also the tribal identity issues where people cherish their status as non-D&amp;D gamers (just like others cherish their position as part of the D&amp;D tribe). Lots of reasons for why it's difficult to see the virtues of the game in a plain light.<br/><br/>Anyway, that wasn't my main point. I wanted to put down some observations about what is interesting and clever in D&amp;D's mechanics. Consider the following points:<br/><br/><b>*</b> Hit point mechanics give the game an abstract, resource-based conflict resolution clock that runs down with organic task resolution events. This is exactly the same idea that e.g. <i>Heroquest</i> does with its extended contest mechanics, except the implementation is arguably more to the point. (It's also the original, for what that's worth.) This basic chassis is something very powerful, very functional, and often repeated in other games in various forms.<br/><br/><b>*</b> The concept of "hit dice" (and "level", its specific application to PCs) as a single-number streamlining of a given monster's or character's mechanical gravity in the game is an elegant, to the point abstraction that does much more work for maintaining the economy of the game's structure than many, many other games do. You can immediately see how something like e.g. <i>Runequest</i> crumbles into an incoherent mess of near-inapplicable rules mechanics once the designers accept the idea that it's OK to expect the GM to track and care about 20-50 numbers regarding each individual NPC. D&amp;D in comparison gives you the concept of universal mechanical weight: this monster is "1" HD worth of meaningful to the situation, this other one is "5" HD worth, and so on. This mechanical basic premise is precisely as elegant as your average complexity-controlled story game.<br/><br/>(Nota bene: <i>Tunnels &amp; Trolls</i> does the same thing with its monster rating, and arguably the details of the implementation are even more stream-lined there, because it's more feasible to run a T&amp;T monster with the single-stat approach than it is for a classical D&amp;D monster. Nevertheless, the idea appeared first in D&amp;D.)<br/><br/><b>*</b> The game has a general social situation resolution system that is not conflict-based; rather, it has an initial mechanically formal part where the GM establishes a social stance for the NPC counterparty, and then the players get to negotiate what exactly a "helpful" NPC of this or that type is willing to do for them. I find this approach interesting and different from the more usual ways of mechanizing social encounters.<br/><br/><b>*</b> Contents of play are, rather uniquely to the RPG tradition, created procedurally with a heavy randomization element. The method combines heavy reliance on on-the-spot aesthetic intuition with carefully standardized prep-work. The GM does not preplan or control the experience of play, yet nevertheless proceeding with play is effortless. Is this not a wonderful and clever accomplishment, even today?<br/><br/><b>*</b> The game features an experience system with objective awards for accomplishment and a bold, even radical effectiveness curve for developing characters. Both of these elements are, perhaps surprisingly considering the game's stature, very rare in other games. They contribute to an unique game experience.<br/><br/><b>*</b> The game's structure supports one-shots, campaign play, character stables, constantly shifting game groups, a player range from 1 to 20, with low-performance and high-performance players playing together. This feature of ultra-flexibility alone makes D&amp;D worthy of the <i>most careful</i> consideration for anybody trying to actually understand social footprints of games and how the game's premise and methodology contribute to setting the hard constraints within which the game necessarily operates.<br/><br/><b>*</b> The game has a precedent-based approach to the concept of "rules", with a central referee judging and tracking precedent for the game group. This is entirely unique in the rpg field, and a different paradigm to both traditional GM-fiat and boardgame-like games with fixed rules. Even if nothing else entices, surely an unique, even bizarre look into a world where "game" and "rule" mean entirely different things is of interest?<br/><br/>There's probably other interesting stuff in there as well, but those are what occur to me off the top of my head. I'll also note that this is not some sort of superficial apologia; all of the above are elements of D&amp;D that I have specifically discovered and delighted over myself, and adopted into my design toolbox for future game development. I've learned a lot from older D&amp;D, and it's such an unique game that surely others can as well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460618/#Comment_460618" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-23T21:39:39+00:00" title="February 23, 2017  9:39PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An excellent overview, Eero!<br/><br/>I think that much of D&amp;D's "negative" connotations have to do with its history as the first and most popular RPG. This meant that it had to serve (and still does, for many) as the one game which could do "anything". Unfortunately, the authors of the texts didn't have any idea (and this is not entirely their fault, since the vocabulary didn't exist for many of these concepts at the time) how to communicate this to players.<br/><br/>When you get so many people playing in so many different ways, and game text authors committed to the idea of selling their game as a road to "anything you want", as well, misunderstandings and disappointment are sure to surface.<br/><br/>I also feel that D&amp;D, particularly in its "old-school" formulation, comprises a combination of factors and game dynamics that is almost entirely unique in the RPG world.

The historical significance is, I think, trivial - I don't think I've ever seen anybody suggest that D&amp;D was <i>not</i> a formative influence for the entire medium.<br/><br/>But setting aside the historical interest, I don't think that D&amp;D, when read constructively and applied smartly, loses to many games at all in terms of sheer inventive uniqueness. I say this as somebody for whom old school D&amp;D is not in any way a baseline for comparing other games to; for me that baseline is formed by the second generation of games, the "traditional" style of game as I like to call them: if those games are what a "normal" roleplaying game is like, then D&amp;D is just absolutely one of the weirdest games I've ever played. It wouldn't need to go very far to be outside the hobby (as defined by e.g. Runequest) altogether. It sort of doesn't surprise me at all that I didn't get it in my teen years - how could I, when I'd learned rpgs from texts that have an entirely different conception of just about every fundamental of play.<br/><br/>This weirdness is only emphasized by what Paul notes: due to historical accident, D&amp;D's game design philosophy, the "school" of it if you will, hasn't had a very high profile in the rpg scene of the recent decades. The immense success of the one single game has played its part, but the end result is that there just aren't that many games similar to old-school D&amp;D in their deeper bits. (You might have better luck looking at wargames, in fact - I don't really know.) This, in part, supports the relevance of D&amp;D to this day: while one may argue that e.g. <i>Champions</i> has been superseded by progeny that captures its ideas better, D&amp;D definitely has not been. (Or it there is some game out there that totally supersedes it, do please let me know - I want to check it out.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460629/#Comment_460629" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-23T22:18:37+00:00" title="February 23, 2017 10:18PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, Paul: you should totally look into <i>Tunnels &amp; Trolls</i>, it's one of the few legit vehicles for D&amp;D play without D&amp;D mechanics.

So this gives rise to the "Player Skill" interpretation of the game, which can be a very creatively empowering style of play for the right people. Compared to the (potentially contentious) interpretation of later editions as games where you're confined by what's written on your character sheet and what options the rules give you (and it can't be said that these editions of the game are not option-rich, at least), it's a game where anything <b>not</b> explicitly spelled out is something that you can try, if only you can conceive of the idea yourself.<br/><br/>While this is nothing new to a lot of people who prefer freeform and/or rules-light gaming, for gamers who only really knew roleplaying from the succeeding generation of games (I'd wager I'm probably talking about many of the same ones that Eero just referred to as "traditional"), I think it was their "rediscovery" of this style of play by reading older game texts that was, at least in part, responsible for the OSR boom in the first place.<br/><br/>Conversely, I feel like I owe a shout out to the concept sometimes called "Gygaxian Naturalism" and how it uses game mechanics to model a world, something that really came into full bloom with the first edition of AD&amp;D. While it creates a web of sometimes arcane procedures and restrictions, almost 30 years later I still find something fascinating when I see lists of "No. Appearing," how many noncombatant goblins there might be in a warren, the chance they might be riding worgs, what sort of petty goblin treasures they have, and things of that nature. If nothing else it was a wildly ambitious attempt at <i>something</i>. <br/><br/>I've always been a sucker for games with lots of random tables, and I think part of this even feeds into the "Player Skill" style of play, where even the GM can't necessarily prepare for everything, meaning she has to (gets to) be as quick on her feet as the players are in reacting to unexpected situations, and which I might go so far as to argue even creates a level of disconnect that can serve as a cushion against over-application of GM force (things like railroading or fudging for the sake of a preconceived plot).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460641/#Comment_460641" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-24T02:30:07+00:00" title="February 24, 2017  2:30AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I've always been a sucker for games with lots of random tables, and I think part of this even feeds into the "Player Skill" style of play, where even the GM can't necessarily prepare for everything, meaning she has to (gets to) be as quick on her feet as the players are in reacting to unexpected situations, and which I might go so far as to argue even creates a level of disconnect that can serve as a cushion against over-application of GM force (things like railroading or fudging for the sake of a preconceived plot).</blockquote>\nOh, absolutely!<br/><br/>I think this is one of the reasons that "random tables" - such a prominent design feature of early D&amp;D - were stripped out of later "traditional" games.

Dismiss the idea if you want, but give it some thought first.<br/><br/>Alignment - big fan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460647/#Comment_460647" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-24T08:54:29+00:00" title="February 24, 2017  8:54AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yes, Alignment.

It could just as easily be Red/Blue/Green, which be more traditional in war gaming.<br/><br/>For those who aren't following, Red and Blue are traditional war game factions. They're generic stand ins for Side A, Side B in a scenario. ( I assume the choice of those colors  comes from the Napoleonic Wars, with Red associated with Britain and Blue associated with France).<br/><br/>A scenario might simply describe a set up like:<br/><br/><i>Red is advancing in march columns down the road which runs across the board with the goal of existing intact at the opposite end through the town of Braunstein on the western edge. Unbeknownst to Red, Advance elements of Blue's Advance guard have thrown up pickets east of Braunstein and have sent back word to Blue's main body, off the board west of Braunstein. As the sun rises, Blue's main body will be arriving piecemeal to throw up a more active defense in and around Braunstein.</i><br/><br/>For this, it doesn't matter who exactly Red and Blue represent, and to an extent, it doesn't matter what the war in question is. It's just a classic scenario.<br/><br/>In those games, occasionally you'd have a Side C, or Green. Green is usually a problem for both sides in some form, having their own goals which make them annoying as either allies or enemies, as appropriate. In a scenario, it would be set up already what Green's goals were, and everyone would have a fairly good idea why the other sides would find Green to be a pain in the butt.<br/><br/>In a campaign game where you get to choose your army's alignment, choosing Red or Blue gives the basic info to other members of Red or Blue, <i>Hey guys, I'm basically on your side. At most we might have some personality differences or slightly conflicting personal goals, but generally, we're sympatico.</i><br/><br/>Choosing Green could mean almost anything. You've likely got some personal goals outside of Red's and Blue's overall goals. And every Green player might have wildly different goals form one another, and maybe wildly different capabilities. If you're team Red or Blue, what you want is either to bring each Green entity/nation/faction over to your side, or, failing that, to keep them essentially inactive. You definitely don't want them to flip and join the other major faction, your enemies.<br/><br/>I'm sure you can see how some of this gets weird when you start to apply it to individuals, and when you throw in concepts of L/C, G/E.<br/>___________________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>Edited to add:<br/>Following up on the war game aspect a bit, old forms of D&amp;D were also set up to allow a for a kind of dual-level/parallel sot of war game campaign to be played, and integrated the two, especially in the context of something like a war game club.<br/><br/>The dyed in the wool war gamers could play a <i>Diplomacy</i>-esque war game, getting together sporadically to fight out the table top army versus army battles, with those players making alliances and betraying one another as needed, with alignment being a rough guide to that. If I was setting that up, all of the national/kingdom leaders would be fighters.<br/><br/>Going on simultaneously, you have the character players going around, doing loot-and-level operations, building their characters up as useful wild card mercenary types of any class they chose, leading their own small warbands, and offering their services to whatever leaders they wish as time goes on. Perhaps they hook up regularly on the side of one of those princely leaders who becomes a patron of sorts. Eventually, they can reach name level and choose to get ennobled/recognized and become warlords in their own right. Other times, they may show up at one of those Princely level battles as a hero/champion/unit leader, perhaps commanding their own force ( undoubtedly vastly better equipped and than your run of the mill army types) or at as assassins or magical back up for the Prince's regulars.<br/><br/>I haven't ever seen it played this way personally, but pretty much everything in early editions implies the existence of such a game type when viewed through war gamer eyes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460665/#Comment_460665" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-24T17:02:44+00:00" title="February 24, 2017  5:02PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2017 5:42PM by Airk.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some interesting stuff here, but nothing that sounds particularly exciting to me.  (Note: I don't have any antipathy towards D&amp;D, but neither do early editions hold any place of special magic for me.)<br/><br/>* Hit points as an abstraction are basically so bog standard at this point that I don't find anything of noteworthy value in them.<br/>* Hit dice have always seemed like a weird, awkward approximation because really, how many hit dice a monster has doesn't actually have very much coupling with how dangerous it is.  Later iterations of the game with the concept of "challenge rating" do this better, IMHO.<br/>* Maybe I'm ignorant, but I don't feel like there's that much uniqueness to the power curve either?  And actually, the power curve in D&amp;D is ALL OVER the place depending on what edition you are playing (Do you inexplicably stop gaining a meaningful amount of hitpoints at level 10?) what class you are (Sucks if you're a fighter, bro) and so on.<br/>* I do tend to forget about the social resolution system;  Actually, I'm not even sure if it was IN Mentzer.  I forget. It's been a long time. This may be one of the rules I am forgetting, but it also seems like one of the weirdest rules to value in a game about player skill.<br/>* I also disagree that the game has a large amount of randomized content. I mean, yeah, there are random encounters with 1d100 orcs or whatever, but the basic method I've understood to be used for this stuff since forever is the GM creates a dungeon.  In detail. With what's in each room (not just monsters, but like "this is the kitchen, and it has these features...") and possibly also custom wandering monster tables if he wants it to be anything resembling a coherent experience instead of "Okay, I guess the random encounter in this dungeon full of orcs is 2d4 fire beetles, because... I dunno, maybe they're pets?"  It has always seemed to require a fairly substantial amount of prep that could then be supplemented by random stuff.  Which to me is exactly how most other games that aren't on  horrible plot railroads work.  Not much of an achievement at all.<br/>* The game "structure" supports different types of play only with heavy kludging, IMHO;  It has all the same problems with drop-in-drop-out play that any other game has unless the party retreats out of the dungeon at the end of every session, which is neither implied nor obvious.  High and Low performance players are a historical source of friction.  One shots are dubiously supported and require all the usual sorts of awkwardness (pre-gen characters, etc.) I'm not seeing anything unique here at all.<br/>* I'm really not sure what you mean by a precedent-based approach to rules.  Isn't this basically GM fiat, only you're supposed to stick with it going forward?  I guess this is basically how I've always played with regard to edge cases, because it just seems like best practice (and also obvious - why would I want to fiat something different each time?) and therefore not that unique?<br/>* Alignment, to me, is kindof a failure, because it's completely up to the GM and the group to make it useful.  If there had been any sort of instructive text saying, I dunno "Make sure your party is composed of people of compatible alignments" it would be "useful" except for the fact that that's not really any better than saying "Make sure your group has reasons to work together" and is tied to a weird and potentially extremely problematic idea that people and races(!) have inherent goodness or badness.  And the game doesn't even do this - indeed, it more or less implies, even if just by admission, that you can pretty much choose whatever with respect to alignment, therefore defeating the only purpose I've ever found for it.  It's NOT a "simple social contract" because there's nothing in the text that makes it a social contract.  It's just a weird descriptor of your character.  Heck, the Moldvay rules explicitly say that players can pick whatever alignment they want, and they don't even have to TELL the other players what they picked.  How is this useful as some sort of social contract? <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460672/#Comment_460672" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-24T18:49:03+00:00" title="February 24, 2017  6:49PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fair enough.

The immense success of the one single game has played its part, but the end result is that there just aren't that many games similar to old-school D&amp;D in their deeper bits. (You might have better luck looking at wargames, in fact - I don't really know.) This, in part, supports the relevance of D&amp;D to this day: while one may argue that e.g. <i>Champions</i> has been superseded by progeny that captures its ideas better, D&amp;D definitely has not been. (Or it there is some game out there that totally supersedes it, do please let me know - I want to check it out.)</blockquote>\nI think Traveller 1977 (just the original 3 books, or the 1981 edition, The Traveller Book, or Starter Traveller) share some of these qualities.

I find it important to emphasize that my appreciation for the theoretical features of D&amp;D (the main ones of which I listed earlier) does not rise out of ignorance of modern design; rather, it is precisely because D&amp;D offers its own, alternative solutions to certain esoteric issues that I find it so interesting. The novelty factor alone becomes an immensely important thing once you've drawn all the inspiration you can from your current set of influences.<br/><br/>However, if another person is "working through" a different set of issues in their roleplaying, or developing games for different concerns, it is possible that the features of D&amp;D do not offer them particular insights. Like other artistic mediums and crafts, roleplaying is not linear, understanding does not grow sequentially. We travel, sometimes in circles.<br/><br/>This subjective perspective brings us to the idea that what matters in artistic influences is utility, not some kind of objective importance: if somebody gets value of out engaging with whatever, even old D&amp;D, then that thing is "important" because it helps them advance in their work. There is no need, and no way, to prove that importance generally, except by the simple statement: these are the things I need, and this thing has them in it.<br/><br/>So in that regard it's enough for me to have answered Airk's wondering about retroclone interest - at least for me, and other people in a similar creative place, it's pretty much the sort of things you see on my list. I don't need to convince you about these being interesting things on any personal level, right? It's enough for us to know what the points of interest are for somebody else, even if you don't see them as interesting yourself right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460677/#Comment_460677" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-24T20:38:03+00:00" title="February 24, 2017  8:38PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of retroclones also "fix" some particular "problem" the designer sees with some early edition of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I never particularly liked the multiple Save categories, and bemoaned the lack of skill system.

Although the scene does have a lot of nostalgia in it, I think that there are three other reasons, too, for why the retroclones resemble the original rules so much:<br/><br/><b>1)</b> The retroclone was originally created specifically to enable access to the old rules in a situation where it was difficult to get the original texts, at least legally.<br/><br/><b>2)</b> Often the retroclone is basically an assembled set of houserules from an avid player of D&amp;D. This does, predictably, mean that it's mostly the same as D&amp;D. This phenomenon is encouraged by the adaptation-predicated rules methodology of the game, and the fact that people want to retain cross-compatibility with other players of the same game. All this encourages limiting the "retro-clone" to minor forms of innovation rather than just making it entirely different. And of course, observation bias kicks in here: if the game text ends up <i>too</i> different from D&amp;D, we stop considering it a retroclone, and then it disappears off the radar <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/><b>3)</b> D&amp;D is, as discussed, very different from most roleplaying games. Somebody who wants to make a game that preserves its qualities will, necessarily, retain many of the distinctive features. In fact, if you're less than certain about what it <b>is</b> that entices you about D&amp;D, perhaps it's best to stick to it as much as possible? Just change the things you <i>know</i> annoy you, and keep the rest as is, so as to not lose the underlying excellence of the game.<br/><br/>Those, plus the nostalgia factor, explain the retroclone phenomenon pretty well, I think. Some of the clones are more about OGL-pirating the old texts, some are house rule compilations, while others are simply conservative game design careful to preserve the fundamentals. All of these motivations contribute to making the retroclones an endless parade of minor variations on the base D&amp;D texts.<br/><br/>(I'll note that I don't mind the retroclone phenomenon myself; I view it as one of the ways that the players of the game have for discussing house rules. There are stranger things under this sky than a parade of nigh-identical game texts, with differences that matter a great deal to the players of the game while being largely obscure for outsiders. It's like wine tasting, pretty much.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460685/#Comment_460685" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-24T23:10:39+00:00" title="February 24, 2017 11:10PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing that would be interesting, and maybe it's out there, is for each retro clone, a discussion of where it diverges from whatever early D&amp;D text it is supposed to be close to (OD&amp;D, OD&amp;D plus supplements, AD&amp;D, Holmes Basic D&amp;D, Moldvay Basic/Cook &amp; Marsh Expert, or Mentzer Basic/Expert/Companion/Master) and why it diverges.<br/><br/>Of course not everyone would realize where their text diverges...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460688/#Comment_460688" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-25T04:37:23+00:00" title="February 25, 2017  4:37AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was just thinking that I'd be quite interested in such a resource, if anyone knows of any.

It's just way too constrictive in its playstyle and design traditions to keep amusing them, and they want a palate cleanser.<br/><br/>I think in some ways, to appreciate why D&amp;D ( and its forerunners) are so radical, you also have to understand and appreciate mainstream war game design and playstyle, not just at the time D&amp;D was first published, but even down to the present.<br/><br/>( And yes, I am mostly focusing on miniatures war game design but there are also ways it's radical compared to hex'n'chit board war game design).<br/><br/>And yes, having played D&amp;D as a kid long before I had grounding in war game playstyle/design, I had a very different impression of what D&amp;D was supposed to be. My understanding was of something more like a heroic and more open version of CYOA books, crossed with a bit of common, off-the-shelf board game mechanics.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460694/#Comment_460694" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-25T15:01:14+00:00" title="February 25, 2017  3:01PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And that is, of course, exactly the tack chosen by TSR during that first decade or so when they figured out how to capitalize on the initial success of the game: D&amp;D would be <i>the</i> fantasy roleplaying game, the flagship of fantasy adventure. Essentially, the perfect game for playing out your <i>Lord of the Rings</i> fantasies. This doesn't make much sense in hindsight, speaking from a design perspective (it was always an ill fit, being designed as a command skirmish wargame), but in an essentially virgin marketplace D&amp;D apparently was the closest thing to shangrila in this matter. It was probably also the best choice marketing-wise, as a heroic game of "choose your own adventure" was exactly what the market craved.<br/><br/>Going beyond those superficial marketing decisions, though, and paying attention to the bits of the game that <i>don't</i> fit the adventure fantasy concept, I find an interesting sort of game that is evidently a roleplaying game as far as my own rpg theory is concerned (that is, it is played in a shared imaginative space), but it's also so very much a wargame: there is an in-built curiousity about "what would happen", and the game consists mostly of scenario negotiations and executions that merely happen to be embedded in a fantasy world. That wargame D&amp;D is the game I'm so excited about. I don't know if I really need to say it, but honestly, there are better games for pretending to be Legolas. Many, many better games. However, for whipping up a 10-vs-10 medieval skirmish combat with consistent simulation and realistic tactical decision-making, with a prep time of one minute, D&amp;D is at the absolute top of the rpg pyramid - I am aware of only a handful of rpgs where something like this is even considered part of the game's agenda.<br/><br/>I've never been hardcore on wargames, but I have dabbled a bit. I think it's a shame how the cultural connection between D&amp;D and its wargaming roots was severed so relatively quickly, considering things in hindsight. I think it'd be cool if we had a whole range of wargames with significant aspects played out in the theater of the imagination, using that referees and everything else rpgs have to offer. Where is the "Being Napoleon" game that puts one player at absolute first-person driver's seat, with everybody else refereeing an exquisite simulation of every aspect of the Napoleonic Wars?<br/><br/>(Hey, that's another nice rpg idea. That goes in the drawer.)<br/><br/>As things stand, wargaming has crystallized in place, and only occasionally rpg people take inspiration from some aspects of the old hobby. Games like the Engle Matrix stuff and <i>Executive Decision</i> sort of hint at the possibilities available in this field, but I've always felt myself somewhat incapable of taking advantage: the cultural gulf is too much, I don't know what I should read or play to inspire myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460695/#Comment_460695" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-25T16:23:23+00:00" title="February 25, 2017  4:23PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>And that is, of course, exactly the tack chosen by TSR during that first decade or so when they figured out how to capitalize on the initial success of the game: D&amp;D would be <i>the</i> fantasy roleplaying game, the flagship of fantasy adventure.

I grew up playing it in the 80s and 90s, so I wasn't there from the very early days (I started playing in 86) but it definitely worked well for fantasy adventure from where I was standing. So did many other games of course. <br/><br/>Also, I think perhaps most importantly here, it succeeded. People accepted it as the goto fantasy RPG. Maybe those people were deluded or, more plausibly, it gave them the fantasy experience they desired. At a certain point you have to explain the game's popularity over time. Part of it is certainly being the first. That is always a huge advantage. And part of being first, also meant they got to define what fantasy RPG meant in the first place.<br/><br/>But I think there is also something about the game that allowed it to function well over sustained fantasy adventure campaigns. I think it also embraced being a different medium from the source material and leaned on things that worked week to week. Honestly it wasn't until the mid-90s or so, when D&amp;D and a lot of other RPGs started really trying to emulate the mediums the inspirational material came from, that I first began experiencing problems running the game (and once I ignored that, and embraced the medium, it worked fine again).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460696/#Comment_460696" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-25T17:51:29+00:00" title="February 25, 2017  5:51PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You misunderstand a little bit, Brendan: I did not claim that D&amp;D does not work as an adventure game, I merely observed that today there are games that are, at least for me, more intuitively fitting for fulfilling that creative need. Meanwhile, I do not think that it is the most natural fit for D&amp;D, the game's so full of stuff that I wouldn't want anywhere near my "I want to be Legolas" game of choice. I mean, what's heroically adventurous about forgetting to buy and pack a lantern - or worse still, taking the time to pack carefully and then dying in the first random encounter? I think it's obvious that the game actively militates against certain creative desires it nevertheless markets towards, and this is due to its wargame roots.<br/><br/>Insofar as the success of D&amp;D goes, I personally think that first mover advantage just about explains it. Note that it's the success of <i>other</i> games that bolsters this analysis: if D&amp;D's success was really about it being the most excellent game, the game that is all things to everybody, then how <i>did</i> e.g. GURPS ever find an audience against such a massively dominant market competitor? My explanation is that GURPS genuinely does some things better.<br/><br/>Those rhetorical points aside, I agree with you about D&amp;D having qualities that make it a feasible fantasy adventure chassis. It's not an <i>insane</i> proposition by any means that TSR came up with in that regard - as so often is the case in the Internet, one needs to emphasize that saying that D&amp;D is better as a wargame than a "be Legolas" game does not mean that it's the absolutely shittiest game ever for the latter purpose. It just means that it's comparatively not optimal. And it was still the best of a rather narrow field of alternatives at the time it was published.<br/><br/>Some clear examples of things that D&amp;D does well to support an adventurous wish-fulfillment, a "choose your own adventure" style game of heroic derring-do:<br/><b>*</b> The leveling system gives a mechanical arc of development from "zero to hero", which is a legit adventure story conceit even if the original xp rules are nowhere near optimal for the purpose.<br/><b>*</b> The game's fictional elements are all the same as you'd get in a romantic high fantasy - it's full of wizards, dragons, valiant knights (well, it's not difficult to skin your fighting man as one), elves, dwarves and so on. So it's already about the <i>topic</i>.<br/><b>*</b> The hit point system, accumulation of gear and the magic system actually give players a modicum of heroic agency at higher levels; their characters are actually somewhat capable of acting in ways resonant with romantic fantasy adventure. (At least as long as you don't encounter a save or die, of course.)<br/><br/>I personally believe that these correspondences are sort of accidents, because the original game text and what I've heard of the early play all indicates to me that it was not "I wanna be Legolas" that was driving the creative process at first. Nevertheless, it was the fact that the game could be viewed in this light that encouraged TSR to market it that way. I can easily see how it was the more appealing choice, if the alternative was to give it a trade dress as a wargame and sell it as one. "Fun for all ages 22 years up, only men need apply.

Before I do I think there are a couple things to bring to the front of the discussion (most of which has been brought up in some way already, but deserves focus).<br/><br/>1. Subjectivity. Pretty much everything suffers from it. There probably are NO objective truths in anything we're talking about. Only varying degrees of couched, parametricized, and warranted subjective preferences. As such it's important to remember that the question isn't 'which mechanics ARE good/interesting/unique/useful', but instead 'which mechanics do YOU FIND good/interesting/unique/useful'.<br/><br/>2. Goals. A thing only 'is' good or bad in so much as it serves to achieve a limited goal in limited ways. This is a subset of subjectivity, but I think deserves special mention in the context of this thread. What I'm meaning is that if someone says mechanic x is good or bad, what they're saying is that it seems good or bad to them as a means to achieve some specific end that they find favorable or unfavorable, and that opinion is likely formed as a result of experiences which may or may not have validity. Which leads us directly to number three.<br/><br/>3. Bias. Pretty much everything suffers from it. Nearly everything we talk about is probably going to be tainted by our overall experiences and perceptions...both in general and specifically. As such those with generally positive experiences will be able to point to specifics in a more favorable light, while those with generally negative opinions will critique more harshly. As always, any time we can transpose those (a person who loves the game pointing out flaws, or one who hates it pointing out gem flecks) it should deserve special consideration as likely significant.<br/><br/>4. Place in history (both broad to narrow, and narrow to broad. While I agree that, for the purposes of this discussion, it's beneficial to go beyond 'it was first' or 'it was the only', I think it really is beyond important to acknowledge. By sheer virtue of this fact almost every single mechanic and aspect deserves a certain level of reverence and respect. If you would argue otherwise then you're essentially claiming that Wright Brothers or da Vinci had no interesting or meaningful mechanics either (because after all, every single aspect of flight is better now, and more successfully accomplishes any given goal within that general field). No...EVERYTHING about D&amp;D is amazing for this reason alone.<br/><br/>Ok, so with all that said and done, here's some things that I love about early versions of D&amp;D (say BECMI/RC or 1st edition AD&amp;D). I'm only talking about each one briefly, but since I've spent so much time analyzing them in the past for game design elements I can extrapolate where necessary.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*D4, D6, D8, D%, etc - Yes, these existed before D&amp;D, but their inclusion as a set to achieve random results of nearly any subset of numbers is nothing short of genius without which there would be no traditional rpgs. Yes, there are pluses to systems using only one type of die as well, and there are other systems that required sets which came after, but the idea to have the entire set (and to use them all BOTH generally and specifically) is iconically D&amp;D.<br/><br/>*3D6 attribute generation - The infusion of normal distribution into character creation is astoundingly brilliant and central to the nature of D&amp;D as a somewhat statistically valid simulationist experience. After all, D&amp;D is as much about math as it is about storytelling.<br/><br/>*Class system - The idea to have one's role within the group generalized like this is fantastic. Not that skill based systems (or other types of games) are any less awesome, but it's an entirely different concept. The wargaming roots of it are glaringly obvious, and bring a multitude of limitations and flaws...but it also creates an experience which is largely uncapturable outside of a class-based system. In fact, I appreciate it so much that I've been lukewarm or even hostile to skill sub-systems and feat sub-systems being included in D&amp;D as a result. To do so completely alters the experience. Either be a class-based game, or don't...hybrids muddy the purpose.<br/><br/>*THAC0 - So first off, it wasn't done as well as it could have been to achieve its goals. Admitted. However, it came close enough that given the utility of a universal mechanic of this sort I'll let it slide. Variance by class, improvement through experience gain, etc...this is just a nifty idea without which you fail to achieve the flavor of an early D&amp;D game.<br/><br/>*Name Level - The entire concept of reaching a level of renown and skill at which you gain holdings to administer, and pretty much every aspect of that (followers, strongholds, etc)...just about brings a tear to my eye. Very few other games attempt to run the gamut from penniless vagabond to king and even to eventual immortality. In early D&amp;D it's not merely an option, it's damn near integral.<br/><br/>*Box set tiers - This is the whole Basic/Expert/Companion/Master/Immortal breakdown. While it was likely done more for costs, time and business reasons it actually lays the groundwork for some vital differences in gameplay that sadly never fully materialized into a coherent framework. I think it's one of the greatest losses between D&amp;D and AD&amp;D.<br/><br/>*Weapon Mastery - I'll be in my bunk.<br/><br/>*Immortality - Still in my bunk, but now so is the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader squad.<br/><br/>*Dwarven anti-magic - The idea that dwarves are inherently resistive to magical energy is pretty fascinating. It blends so well with the whole 'enduring creatures of the earth' thing. Again, this was never developed enough, and I think it evolved in the wrong direction entirely. Within the early editions, however, it's a mechanic that reinforced the flavor/story brilliantly.<br/><br/>*Training requirements - HELL YES! It's something so obvious and yet most non-simulationist games completely ignore it. In a class based game where increased skill/aptitude is the point the manner of those gains is intrinsically tied to the greater story. This is essentially the 80's cinematic training montage of RPGs.<br/><br/>*Racial attribute modifiers - This is one that's absolutely central to game flavor, but that never was fully evolved into what it should have been. Even so, D&amp;D isn't D&amp;D without mechanically different races.<br/><br/>*Age attribute modifiers - Often ignored by many, this helped reinforce the simulationist flavor of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>*Gender attribute modifiers - Definitely the worst handled of the three attribute modifications, it still offered an important aspect that could have been far better developed with more attention.<br/><br/>*Class specific spell lists - Ok, this one is a serious double edged sword. I can lump all the negatives into the greater failings of the magic system on the whole though, which leaves just the value of reinforcing the unique class system. I've seen systems where magic is unified, and those work too. However they don't work to reinforce the class/role nature of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>*Level titles - This is more about flavor and story than mechanics, but when you see it as tying in to the box set tiers and name levels and so on I thought it deserved special mention. I think it was developed badly, but there's a kernel of greatness here that's only realized in some homebrews that focus on it and tie it directly to mechanics.<br/><br/>*M/S/V components - Well...crap. *heads back to bunk* I'm gonna need some lotion if this keeps up.<br/><br/>...to be continued                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460699/#Comment_460699" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-25T18:08:00+00:00" title="February 25, 2017  6:08PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *Grandmaster of Flowers - This actually covers all the classes that have limited numbers of higher level members. This inherent competitiveness and limitation is incredibly indicative of the type of gaming experience early D&amp;D was going for. I don't know many other games that have ever explored this idea. The only caveat is that it was never fully explored, except in some home games.<br/><br/>*Alignment - This is a phenomenal accomplishment, and one of those things that remains absolutely central to the game regardless of edition. Lose this, it's no longer D&amp;D. If you want to see just how elegant and functional it is take a look at some of the other attempts at alignment in other early game systems (Palladium...oh dear God Palladium). Did it have problems? Absofreakinglutely. Did interpretations of the alignments change over time (and with good reason)? Posifrakingtively. Still, the core concept and integration into the system is a cornerstone.<br/><br/>*Bard colleges - Silently weeping for this loss. Seriously, this was such a great foundation to the Bard class. With work it can become an excellent addition to any D&amp;D experience. Especially when you take it from mere flavor and begin adding mechanical impacts.<br/><br/>*Random lists - Random (statistics) is D&amp;D, and D&amp;D IS random/statistics. It's a simulationist experience, and these are the kinds of things that made it possible.<br/><br/>*Mundane treasures - This is one of those things that forms a tiny part of what might have been. In this case, the potential for a fantastic economic sub-system to the game. While there's also value in a simple representative or aggregate system (be it gold pieces or a wealth attribute) this one fits so beautifully into what D&amp;D was...a combination of detail elements and mathematics to enrich the telling of stories.<br/><br/>*XP - Simple. Powerful. Flexible. Iconic. There's a reason so many other games (and not just RPGs) utilize similar systems.<br/><br/>*Non-combat XP awards - While never fleshed out the way it should have been, the inclusion of various ways to improve in class (treasure value, roleplaying, story goal achievement, etc) was essential to prevent the game being nothing more than hack n slash.<br/><br/>*Spell scarcity &amp; acquisition - This is another of those things that's bittersweet due to the failure to completely nail the magic system. Still, it's an enormously important aspect of the game that i've noticed an alarming number of tables ignores.<br/><br/>*Relics &amp; Intelligent magic items - Still another unevolved seed of greatness. This one was developed just enough to make it viable, while being minor enough to not have to figure in to many campaigns (which also reinforces many of the core aspects of the game in a positive way). <br/><br/>*Reversible spells - Another hashmark in the 'magic system that could have been' column, it was nevertheless a great include.<br/><br/>*Morale system - Certainly more of a wargaming thing it still served an important function in the RPG. I'm amazed by how many games have no consideration of such things in their systems. Especially ones that are supposed to have other simulationist elements.<br/><br/>*Segments/rounds/turns - Perhaps overly complex it still added elements that many other games lacked.<br/><br/>*Hit Points - A super elegant and simple representation of combat. Yes, there's a lot to be said for more specific wound systems, but as a means to keep things approachable and flowing this was nearly without peer. Definitely needs tweaking, but it was a phenomenal starting point.<br/><br/>*Weapon speed - In a simulationist game I just can't imagine a way to leave this out. While it suffers the weaknesses of being tied in to other sub-systems with their own problems, overall it worked well and lent an enormous amount to the experience.<br/><br/>*AC - Just like XP or HPs this is about as iconic as you can get to the game. Just like those other systems, it could have been developed better. Still, as a simple representation of a VERY complex topic it worked as well as anything I've ever seen.<br/><br/>*Weapon vs Armor Type - I know I'll get roasted for this one, but it's honestly fundamental to the game experience. It needs reworking to be useable, but since the point is a simulationist experience you simply can't forego it and still get the full experience.<br/><br/>*Infravision - Actually meaning all the different sensory systems...infravision, ultravision, low-light, etc. It was another thing that could be finicky and cause issues in the game, but it added quite a bit if you took the time to really think about it.<br/><br/>*Encumbrance - Again, simulation over fiat, which is the original D&amp;D experience. Together with movement speeds and some of the random rules (like drawing weapons, finding potions in packs, etc) this was vitally important to the system. It's one of those things that has been expertly refined in other systems since, but remains important to the original.<br/><br/>*Rule 0 - If nothing else made people want to puke on their monitors I'm sure this just did. It's a binary threshold in my experience. Either you require this, or you deny it. No in between. Since I've put it in this list you can deduce where I fall on the subject.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I could honestly just reprint the PHB &amp; DMG, since D&amp;D remains my all time favorite game and hobby. I openly acknowledge my supreme bias of the topic, but also remind people that given the earlier caveats (subjectivity, goals, etc) its almost a tautology that D&amp;D is almost perfectly D&amp;Dish.<br/><br/>If you want something unlike D&amp;D, then the mechanics probably don't suit you as well (obviously). For those of us who WANT a class-based simulationist framework to experience our stories in, the game continues to work surprisingly well. In fact, properly tweaked to best serve individual warrants I have never found anything that comes even remotely close to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460700/#Comment_460700" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-25T18:11:16+00:00" title="February 25, 2017  6:11PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You misunderstand a little bit, Brendan: I did not claim that D&amp;D does not work as an adventure game, I merely observed that today there are games that are, at least for me, more intuitively fitting for fulfilling that creative need. Meanwhile, I do not think that it is the most natural fit for D&amp;D, the game's so full of stuff that I wouldn't want anywhere near my "I want to be Legolas" game of choice. I mean, what's heroically adventurous about forgetting to buy and pack a lantern - or worse still, taking the time to pack carefully and then dying in the first random encounter? I think it's obvious that the game actively militates against certain creative desires it nevertheless markets towards, and this is due to its wargame roots.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nBut my point was you are tying it to what you expect from fantasy adventure. For you, it means emulating the source material and the medium of the source material (at least that is what it sounds like). What D&amp;D does well is it can support a wide range of fantasy adventure experiences. It isn't going to perfectly fit LotR, but it can incorporate elements of Lord of the Rings easily. It can also incorporate elements of A Princess of Mars or Three Hearts and Three Lions. It isn't a game that guarantees you can be legolas, because it is true to the medium of being a game (so death is on the table). This was my point about the shift in the 90s creating a lot of problems for D&amp;D. You want to be Legolas and because D&amp;D doesn't provide that, your claim is D&amp;D isn't well suited for fantasy adventure. But I think that is a pretty narrow way to look at it, and it is one that ignores the medium D&amp;D belongs to. A lot of people want a game where you can bring in elements from Lord of the Rings, but they still want it to be a game and not predictable in terms of outcomes. D&amp;D supports the Legolas element in so much as you can have an elf character and the GM could have an elf NPC based specifically on Legolas. I am not saying there aren't games better suited to what you are looking for. But what you are looking for is not the full spectrum of what Fantasy Adventure RPG means. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460701/#Comment_460701" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-25T18:33:38+00:00" title="February 25, 2017  6:33PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get your point, Brendan, and it's a good one.

That wargame D&amp;D is the game I'm so excited about. I don't know if I really need to say it, but honestly, there are better games for pretending to be Legolas. Many, many better games. However, for whipping up a 10-vs-10 medieval skirmish combat with consistent simulation and realistic tactical decision-making, with a prep time of one minute, D&amp;D is at the absolute top of the rpg pyramid - I am aware of only a handful of rpgs where something like this is even considered part of the game's agenda.</blockquote>\nI guess I'm REALLY not grasping what makes early D&amp;D a good "wargame" game.  The relative paucity of rules to me is an obstacle here, because it's extremely difficult to make informed or interesting tactical decisions, since so much of it basically hinges on whatever the GM decides.  There aren't actually really any tactical options since by default there isn't a battlemap, and all the "special things" are confined to spells.  Sure, maybe your GM will give you +2 to hit if you jump up on a table, but maybe he won't.  There isn't even really any discussion of the structure of this sort of thing.  If I want a wargame, I want a clear sense of how things work that D&amp;D doesn't really give me in its earlier editions. <br/><br/>To me, early D&amp;D is more of a survival game than a wargame. It's about being prepared, it's about being cautious, it's about not fighting if you can avoid it, and it's about exploiting the fictional situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460705/#Comment_460705" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-25T22:10:22+00:00" title="February 25, 2017 10:10PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2017 10:11PM by adamwb.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About half of book three is taken up with rules about hirelings, castles, morale, naval combat involving pre written orders and simultaneous movement, command control distances, evasion based on group size, etc. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I think that leaping on the table and asking for a plus is very much part of the move towards heroic play.

It's more like, <i>Hey we're above the ogre's cave and it shows rocks on the map. Can we rig up a lever, get the ogre to come outside and then roll a rock down on his head? How does that work?</i><br/><br/>That's big, I mean, really huge.<br/><br/>And for war gamers, it's a big deal. In your average WW2 war game, taking your mortar platoon mounted in jeeps and close assaulting that Panzer section is pretty much suicide in any game you'd like to name. <br/><br/>Yet, I know a story of guys who did exactly that in real life and won. Why? Because they acted like PCs in an RPG. They took their spare gasoline cans ( not their mortars or small arms),snuck up on the tanks at night, doused the tanks in gas and lit them up.<br/><br/>That's the kind of thing that D&amp;D let you do, with that rules light, GM decision heavy play.<br/><br/>Old war gamers are maybe a little more flexible than the more calcified war gamers of today. They could take no for an answer and go on, or risk and gamble on long odds.<br/><br/>More rules really weren't better. It's more to learn, more moving parts to deal with, and much higher chance that some rules interaction creates a Murphy's Rules situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460707/#Comment_460707" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-26T01:36:38+00:00" title="February 26, 2017  1:36AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess this disrupts what I think of when I think of a 'Wargame'.

The players establish a team, equipment, strategic and tactical objectives, and the referee sets those up for the opposition, too. Then the scenario they set up is gamed, to see how it goes and to make any necessary judgement calls midway. The milieu is fantasy-medieval, with fighting-men and magic-users as the main operational resources, and goblins, traps and dragons as the sorts of things you may expect for opposition.<br/><br/>Look at that description. How is that not a war game? The fact that the game uses nigh-revolutionary methods of play (although by no means entirely unique; referees and fog of war are known from more elaborate wargames) doesn't make it a not-wargame, although it <i>may</i> mean that some people won't like it as a wargame because they're used to wargames handling differently. Nevertheless, it's a wargame in the sense of being in the general medium and engaging the creative challenges that wargames deal with. It would perhaps be appropriate to compare to live-action roleplaying: D&amp;D is wargaming in the same sense that larping is roleplaying. (Which is to say, not everybody thinks that it is, but most do; it depends on what you think is at the heart of the form.)<br/><br/>Regarding tactical decision-making, D&amp;D has plenty of it. It's just not encoded into the rules, which is actually not that uncommon for old-fashioned wargames. I mean, where are the encoded decisions in a game that gives you rules for moving Napoleonic regiments and resolving charges? You're presumably going to use those rules for a whole scenario where <i>you</i> decide where those regiments move and who they charge, which is where the decision-making comes in, but none of those things are in the rules: the rules just tell you how to move and how to charge.<br/><br/>(This is actually about a wider issue that concerns the whole form of wargaming: is the game about simulating a situation and gaming it out, or is it about providing a fun boardgame that has a historical theme? If the former, then it is entirely normal that the game's rules do not encode and ensure particular tactical choices and challenges. If the latter, then the game has to provide its own abstract game of skill, with the background world relegated into mere color. It's not just D&amp;D where one may question the game's nature, all wargames may be similarly challenged for their lack of, well, in-built game.)<br/><br/>Similarly in D&amp;D the rules tell you how to move and attack, but it does not particularly ensure that there are meaningful tactical choices involved in those decisions, because it plainly assumes that these choices will emerge from the way those rules are applied to the simulated environment. Once you add the rest of the ingredients you get many tactical choices such as whether to attack or retreat (turn by turn, note), try to hold a chokepoint (notably, the original text is silent about in-melee movement; it assumes that the referee handles it), when to cast your spells or other special attacks and who to attack. And that's just in immediate combat, and without doing anything actually innovative (which the game supports fully, thanks to the presence of a referee empowered to resolve a variety of stratagems on the spot).<br/><br/>In our D&amp;D session last Wednesday the party, composed of three fighters, an architect and six henchmen, encountered 14 deep goblins (nasty Aztec-like underground-dwellers). They had opted for a careful and methodical advance into the dungeon, which is generally the wrong choice against a sentient and organized opponent; the goblins had time to heed the warning of their guards and gather themselves into a phalanx of sorts, with the club-wielding warrior nobility in the back line to encourage the spearmen. The adventuring party consisted mostly of soldiers as well, but they had a variety of weapons and combat styles, which made for a bad matchup with the zealous, disciplined goblins crowding them. The fact that the engagement occurred on long stairs (nevertheless classically 10 feet wide) helped reduce the mobility of the phalanx, of course, but the adventurers still had a hard time of it.<br/><br/>This being the core content of play in this game we're discussing (is it - I think it is), <i>of course</i> there is a veritable stream of small and great tactical decisions to be made everywhere in it. The players need to choose how they arm themselves, whether they use formations of some sort, where they move, who they attack and so on. The narrow tunnels cause confusion and make orderly action imperative; as morale starts to crack, even a single panicking warrior can cause inordinate difficulties for the rest as they struggle mindlessly to get out of the way of the enemy. In my experience the main reason for why some tactical choice is <i>not</i> present is that the fog of war curtails the decision-making ability, reducing players to raw guesses when intelligence fails; this, too, is a legit part of a wargame.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460714/#Comment_460714" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-26T14:22:09+00:00" title="February 26, 2017  2:22PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I guess this disrupts what I think of when I think of a 'Wargame'.  At that point, I don't really feel like you ARE playing a wargame anymore. <br/><br/>Which is I guess is sortof the point? It's not a wargame anymore, it's an RPG.  But at that point, you are also scratching, for me, a completely different itch.<br/></blockquote>\nThat's exactly the attitude of many 1970s war gamers when D&amp;D came out and started gaining a following. RPGs became a separate hobby, not because they broke out, but because they were kicked out.<br/><br/>You'll still find some of those old grognards around who feel that way.<br/><br/>Wargames cover a vast array of approaches, but only a very narrow band of design approaches has been commercially successful, and only a narrow band of that has become really successful.<br/><br/>Check here for some freebie insight into other approaches:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.wargamedevelopments.org/Wargame%20Developments%20Handbook.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wargamedevelopments.org/Wargame Developments Handbook.pdf</a><br/><br/>Eero's comparison to a fantasy-themed commando raid is pretty accurate, at least on the dungeon scale of things. I know people today tend to compare this older stuff to Heist films, but it has a much or more in common with commando movies and TV shows predating D&amp;D. Stuff like <i>Rat Patrol </i>on TV or <i>The Guns of Navarone </i>and <i>The Dirty Dozen </i>at the theater. For a more modern example,<i> The Heavy Water War</i> (playing on Netflix) hits a similar style.<br/><br/>That kind of thing doesn't necessarily work very well with your average war game rules as written. Large amounts of the plots of those involve all kinds of stuff that "colors outside of the lines", the kind of thing you want to have a GM there to make calls on.<br/><br/>Eero didn't mention it, but there's also the campaign aspect. In very rough war game terms, a campaign is just a series of linked battles, where the results of one battle has a knock on effect in other battles. It's often very hard to actually pull this off with war game rules as commonly written, but military history buffs also know there are some kinds of games that only make sense in a historical results context if you can get some kind of effect like that. This is especially true in heavily lopsided conflicts (asymmetric warfare) if the initially weaker side is to have any chance of winning over the long haul.<br/><br/>D&amp;D actually does this pretty seamlessly with the inbuilt character advancement over multiple sessions*, but also the old modules act a bit like mini-campaigns in themselves when viewed through the war game lens.<br/><br/>(*Some games certainly do have rules for units becoming more competent over the course of play as they gain bitter experience on the battlefield.)<br/><br/><br/>Then there's an undercurrent of Grognards, or a portion of them, feeling that "Toy Soldier Games" are just a bit...juvenile. That would be the most common type of commercially successful war game. Think Warhammer 40K and similar. It isn't juvenile because of subject matter ( although historical gamers often think that too) or the toys, but because 1 on 1 to toy soldier games leave out tons of the challenges of a commander at the represented level, or deal with them really poorly.<br/><br/>Having a ref there, and one in particular playing the opposition neutrally, is a quick fix for lots of those interesting, challenging, missing elements. It really isn't until decent computer wargames start coming along with lots of FoW and C3 problems programmed in that you see another option than a human ref to handle that stuff well.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Also, Eero:<br/>I don't know if you're aware, but there has been a big debate among war gamers over the years about "Game" vs. "Simulation". A feisty debate, on par with anything about GNS. It's funny, if you weren't aware of this, that your post pretty much nails the essence of it exactly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460727/#Comment_460727" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-27T04:28:04+00:00" title="February 27, 2017  4:28AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2017 4:36AM by Paul_T.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For those who aren't understanding the "wargame" comparison, here's another way to look at it:<br/><br/>* One view of a "wargame" is a tactical battle of wits where the rules determine the "possible moves", and you try to outmaneuver your opponent. (e.g. Chess)<br/><br/>D&amp;D is clearly not like that. The moves aren't defined nearly clearly enough to create an effective competitive strategy game. (Except for 4th Edition, perhaps.)<br/><br/>* Another view is the "wargames" as played by military commanders in training (possibly throughout history!). You take on the role of one side of the battle, and another player takes on the part of an impartial "referee", whose job it is to make rulings and to bring their knowledge and experience to bear on the game as it develops. <br/><br/>The expertise of a smart "referee" is considered, in this paradigm, to be entirely superior to any existing ruleset.<br/><br/>That is the type of "wargame" which D&amp;D is perhaps derived or evolved from. Looking at it that way, the lack of rules in certain areas - and incredibly strong focus on rules in other areas - suddenly makes a great deal of sense.<br/><br/>I'm going to take a wild guess that this is related to the "Game"/"Simulation" debate.<br/><br/>However, my favourite take on D&amp;D is the variant where the player roles are asymmetrical: the referee (DM) is attempting to present a "Simulationist" view of the game world (although somewhat selectively: at least, where it is possible to do so without reducing the game into an un-fun proposition - most D&amp;D groups aren't interested in accurately simulating wounds and infection, for example, nor settings where there are no monsters nor treasure), by crafting logical sequences of cause and effect in order to create a sequence of gameplay. Meanwhile, the players are equally committed to the "reality" of the imagined fiction/setting, but doing their best to perform competitively <i>within its limitations</i>.<br/><br/>It might be considered "good sportsmanship" at some tables, for example, to play within the limitations of your character's intelligence or knowledge (e.g. your character doesn't know that it is possible to create gunpowder, or the formula for doing so). In such a group, the limitation of avoiding out-of-character knowledge is accepted <i>precisely because</i> it makes it more challenging to play the game, and the players enjoy that particular challenge. (Much in the same way that I would accept the rule not to use my hands in a game of soccer, whether the other team can see it or not.)<br/><br/>I'm not familiar with the debate, but my guess is that such a more nuanced view might obviate the debate entirely (although it may still come up on minor matters, such as whether the group finds Armor vs. Weapon modifiers interesting, or not).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460729/#Comment_460729" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-27T04:43:14+00:00" title="February 27, 2017  4:43AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2017 4:46AM by Paul_T.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An example of the kind of thing I regularly see coming up in old-school D&amp;D games which rarely (if ever) happens in other RPGs:\n<blockquote>Kelaro started with zero equipment and several gold.

He's got the wealth, can put together plots that help out everyone, has vision and charisma. He'd be running the place shortly.</blockquote>\nFrom <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20985/epic-amazing-thing-d-d-5e-city-of-brass" rel="nofollow">Adam Dray's "City of Brass" thread</a>.<br/><br/>I find the particular elements brought up by various folks in this thread pretty interesting to read, because almost none of the ones mentioned so far are of particular interest *to me* (except in a historical context, of course, where they <i>all</i> are).<br/><br/>Rather, it's the principles behind the application of those rules or mechanics which - to me - form the core of old-school D&amp;D play. I don't care if there is a single Saving Throw Roll or six categories; what I find fascinating is the way that quick and simple, randomized character generation and common character death creates a very particular relationship between players and characters. (Specifically, the ability to create a new character from scratch makes it easy to begin again, and the randomness adds some excitement to the process - ok, you lost your character, but maybe this one will be even better, or make up for the last one's limitations? Meanwhile, the XP rules and the development of the character's history and personality all push you to develop an attachment to the persona and to try to keep him or her alive. A very interesting dynamic, which I see very few other RPGs replicate.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460730/#Comment_460730" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-27T04:46:11+00:00" title="February 27, 2017  4:46AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2017 4:51AM by Paul_T.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another note:<br/><br/>I didn't really understand the phenomenon of retroclones until I realized that part of the appeal was the hypothetical goal of a "lingua franca" which would allow people to share house rules, monsters, treasure, and adventures.<br/><br/>That contributes to the desire to keep your rules *as close as possible* to old texts and other people's retroclones: sure, you want to put your own stamp on the thing (no one wants to simply copy another text), but you prize retroactive compatibility because you want to make sure you can play that adventure your friend found in the "used books" bin.

I'll take your recommendation on it!<br/><br/>As a side-note, I've seen a few OSR folks make a point of standardizing "Hit Dice" as a rule for monster statistics which approaches the T&amp;T model (as I understand it), to various extents.<br/><br/>They relate a monster's hit points, AC, ThAC0, saving throws, damage, and other vital statistics directly to HD. This means that monster "details" can become very streamlined - if you accept many of those statistics as abstract measures of danger or threat, it's a pretty natural assumption. This means you can write a monster's "stat block" as consisting of a Hit Die number and some fictional description, then simply reference those other statistics in play from a chart. Very elegant, and, in many cases, totally sensible.

(Kidding. Mostly I just think about this stuff before I fall nicely asleep.) I like to call it "linearizing the statistics", because the base conceit is about interpreting everything as flowing to and from a single number.<br/><br/>I've ultimately come to the conclusion that while HD can serve as the default basis for hit points (obviously), attack bonus and saves (as it does), the armor class is one thing that cannot and should not be linearized under the D&amp;D's mechanical context. The way I've solved that for my personal "stat block format" is that I've dropped AC from the stat block and instead just give an in-fiction description of the defensive abilities, which I'll then reconvert into AC in the moment when it's needed. In effect, AC joins all the "special qualities" of a monster in the description block, leaving HD as the single relevant numerical descriptor of a monster.<br/><br/>(What do I win by doing this? Mainly strict adherence to conservation of detail, which is a cornerstone principle of my D&amp;D development anyway; a big starting point for my starting to fiddle with the D&amp;D rules in the first place was an attempt to reduce the clutter and lay down a precise framework for how much and what kind of mechanical detail is utilized in the procedures of play. This is why character sheets grow bigger as characters gain levels in my homebrew rules - you literally gain a "budget of mechanical consideration" as you grow in levels and become a more important character for the campaign.)<br/><br/>I should also mention that the "attack routine" (how many attacks and how much damage) is another default element that cannot be linearised into HD. Once you've swallowed the idea of dropping an explicit AC listing, though, it's no big deal - just read it off the descriptive portion like you do with AC.<br/><br/>The end result is exactly as Paul says, a one-number monster stat block. Here's an example:<br/><br/><b>Ghoul, 2 HD</b><br/>Ghouls are malnourished semi-undead humans ridden by a cursed appetite for human flesh. Most are cunning, some are truly intelligent. They are both more robust (+1 to AC) and more agile (+1 to AC) than humans, but are otherwise similar (base AC 20). They can attack ferociously with both claws (normal damage) and by biting (half damage), and do not use weapons, armor or tools of civilization. Ghoul claws and fangs carry a paralyzing agent, save or become immobile for a while.<br/><br/>The description block can run a ways, obviously - ghouls, for example, have seen a lot of play over the years, and thus there's a lot of minutiae in my head that comes into play when I run them. Nevertheless, there is technically speaking only one mechanical number relevant to them, everything else is fictional detail that provides circumstantial mechanizations where relevant. I added some mechanical numbers in parenthesis in the above example to pin-point where the information is, but technically speaking it's all a fictional description first, and it only becomes mechanical conceits via referee decision. The rule is that "thick skin" gives you a +1 to AC, not that ghouls have AC this or that - you get a thin-skinned ghoul (perhaps somebody who became a ghoul just recently), you get one with a lower AC.<br/><br/>Out of academic interest, it should be noted that <i>Tunnels &amp; Trolls</i> has its own version of the linearization conundrum. While the game has a very primal mechanical environment for monsters, the concept of special mechanical monster powers <i>does</i> exist. For example, a Basilisk in T&amp;T might have the special power of trading in three spite damage dice to instead turn one enemy combatant to stone. The existence of these kinds of mechanical special maneuvers implies that the T&amp;T stat block might in fact consist of three elements instead of two: there's the Monster Rating (MR) and monster description, but one could also argue that there is a list of note-worthy special abilities on top of that. (In practice these are of course described in the monster description, but as the special rules in question are generally quite abstract and game-mechanical privileges, it might make more sense to separate them out from the fluff to give them more emphasis.)<br/><br/>But anyway, enough about that - I can imagine how pointless this minutiae looks like for somebody who doesn't practice the game.

The general run of war game rules are to create a game in which either side has an equal chance of winning, given the vagaries of luck and skill between two opponents. It's competitive, 1 on 1, and rules need to cover all possible moves and be clearly understood  by both players to be fair to both players.<br/><br/>The thing is, after a certain point, this style of play is limited in its ability to represent things that the commander (of the level represented by the player) on the field must deal with. Attempting to add rules for those things often makes the game unwieldy in complexity.<br/><br/>The big problems involve: <br/>Perfect Intelligence<br/>Perfect Command/Communication/Control ( C3)<br/>Predictable Movement Rates, Morale, and Combat results<br/>Isolation of the battle being played from outside events and broader goals<br/><br/>Those things are fine for 1 on 1 competitive clash, maybe even desirable. They aren't a bad starting ( what I meant by "juvenile") introduction to war gaming.<br/><br/>After a while though, there are certain sorts of war gamers who desire a bit more chaos and challenge. Very often history nerds especially become fascinated by the battles where wildly unpredictable events throw everything into chaos and the commanders on the spot have to deal with it as best they can. The kind of thing where unlooked for opportunities and events create wildly unexpected upsets, and in either direction.<br/>\n<blockquote>* Another view is the "wargames" as played by military commanders in training (possibly throughout history!).

Some of the debate among war gamers has to do with aspects of handling time/playability as well. Some of it has to do with "fun" and where people find it. Some of it has to do with "game"y rules producing wildly a-historic results ( a classic one being vastly higher casualty rates than real battles).\n<blockquote>However, my favourite take on D&amp;D is the variant where the player roles are asymmetrical: the referee (DM) is attempting to present a "Simulationist" view of the game world (although somewhat selectively: at least, where it is possible to do so without reducing the game into an un-fun proposition - most D&amp;D groups aren't interested in accurately simulating wounds and infection, for example, nor settings where there are no monsters nor treasure), by crafting logical sequences of cause and effect in order to create a sequence of gameplay. Meanwhile, the players are equally committed to the "reality" of the imagined fiction/setting, but doing their best to perform competitively <i>within its limitations</i>.</blockquote>\nSo much this.<br/><br/>This is very much in line with the thinking of the niche of war gamer hobbyists I'm talking about.<br/>\n<blockquote>It might be considered "good sportsmanship" at some tables, for example, to play within the limitations of your character's intelligence or knowledge (e.g. your character doesn't know that it is possible to create gunpowder, or the formula for doing so). In such a group, the limitation of avoiding out-of-character knowledge is accepted <i>precisely because</i> it makes it more challenging to play the game, and the players enjoy that particular challenge. (Much in the same way that I would accept the rule not to use my hands in a game of soccer, whether the other team can see it or not.)</blockquote>\nAgain, dead on.<br/><br/>There are a couple of other ways it might come out, especially in war games.<br/><br/>1) Team games where individual team members all have broadly the same goals, but then have sub-goals that makes co-operation tricky. Often the sub-goals are hidden from team mates, or are up to the players whether they reveal them or not.<br/><br/>Example: It's WW2 in Western Europe. The Allies are all in agreement that Nazi Germany must be defeated as effectively and rapidly as possible, minimizing Allied casualties whenever possible. One of the Allied players is DeGaulle, who has a sub-goal/personal goal of prioritizing the recapture of Paris. the other Allies have decided to bypass Paris and isolate it, and have built plans to do so. What does DeGaulle do here?<br/><br/>2) Vague and contradictory goals, often without an obvious "scoring" mechanism. Players will need to prioritize them using their own judgment. Post-game discussion and analysis, based on how players attempted to follow these goals and the results of those attempts define Win/Loss/Other.<br/><br/>Example: You need to bring the enemy to battle and defeat their local forces, but in such a way that you continue to have an effective fighting force to deal with other enemy formations that could be brought into the local theater later. How much are you willing to risk in open battle, and at what point, even if winning, do you withdraw to maintain your force-in-being for later operations?<br/><br/>3) The GM/Scenario designer may build in "bait" events or opportunities/traps unknown to the players at the beginning of play based on the above points, or even simply random, unlooked for occurrences that players may deal with as they choose.<br/><br/>Example: Your army is risking a desperate gamble to take the fighting into enemy territory for a change of pace. Your army is undersupplied, and entering unknown territory, but if the gamble succeeds, it can change the entire character of the war. You're the force's primary reconnaissance commander. Your forces have been scouting away from the main body, and have good intelligence that an enemy supply depot nearby has material your force desperately needs, and is largely unguarded. Certainly this material would vastly improve the fighting capacity of your force in the longer term, but capturing the depot will take time and move you away from the main body of your army. Do you go for it?<br/><br/>If this knd of challenge revs you up as a wargamer, you're basically the wargamer equivalent of a "narrativist"\n<blockquote>I'm not familiar with the debate, but my guess is that such a more nuanced view might obviate the debate entirely (although it may still come up on minor matters, such as whether the group finds Armor vs. Weapon modifiers interesting, or not).</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460772/#Comment_460772" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-28T03:09:53+00:00" title="February 28, 2017  3:09AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a lot to chew on, but I feel like even considering some of the good points being made here, D&amp;D's combination of "opponent" and "referee" causes some pretty severe damage to its value as a objective wargame.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460778/#Comment_460778" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-28T06:32:37+00:00" title="February 28, 2017  6:32AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2017 2:14PM by komradebob.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The GM isn't an opponent in D&amp;D, that's what's messing you up.

I played Swedish roleplaying games in the Basic Role Playing (BRP) tradition like Drakar och Demoner (fantasy game) and Mutant, later played Kult, and Vampire 2nd Edition before I found the Forge and all those games. To be honest, without having played it, I always looked down on D&amp;D (the game, not the players) because it seemed so shallow, focused only on combat and levels and HP. Even though I enjoyed combat in my games, I expected RPGs to cover more situations, and felt that D&amp;D was just a power fantasy where the solution to every problem was violence. (I was wrong.)<br/><br/>I've always been interested in minimalism, more recently in the ideas of "omit needless words" from Elements of Style, "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." (Antoine de Saint-Exup\xe9ry), and the decluttering movement of getting rid of things you own to create more space. When I read Moldvay's B/X D&amp;D after seeing it mentioned here and playing it a bit online, frankly mostly the Basic part, it felt like I found this chiseled stone that contained exactly what's needed to run the game. I don't have the time or patience anymore for 300 page rulebooks, especially games that don't give you any clear direction of what to do during a session. When I say B/X, I actually mean only B (Basic), but B/X is a nicer acronym so I'll keep it. I haven't looked as closely at X.<br/><br/>What I liked about many Forge games (say InSpectres, Dogs in The Vineyard, My Life with Master) when I found them was that they presented a clear situation and gave you a minimal set of rules for handling that situation. B/X is the same, in that the game says that the session starts as the group enters the dungeon and ends when they leave, and it gives you the tools you need to run a dungeon crawl: combat, task handling (save vs attribute), light, food, monsters, treasure, and so on. <br/><br/>One similarity between the Forge games I listed above and B/X is that they all give the GM the tools to generate a situation as part of prep. InSpectres has a table to create a mission seed, Dogs has the town creation guidelines, MLwM has the master creation rules. B/X has a set of tools to create a dungeon where you roll on random tables to place monsters and treasure. Then all four games tell the GM to present the immediate situation and back off, not steer the group in a particular direction to present a GM-prepared story. It's up to the players what they want to do. The GM gives information and applies pressure in all games, but there's no planned story with checkpoints that the group must follow in a certain order, something that was common in the other RPGs I played growing up. Instead of the Dogs town, you have the dungeon and its inhabitants, and they all either want to get rid of or ally themselves with the PCs. As others have said, this is even based on a random reaction roll, so even the GM doesn't know exactly what will happen in the dungeon.<br/><br/>You could add things to B/X if you wanted to make the rules more detailed. You could add hit locations or an exhaustion system, things I had in other games I played growing up, but going back to Saint-Exup\xe9ry I feel that would take you further away from perfection rather than towards it. Also part of my minimalistic interests is low level B/X play, where you have a very limited set of rule-based options (low chance to hit, low HP so you can't mess up and take many hits, one spell per day), which forces the player to go beyond the written rules and try to navigate the fiction in a way that gives them a chance to succeed. I love how you don't have to balance any encounters to fit the group of players and PCs. It's perfectly fine to put a dragon and a giant treasure in an adventure for level 1 PCs. If they are greedy enough to try to steal anything they might get toasted without standing a chance, but the situation is not designed so that they *have* to fight the dragon as the case might be in a traditional checkpoint-based adventure where the dragon is step 3 of 10 on the way to defeat the evil wizard in the final chapter of the story.<br/><br/>The retroclone I've played the most is Whitehack, which is similar in many ways that make it easy to run modules from other games, but has more free-form classes and magic, and other innovations. I've grafted in the magic system from Drakar och Demoner (the Swedish fantasy game I played in the 80s) because we use modules from that game, which works perfectly because the scaffolding in the base game is strong enough, or modular enough, that you can pull out one subsystem and replace it without affecting other parts. When I find a situation that Whitehack doesn't handle, I can search OSR blogs and forums for an answer, for example how to handle encumbrance for a horse, how do to best handle sneaking as a group, and so on. Because the clones are so similar, you can easily adopt rules from many different OSR communities, which gives you input from a range of people that may play clones that focus more on different things.<br/><br/>As I said, I'm inspired by Moldvay Basic and Whitehack. What I've read of Mentzer or BECMI, or AD&amp;D, doesn't feel as minimalistically nice. I guess that instead of searching OSR blogs for rules ideas I could browse those games first, but they fall into "300 pages, my eyes glaze over" so I haven't made an effort to get to know them closer. Since I'm mostly interested in low-level play, they include a lot of stuff that just isn't necessary when that's your focus. It doesn't mean they are bad games, and a lot of people find them more complete games because they handle more situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460782/#Comment_460782" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-28T15:32:16+00:00" title="February 28, 2017  3:32PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The GM isn't an opponent in D&amp;D, that's what's messing you up.

to the characters that they are controlling. Part of the job of the simulationist/environmental referee is to portray the opposition in a manner that preserves verisimilitude. So she plays the orcs not as generic units controlled by her, but as units governed by what orcs are or should be capable of (though whether or not the players should be similarly restricted in how their characters act has been a contentious issue in roleplaying for quite some time).<br/><br/>If I want to set out to examine an actual historical battle and how a change in one side's tactics could have affected the outcome, I'd need someone to play the other side in a relatively historically accurate fashion in order to test out my hypothesis. They may still be trying to win, but in order to get the most out of the scenario I'd need the opposition to follow a certain set of rules that restricts their behavior; it's not a game of Me vs. My Friend, it's Me vs. the Red Army (as portrayed by my friend who knows a lot about Red Army tactics and can faithfully recreate them). It shifts the the game from the realm of competition to inquisition, but I would say it's still firmly within the purview of wargaming (if anything, it's the kind of wargaming that I prefer, compared to cultures built around balanced pickup games).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460788/#Comment_460788" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-28T16:26:41+00:00" title="February 28, 2017  4:26PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You'd also like the stuff at that link, yukamichi.<br/><br/>It's very much in line with what you've posted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460789/#Comment_460789" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-28T16:48:18+00:00" title="February 28, 2017  4:48PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I already looked through it and I was overwhelmed with all the stuff that people have done that I'd never heard about or even thought about; I'm really glad you shared it!

It's not a simple task.<br/><br/>However, there are many tools, principles, and tricks which can be used to make this easier. <br/><br/>I should also mention that I've heard that, in some early D&amp;D circles, players did "control" the monsters in the dungeon.

Also, I specified miniatures war game, because board war games tend to be more likely to have those kinds of mechanics.<br/><br/>Also, just out of curiosity, has anyone played old forms of D&amp;D ( or similar OSR games) where they really went all out on the  "Build a Warband" approach? I mean that in comparison to "Build a PC Party".<br/><br/>I've noticed that the "war band" approach has gotten more discussion since people began re-examining the possibility as old school began to be talked about more, but I still don't recall a whole lot of people talking about using it to any great degree.<br/><br/>Warband approach: Building a small army by use of the henchmen/hireling/mercenary rules when going adventuring, from step one. From my estimates of the way the random 3d6X 10 starting gold pieces works, most beginning parties should be able to kit out a fairly sizable expedition, even right at chargen, provided it isn't going to be in the field that long.<br/><br/>We've never tended to use them much, even in the present day because:<br/><br/>1) It doesn't seem terribly heroic ( this was true even as kids)<br/>2) I've never been all that sure how the rules governing all of it were actually supposed to work<br/>( some of them seem quite contradictory, especially regarding pay and XPs for hirelings/henchmen/mercs)<br/>3) I honestly doubt many people really want to control multiple characters, even a half -dozen or so, not even when they're very simple characters<br/>4) I'm not entirely sure that old low level adventure modules are truly set up to handle four PCs and a total of thirty or so various types of hirelings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460802/#Comment_460802" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-01T15:19:09+00:00" title="March  1, 2017  3:19PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I haven't had a chance to play it, I've been really intrigued by the Iron Kingdoms RPG and the extent to which it interfaces with standard Warmachine/Hordes play. I feel like there's a ton of potential in it for hybrid RPG/wargame campaign play. I had a group that used to do this with Battletech-family games back in the day (and am playing a popular solo/AI-opposition campaign variant right now, even), though that's a board wargame and like you said it's much more common in that arena (over its life Battletech has printed a number of supplements specifically to support this "manage your own command" style of play, and arguably even the roleplaying rules are used more often just to create characters for purely wargame campaigns).<br/><br/>I feel like if one were to attempt such a thing in D&amp;D, it might beg a shift away from dungeon-environment and local-problem-solving frameworks that a lot of adventures are based in, if only because (like you insinuated) it seems like having that many characters involved kills some of the magic of the "small band of plucky adventurers getting by on luck and wits," though obviously it also opens up lots of new play space too (imagine marching an army into the Village of Hommlet, or the Demonweb Pits!). I've been playing an old fantasy war game for the Super Nintendo called Ogre Battle recently and there are so many parallels that can be drawn between the way the game presents its story and sandboxy, environment-based D&amp;D play; it's actually been giving me a hankering for a more overtly war-focused D&amp;D game.<br/><br/>That being said, I can think of a couple games that have tried to balance "PC heroism" with commanding large groups of people, but they do it by essentially minimizing your hirelings significance as individuals: in one game your henchmen are just a currency that you can spend to power special abilities or boost attacks (with plenty of rules for manipulating that currency, like enemies that deal damage directly to your total number of henchmen), and another uses different military units as a kind of template of boosted abilities applied to your PC with an additional "morale" mechanic, but otherwise maintains the exact same rules as normal man-level combat (which is almost ingenious in a way).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460804/#Comment_460804" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-01T16:17:26+00:00" title="March  1, 2017  4:17PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>(Hey, some people really enjoy the Killer GM approach as well! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )</blockquote>\nThis kind fun begun there for some reason.

Sometimes the adventurers go out alone as an elite commando team (PCs are "elite" because they have certain mechanical advantages and because they have players running them, which makes them smarter - less morale checking and such), sometimes they have a bunch of henchmen to get the party size up to the 10-20 heads range (optimal for dungeoneering, I think), and sometimes they run a company with anything up to 200 people in it.<br/><br/>In the current campaign/arc the players thrashed the very first dungeon by maneuvering the local village to muster a fyrd and do some troll-slaying communally, instead of going and trying to do it themselves like they're "supposed" to. I think every PC got something like ~5 XP worth of treasure out of it at the end, after the fyrd got their share. Not much risk, but didn't particularly advance the quest for the fabled 2nd level, either <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Right at this writing the party has attached itself to the Keep on the Borderlands as sort of military specialists, with various individual relations to the military organization running the keep. The party leader holds a sergeant rank in the keep and was until last week's session quite respected for his field leadership and success in scouting operations (read: dungeon crawls) against the troll menace; he usually didn't have any difficulty filling the ranks, whether he wanted three elite henchmen or ten motivated average ones. After a bad defeat he lost his golden boy aura, though, so now he's under pressure to produce results again if he wants to keep his position of responsibility and acclaim in the insular military society of the keep.<br/><br/>The keep has a total of ~100 soldiers involved in its winter maintenance, and they're all "in play" in terms of the strategic situation. If the trolls attack there this winter (the Caverns of Chaos are quite close, as you might know), it is entirely conceivable that we'll end up playing something that couldn't be distinguished from an ordinary medieval fantasy wargame scenario. It's not a big war, but then that's not what a "wargame" necessarily requires. Besides, it's totally up to the players to involve themselves in a bigger war if they wish to: there're Danes down south ravaging the Swedish countryside right now if they want to take the campaign to an even more wargame-ish direction.<br/><br/>When I last ran a game in Upper Savo some years past (I've written a bit about the adventures then here at SG), the entire campaign ultimately started revolving around one PCs dream to become a mercenary captain in the Italian wars. Ultimately that became true, at the end he was running a small-ish company full of heart in a campaign that sort of resembled Black Company novels more than every day D&amp;D. As in, one of the more memorable adventures involved an entire town being besieged by several thousand zombies, with the PCs smuggling the town treasury out of there while leading the defenses, all with basically wargaming methodology to it.<br/><br/>In general I have to say that there is no difference between wargaming and D&amp;D to me: the only thing particularly special in D&amp;D is that it propositions that scenarios should develop organically out of campaigning, with a true vertical connection between strategic and tactical concerns; in D&amp;D you don't just set up whatever scenario nilly-willy, you play yourself there. So if you want to be a general of an army, you go and seize that position as part of play, and once we're there we presumably have lots of idea about what you might wish to do with that army, too. There's never a barren point-buy phase where you make sure one side has as many forces as the other side or anything like that, it's all just simulation, simulation, simulation with just a dash of constructive assumption-making to abstract out of certain un-entertaining minor details that might get in the way of campaigning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460811/#Comment_460811" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-02T02:05:35+00:00" title="March  2, 2017  2:05AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2017 2:07AM by adamwb.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My group pretty regularly has more than 20 characters in the party. We've instituted a system so a player can act as caller for a party of up to their charisma score, and each such party rolls for encounters separately in the dungeon, so typically for dungeon adventures they squeeze down to 16 or so, unless they have a particularly large battle they want to do. But when they are out in the wilderness they sometimes are recruiting in every town the pass through.<br/><br/>In this game hirelings are absolutely a currency and a measure of the night's pacing. At low levels, having hirelings around means that you can roll one of them up as a PC if you die, so as long as there are a few of them still around it means go deeper. At higher levels, we've got an expensive but very liberal system for recruiting henchfolk, so increasingly they replace the more plentiful men-at-arms and torchbearers as the currency that matters, and getting them up to level two or three before they get killed is one of the medium-term challenges for those players, since their own levels come so slowly.<br/><br/>One player is right now exploiting henches to have a whole troupe under their own command, my ruling was that your charisma max followers number determines the number who can answer to you directly, but henches can have their own, so this player regularly has a three-line squad of 10 or more on wilderness nights.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460812/#Comment_460812" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-02T03:08:49+00:00" title="March  2, 2017  3:08AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>(Hey, some people really enjoy the Killer GM approach as well! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )</blockquote>\nThis kind fun begun there for some reason.

In practice, it's a really difficult *module* or "dungeon" or "adventure" which takes the role of the "Killer", and the GM simply takes a really hard line at interpreting their authority as GM - no excuses, no takebacks.<br/><br/>The tradition exists mainly in the "modules" which have incredible levels of challenge and tricky or totally implausible traps and encounters (which are clearly set up to fool players, not to be even remotely believable). An example is any module which has passages which "appear straight" but actually curve very, very lightly or slope up or down imperceptibly. The players are unlikely to ever notice this little detail, but it makes mapping the dungeon very, very difficult, and will likely fool the players into thinking they're making errors.<br/><br/>Another famous example is "Tomb of Horrors". This kind of "dungeon" has arbitrary deathtraps around every corner. Part of the fun is seeing your characters get mutilated and then trying to bypass or figure out how to get through with the next character. A very high level of "PC lethality" has to be combined with repeated visits to the same location, scores of henchmen, or stables of PCs.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460813/#Comment_460813" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-02T04:18:06+00:00" title="March  2, 2017  4:18AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I finally came to terms with that type of gameplay, it's just that I had a terrible first experience with it.

A straight 1st level party without a budget is in for some pretty challenging times indeed. However, if you add some smaller starter dungeons and such alternatives to even out the start, it's not that bad. This, of course, goes for all sorts of things: the difficult level of individual locations doesn't matter much if the players get a hand on choosing where to go.<br/><br/>Amusingly enough, in our campaign the Caves of Chaos have been built up as so scary that the party, despite having a single 3rd level character at this point to support the 1st-levelers, is still shying away from the place. I guess I'll have to blame the "color" element in part: I renamed the place setting-appropriately and attached various legends about the "Troll King" (as in, the Hobgolin leader) running the place as his personal court, and suddenly it's starting to sound like a pocket-size Mordor. It' still possible that the party could end up spending the entire winter at the Keep, running minor sideshow adventures, without ever daring to set foot in the Caves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460828/#Comment_460828" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-02T15:43:01+00:00" title="March  2, 2017  3:43PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>B2 Keep on the Borderlands is <i>deadly</i> if you play it straight.

There is a difference between essentially following an algorithm - which is what a computer game does, no matter how complex - and actually making decisions (which are expected to be impartial.)   What you are describing is more like the various co-op boardgames where the objective is to beat the mechanics of the game (Pandemic or something.) than it is like an RPG.<br/><br/>Either a player is doing their best to win, or they can be allowed to be a referee and administrate/set up challenges.  I don't think the alternative is legitimate, especially given the absolute freedom to array challenges as they see fit that the GM is given.<br/><br/>If you sat down to play chess with someone, and you had the standard set of chess pieces, and they got to pick whatever they wanted, maybe you could trust them to try to pick a game that you still have a chance to win.   But if they can also change the rules when they feel like it? Or otherwise "administer" the game?<br/><br/>I think all the discussion of both "killer GMs" and "fudging" (essentially a GM realizing that playing their side "fairly" isn't going to be fun for anyone) point to how inherently problematic this combination of  roles is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460835/#Comment_460835" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-02T19:05:46+00:00" title="March  2, 2017  7:05PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe in the referee-GM; if it's just an illusion, and we're fooling ourselves, then it is one that has successfully mislead many clever people I know, myself included, for hundreds and thousands of hours of play. Before, during and after play the illusion has succeeded so well that I have been thoroughly convinced of the following:<br/><b>*</b> The GM is playing the rules and procedures as agreed upon.<br/><b>*</b> The GM has made judgement calls on various situations to the best of their knowledge, taking input and arguments from other players as relevant.<br/><b>*</b> This process has actually allowed us to achieve certain truths and insights about the tactical and strategic case studies we've engaged in during the course of play.<br/><b>*</b> The above points have held true both when I've been GMing and when I've been a player in games that have attempted this.<br/><br/>(Note the penultimate point, that's the crux issue and ultimate goal of this kind of wargaming: if whatever the players are doing at the table, whether you call it "refereeing" or "square dancing", is providing them with true insight, then evidently it's a functional practice that furthers the goals of the game.)<br/><br/>I have, of course, also been a player in games where the referee-GM has not been attempted, and in games where it has been falsely posited (while the GM is really not doing it), as well as games where it has been tried and failed (due to lack of skill and understanding with the proper procedures of play). This makes me believe that I'm observing a real phenomenon that occasionally succeeds when performed correctly, because otherwise I have no explanation why some of my experiences with this sort of thing have seemed like successes while others have seemed like failures. Evidently I'm observing <i>something</i> that makes these experiences different, at least, even if it's not objective refereeing but rather some other variable.<br/><br/>I think that it's reasonable to argue about whether the referee model is a fun or useful way to play roleplaying games or wargames or whatever D&amp;D is, but arguing that it <i>does not exist</i> is basically an argument for my experiences being illusionary. You people don't know me, so maybe it's credible for you that I've just been confused and convinced by propaganda to see something that's not there, but that doesn't seem at all credible to me; I'd need some actual proof to counter-balance numerous experiences to the contrary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460839/#Comment_460839" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-02T20:19:23+00:00" title="March  2, 2017  8:19PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed; I'm with Eero on this one. I think it *is* a challenge, but it creates a really interesting mode of play when a group is capable of it. (And don't forget that the players must, to some extent, participate in this, not only in their interactions with the GM, but also in the way they decide on actions for their characters. There is mental discipline involved for all participants, and it requires everyone to <b>trust</b> that the others are doing so, as well.)<br/><br/>Deliverator,<br/><br/>I like the idea of bringing in other players to play the opposition, and I've been the "invitee" a handful of times. However, I've also seen it go wrong.<br/><br/>* In a dramatic game, it may difficult to balance a newly-introduced character with existing roles. For example, I was once a "guest" in an ongoing campaign, and my character ended up being sidelined entirely, leaving me to observe most of the game, unable to play. (The PCs took a long time to "meet" my character, and then decide to knock her unconscious and stuff her into the trunk of a car...)<br/><br/>* In a competitive or challenge-based game, it can be difficult to manage spotlight as well as to maintain "fog of war".<br/><br/>When you have someone come in to play the "opposition", how do you approach these challenges? For instance, if the PCs are moving into a dungeon, and the "guest" is set to play the dragon in the dungeon, what happens if:<br/><br/>* The PCs decide not to go to the part of the dungeon where the dragon is (or fail to find the dungeon, or get killed before they meet the dragon, etc, etc)?<br/><br/>* The PCs spend a very long time doing other things first, or decide to run away from the dragon, and are successful in doing so?<br/><br/>* The dragon player wants to do a number of things "off-screen", particularly things they might want to keep secret from the PCs (e.g. preparing defenses or sneaking around)?<br/><br/>Do you have techniques and approaches you use to avoid such awkward situations, or any other tips and tricks? How does it normally go in your games?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460850/#Comment_460850" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-03T06:07:15+00:00" title="March  3, 2017  6:07AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess just making sure the NPC is introduced right at the start of session, in one way or another, and that the PCs will either be sufficiently motivated to interact with them or the NPC is sufficiently inescapable that it won't be an issue.

Also, like a lot of kids in the early 80s, we did assume it was supposed to work a bit like a boardgame or video game. Of course you were supposed to simply plow through, room by room, annihilating whatever critters you found there!<br/><br/>( also, notably, the module that sets up the whole Goblin Kids dilemma. Good thing there are no paladins in Basic D&amp;D!)<br/><br/>Looking back at B2, I'm not even entirely sure what you're really supposed to do with it exactly, although we played the heck out of it ( and probably also picked up some very bad habits that haunted us later because of it).<br/><br/>I will also say that, per Airk's concerns, this is rather a hard module to run as a neutral Referee, without absolutely slaughtering the PCs, even if you're throwing in some randomness to account for the Chaotic nature of the Caves' inhabitants to gauge their response to PC incursions.<br/><br/>In retrospect, I almost feel that putting B1 (In Search of the Unknown) or ( had it existed) B5 ( Horror on the Hill) would have been better choices for an intro module.<br/><br/>B1 is truly a trainer, and is a bit weird and disconnected, but that might have been good in it's own way. B5 was almost an improved B2 in some ways, and actually involved SPOILERS!... a dragon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460875/#Comment_460875" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-03T20:32:24+00:00" title="March  3, 2017  8:32PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're quite right, I think:<br/><br/>This community, taken collectively, is pretty good at discussing D&amp;D in relation to other RPGs, but seems (relatively speaking) pretty unfamiliar with its relationships to other types of wargaming.
