We're glad to announce that <a href="http://editorialrunica.blogspot.com.ar/2014/08/bienvenidos-welcome.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Runica publishing</b></a> has come to life today. <br/><br/>We posted here some weeks ago, asking for naming advice for a publisher. We took your advice into consideration, and finally "Runica" was chosen, as many of you suggested.<br/><br/>About us: we're the same guys who run the blog <a href="http://runasexplosivas.blogspot.com.ar/" rel="nofollow">Runas Explosivas</a>. We've been active in Spanish forums for several years, taking our first steps in design in contests like Rolero de Hierro. We've also been reading (and playing) as many games and as much theory as we could, and we wanted to start sharing with the world our enthusiasm with the hobby. First it was the blog (3 months old now), and now the publisher.<br/><br/>We intend to publish stuff both in Spanish and English: original games, translations, and modules or adventures for existing games. As our welcome post states, during this first phase we need a lot of feedback, and that's why most of our releases will be for free. Our first 2 products are a Spanish <a href="http://editorialrunica.blogspot.com.ar/p/translations.html" rel="nofollow">translation </a>of <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3269630/dwdotcom/world_of_dungeons_1979_bw.pdf" rel="nofollow">World of Dungeons</a>, and <a href="http://editorialrunica.blogspot.com.ar/p/nanogames.html" rel="nofollow">Nanodungeon</a>, an original game by Juan Manuel \xc1vila. I hope you like it! You will find, soon, announcements about our future releases on the page.<br/><br/>See you!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
