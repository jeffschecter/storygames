I would call it a qualified success. The things that seemed to work:<br/><br/>(1) Letting each player in turn choose the category of encounter to come: combat, skill challenge, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9591&amp;page=1#Item_19" rel="nofollow">Waltonesque combat grind</a> based on that player's sense of "what would come next" in the story.<br/><br/>(2) Mainly free-forming skill challenges so as to provide context for other sorts of encounters.<br/><br/>(3) Using a deck of 10 "encounter cards" to determine the level of the upcoming encounter (starting mix 4 @ lv 1, 3 @ lv 2, 2 @ lv 3, 1 @ lv 4) and incrementing the encounter level on the card by 1 before putting it in the discard pile.<br/><br/>(4) Using the deck of many things as an oracle to decide what the consequences were of completing a quest.<br/><br/>I think one thing I learned that I didn't anticipate is that the minis should always be on a map; this really helps to contextualize play. <br/><br/>The Waltonesque combat-grind did the most I think to speed up the action, but the reason that it worked is that players were in on the meta-gaming that resulted in the decision to treat a fight either as important enough to warrant an all-out combat scene or tangential enough to be mainly about the using up of resources.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230059/#Comment_230059" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T09:52:30+00:00" title="September  4, 2009  9:52AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            - Creating objectives that required movement, skill use, eliminating or protecting specific targets. <br/><br/>- The encounter is over when the objectives have been completed not when you reduce your opposition's HP to 0.<br/><br/>- Setting time limits (at the end of the allotted time the game ends, or you lose healing surges every round till you complete the objective, or more monsters start flooding the encounter.<br/><br/>- Eliminating the idea of encounters being a single combat.<br/><br/>- Eliminating milestones.<br/><br/>- Merging separate combat encounters into 1 mega encounter. Say you normally play 3 separate combats in separate locations. Instead we lay out the entire dungeon or area and allow the players to move anywhere at the risk of triggering additional combats. This way they can sneak around and decide what order to fight each combat or complete each objective at the risk of triggering multiple combats. But since you don\u2019t have to fight to the death, you can always maneuver away from combats towards your objectives.<br/><br/>- Since there are no longer separate combats, you gain action points, refresh encounter powers, and may use healing surges freely when you complete objectives.<br/><br/>- Non elite or solo monsters flee when bloodied or you get to make repeated intimidate checks as a minor action till they flee.<br/><br/>- Removing combo effects that slow down the game like weakened plus insubstantial.<br/><br/>- Limiting the use of effects that rob or cancel player\u2019s actions.<br/><br/>- Potential uses of stunts from the DMG are called out on the map.

Instead of choosing to use a stunt or attack, you can use a stunt to improve your attacks.

Damage done by a Controller or a Daily Power might also take them out (they must Save).<br/><br/>Maybe seem a bit off topic but not entirely since using minions can speed play; they go down quick and are easy bookkeeping.  So I use them a lot.  Typical fight for a heroic feel is a lead baddie, a couple lieutenants, and a bunch of minions.  The thing is the 4E designers have indicated in interviews that the RAW minions aren't worth 1/4 the XP of a standard monster when you're constructing your encounters per the DMG, more like 1/8th or even 1/10 I believe one of them said.  So, two hit minions to get the math right.

We play military campaign and these situations come up fairly often.  Because it's an issue of an alarm sounding, the one die roll to hit carries tension.  Came up last night were 4 minion jail guards (dispersed such that only 2 in burstable closeness) needed to be taken out quickly before they could raise alarm for example.  I handle the "xp value" issue by unilaterally reducing the XP for large #'s of minions that are bunched up or have to cover lots of ground to reach PC's.  Here too, the one hit works well for the campaign. there's a whole mob of goblins coming at you in true Lord of Rings style, you have a couple of rounds to thin them out before they're upon you...  It gives the PC's the cinematic feel and we then really focus on the fight with the real threats, and a handful of minions there to flank and otherwise help their bosses.<br/><br/>I also use the "what was the roll? oh don't both adding up all the math, that hit" (though Players like knowing they hit AC 26 even if they only needed AC 19).<br/><br/>Don't have much else to offer, as posted in another thread, table doesn't find it slow.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230177/#Comment_230177" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-05T07:35:03+00:00" title="September  5, 2009  7:35AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Write the name of each monster and their four defenses on a note card and put it on the table.

On my end of the table are simple 3x5 cards folded over into little tents.  On one side in large print is the character's name.  This side faces the players.  On the other side in smaller print and facing me is the character's name, their defenses (AC,FORT,REF &amp; WILL), and their passive Perception and Insight. The cards are arranged from my right to left once initiative is established.  I don't roll monster initiatives; they "Take 10" and the PC order falls around the monster 3x5 cards according to their rolls.  When someone is taking their turn, I move the card an inch or two in front of the others so players can easily see who's turn it is and who's up next.  If someone delays their action, I can easily move their card to reflect the change.<br/><br/>        Those dry erase boards or magnetic boards that people spend money on, ostensibly to speed up combat, can actually slow it in practice; they're typically lying flat so people can't see them well, or they're propped up but then fall periodically.  And when player order shifts it's a pain to either re-write or move the magnetic elements.<br/><br/>    * After the first round or two, have the monster groups with high initiatives delay their actions to be equal to the slowest monsters so you effectively have one monster turn and one player turn.  That way the player can effectively go in whatever turn order they want among each other and they don't have to worry about the tactical situation having changed much.  When it gets to their individual action they should usually already know exactly what they're going to do and be immediately rolling their dice.  <i>This "one-big-monster-Go-one-big-player-Go" is critical and is what gets you those 10 to 30 second turns.</i><br/><br/>        Having the PC defenses at hand, I never have to ask whether an attack hit and can actually start rolling some of the attacks during the last player's turn so that I can concentrate on describing the action when it's my turn proper.  If a PC has an immediate reaction we can back things up a bit.  The players also know to remind me if they've got an elevated defense for some reason.<br/><br/>    * I have a counter tray of conditions that we put next to miniatures to give us a visual reminder of any status conditions; dazed, ongoing necrotic damage, etc.  One of the players is responsible to administer these counters, not me as DM.  We also have these 4x6 status tents we put in front of players as a reminder of any ongoing conditions.  When we were first learning 4E they served to show us exactly what things like "dazed" meant in game terms.  Now that we have all of that down they're just to remind us we have the effects and to take damage at the beginning of our turns and roll for saves at the end of our turns where applicable.<br/><br/>*pic here later*<br/><br/>    * In the group that doesn't roleplay much, we give to +2 damage for any player who's turn takes ten or fewer seconds.  We actually have quite a few of these turns as it's pretty effective to simply do a quick at-will this way than to figure out some big multi-player strategy involving turn order and some daily or encounter power.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230229/#Comment_230229" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-05T16:54:38+00:00" title="September  5, 2009  4:54PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Write the name of each monster and their four defenses on a note card and put it on the table.

It had the dual benefit of effectively reducing monster durability (akin to lower hit points) as well as reducing the number of dice rolled at the table. For crits, all attacks were considered "Brutal" with actual Brutal weapons doubly so. <i>Result:</i> This was met with mixed reaction from the group. Most felt "meh" about it and we quickly went back to rolling damage for everyone. So they didn't like it. But we were coasting through 5 or more encounters a night with time left over for roleplay and skill challenges...</li>\n<li><b>Action Point Craziness:</b> In several sessions, I allowed for lots of AP whackiness. For instance, I ditched milestones and started handing out APs for good roleplaying, doing something really cool, rolling really poorly, etc. The end result was that players had bank action points. Like 3-5 on average. And they were allowed to use as many as they wanted in any encounter. But just not more than one per round. <i>Result:</i> This did seem like a success. It sped up combat because players were able to do more per encounter. And we also had a fun negotiation about what would cost an Action Point versus what wouldn't. So if someone missed a daily, they could spend an Action Point to reroll. Or if they didn't want to fail a save. They could spend an AP to automatically succeed. This helped some players with those Death Saves. This was the better received of the two experiments.</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234241/#Comment_234241" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-25T10:10:46+00:00" title="September 25, 2009 10:10AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've cut monster health and boosted action points before.

For example, recently running sneaking into a tower via the conduit of magical vitae flowing from it that has caused passage to "come alive".  This was reskinned from a scales of war adventure that had a trap/hazard here, but it was essentially a "random monster" feel.  So it was just, "passage comes alive everyone make choice of Acrobatics or Athletics check and describe how you avoid its attacks, failure means you take one attack at +xx, for xx damage".<br/><br/>Similarly, random animals/monsters etc. in woods boring.  You want to sneak to the evil faery lair deep in the woods.  Make a single nature check to see if while doing so you manage forest hazards and difficulties, before you check your Stealth for the sneaking.  Failure means you run into problems making you more obvious to watchers and patrols, success means you avoid such, really good success means you turn them to your advantage and have an easier time.  The forest itself and its denizens is not the point, only how dealing with it changes circumstances of dealing with the real foe of interest.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/twilight" title="twilight"><img alt="twilight" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/twilight">twilight</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234981/#Comment_234981" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-01T06:17:12+00:00" title="October  1, 2009  6:17AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2009 6:17AM by twilight.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Posted By: Kropotkin</b><br/>\nHow about this:<br/>\n<br/>\nNot interested in playing out a full encounter?

I only have experience with one combat that functioned in this manner: Attacks vs. AC, skills vs. passive resistance unless they were leaders/elites. I think it allows for more cinematic/story-driven D&amp;D.; After so many successes, the leader's resolve cracks and it may flee. Players can make Athletic checks to pursue, ranged attacks vs. AC, Bluff checks to trick them or Nature/Dungeoneering to track or corral them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also removed the battlemat since the tactical movement by some players bordered on two minutes or longer. So I've borrowed from 3:16 and use: Flanked, Close, Short and Long. A move action allows you to change between Flanked, Close and Short; moving 10 squares allow you to change between Short and Long. Move 10 squares at Long range to flee from combat. Pulls, pushes, shifts and the like function the same way; really slow creatures can move maximum movement over two turns (Ochre Jellys, for example) to change ranges. Ranged attacks are a little ambiguous.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recognize this makes it D&amp;D; FauxE, but it works and the players seem happy. Maybe after this campaign they'll finally let me try Mouse Guard or Primetime Adventures. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235024/#Comment_235024" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-01T10:50:46+00:00" title="October  1, 2009 10:50AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In our last Regularly Scheduled 4e, we decided to tech up on the whole playing faster thing. <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://adrianrp.wikispot.org/D%26D_Fast-play_Dungeon_Delves" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the DM's writeup.

Seems to work find in practice.<br/>2) Initiative: GM rolls initiative for the chief monster, any player that beat his roll for initiative can act in round 1, otherwise they can't. Turn order is all players act (in whatever order they like) then all monsters. This allows the players to act when they're ready, rather than having to wait for each other.<br/>3) Auto-hit: We ditched this because some of the players liked rolling to hit, however it worked well mechanically (and lets players be a little more tactical).<br/>It needs a few further tweeks, like 1 AP per encounter, you can spend an AP for a critical hit (if you crit on a 18 or 19 you have a chance to recover it), reliable dailies can be used 2/day and I think there was a couple more I can't remember at the moment.<br/><br/>I like revealing the monsters defences, I may have to start doing that. Since my players are at paragon level it's not even much of an immersion breaker... by that level I'd imagine you know how to size an enemy up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235222/#Comment_235222" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T10:25:36+00:00" title="October  2, 2009 10:25AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm thinking really seriously about a timer, and rewarding with extra XP using a percentage based on how much faster we go than the timer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235223/#Comment_235223" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T10:26:26+00:00" title="October  2, 2009 10:26AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a game on Tuesday.

They had to use all of these.  I also gave them a free natural 20 and a free 1 (unless they rolled these, then they got one or two additional rolls). Combat went super fast. The other rule was that they HAD to use all the rolls before they started rolling again.<br/><br/>The free 1 was a bad idea, if I do this again I'll just give the free 20, probably just flatly (so if you rolled one, bully for you!).  The low rolls were kind of meh.  But at least players knew when it was time for an at-will, they definitely felt that it was better to roll poorly than know you have a bad roll coming, overall.  I did the same thing for myself, except that I could not pick and choose. I had to go straight down the list as I rolled it.<br/><br/>However, I'll probably be trying this out again. Instead of our normal hour+ we did the combat in 30 minutes (granted, it was all minions, but it was also 24 minions and no controller!)<br/><br/>Instead of a timer, I've found that having the players pick a action goal for the round helps.  Last session we were running late. We had 10 minutes left and were in the middle of the round. We knew we couldn't finish the combat, but we could at least finish the round. So it was decided, they would alpha strike the controller/leader monster.  And alpha strike they did. They all rolled their attackes in regular initiative order, rolled damage, did everything the same, except that it only took 5 minutes instead of like 15.  I'm not sure how to translate this into regular play (we play again this weekend, so I get to find out if we learned something from that, and maybe that's all we need).  I'm thinking a reminder at the top of the round to prepare your actions will be enough.  We take far too long in combat, and very little of it has to do with the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236018/#Comment_236018" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-06T19:35:36+00:00" title="October  6, 2009  7:35PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2009 7:36PM by Steve_Hickey.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alvin, that pre-rolling sounds amazing.
