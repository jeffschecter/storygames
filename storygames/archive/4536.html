Which wasn't the best place for it, as there's nothing system-specific about it. This seemed a much better place.<br/><br/>I feel that good RPGs are about interesting choices, and part of the role of a system is to clarify and codify those choices. If there are no choices to be made, why play out the scene at all? Feel free to disagree if you think I'm barking up the wrong tree there. In something like D&amp;D, the choices presented in combat are mainly tactical. You have these enemies, these resources. Combine in a way that works well.<br/><br/>In a horror game, that seems less appropriate. A certain amount of "you douse the zombie in petrol, I get the torch from the wall" teamwork may be a good fit for a Dusk to Dawn kinda vibe. But too much is definitely not very horror.<br/><br/>So what other choices are there? I've thought of a few, but I'd like to hear more.<br/><br/>"Are you going home in a body-bag or a straitjacket?" is perhaps the bleakest. Not that interesting though.<br/>"What are you willing to  sacrifice to triumph?" has the problem that in much horror the stakes are so high that "Everything!" is the likely response. Some form of this might work in some styles, though.<br/>I remember TonyLB once described a cyberpunk(?) game on the Forge where the combat system was such that players had to choose between gathering information and taking action. That seems like it might be relevant, though I can't quite sum it up in a way that clicks for me.<br/>"Are you going to fight on, or run?" is often seen. But on what basis are players supposed to decide?<br/>"How do I survive this situation?" would work in games where getting into combat at all is basically a sign that things have gone badly wrong for the characters. <br/><br/>I suppose that leads to the counter question of what the role of combat is in a horror game in the first place. The answer to that probably would cast a lot of light on what the choices should be about. If you'd rather address that question, be my guest.<br/><br/>Any thoughts, suggestions? Am I just over-thinking this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102633/#Comment_102633" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T05:57:22+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  5:57AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2007 5:57AM by Graham.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, what a great subject.

It's either to show the players that their characters are facing insurmountable odds and thereby to evoke a feeling of helplessness and physical danger (usually initiated by me, the GM), and to fight with the horrors to hold them back for one day longer (which usually is initiated/orchestrated by the players and they hope it will be on their own terms).

I didn't understand all of it (probably still don't) but it sure sparked all kinds of ideas. My first design project was a horror game. <br/><br/>The basics were that at first, combat conflicts were impossible (or near-impossible) to win against the "main threat". Only fleeing/postponing was a possibility. How did you become better at facing the big bad in the finale? Simply by going through shit. Sure, you can get help along the way. Find a secret grimoire, new scientific data, a weapon, allies, but that's not going to be enough for the genre. <br/><br/>Basically, you "level up" in horror not through succeeding at fleeing and fighting. You level up through witnessing the failures of your comrades and/or being degraded by feeling through mud, having your beliefs severely shaken and losing things you care about. Only then are you ready to become what is refered to in the horror genre as "The Last Girl". The last girl is metaphorical. Doesn't need to be a girl and doesn't even need to be a single individual (although in my homebrew, it was mechanically likely to come down to a single person). <br/><br/>The side-effect of the mechanic was that characters were actually looking forward to get involved as they knew the only way to conclude the scenario was to experience shit, to explore issues and environment. <br/><br/>My two horrific cents, hope that helps <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102843/#Comment_102843" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T19:34:43+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  7:34PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way it works in Geiger Counter, which I stole from Vincent's Afraid, is that character accumulate problems through repeated encounters with the opposing force ("The Monster").  You broke your ankle.  You're freaking out.  You're hypnotized by dark forces.  Monsters don't always kill you right away.  Often times, they mark you for death and then cull the weak ones from the herd.  So beating the Monster means 1) you don't die now, 2) you don't accumulate another problem, and, once you get to Endgame, 3) you might even weaken the Monster a bit.

So "Does the monster kill you, or do you kill it?" is not usually a choice the player gets to make (in isolation), nor would they often choose "the monster kills me" unless there were some deeper choice that overrode that. <br/><br/>So in that sense, I guess I'm asking for reasons (other than simple suspense) not to resolve the entire scene on one die roll.

The monster is always there, coming after you, lurking in the shadows, getting close and closer all the time. Even when you think you have destroyed it, it always comes back. <br/><br/>It <i>matters</i> exactly how you survive, you need to play out how skin of the teeth that is, and it should be different every time. If you just resolve every encounter with the monster (or monsters) with a single roll then you don't get to concentrate on the terrifying detail of how close you come to failing all the time, and be totally sure (as players as well as characters) that this could have been it.

In a suspense horror you get worked up over time by lurking shadows, impending doom, and so on, on a rising tide of tension, and then it explodes in an action scene. The suspense gets you tense and on the edge of your seat, but its the action scene that has you actually shrieking when it happens. You need the detail of the combat / action to let off some of that accumulated tension, and then to set you up for the next round of gathering tension.<br/><br/>I have in mind something like one of the combat scenes in Alien, where Ripley is scrambling away from the Alien, stopping, shooting her flamethrower, dodging the claws and the acid, rolling through doors .... its an involved and detailed thing, and its as vital a part of the horror as the gathering tension was. The point of course is not to defeat the threat at that point (the final scene in alien where the alien is destroyed is combat lite), but to dodge death and injury at close range.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102989/#Comment_102989" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T09:08:28+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  9:08AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right.

The group's progress toward killing the monster (eventually, at which point the remaining characters survive); and<br/>2. The individual character's chance to survive this scene, right here, right now.<br/><br/>So when you look out for your own survival, you might doom members of the group in the long run. I'd make the menu of choices in a way that you can screw over others for your own survival, and that those who help the group most are also most likely to get snatched up right then.<br/><br/>It should work if you have enough players, but might not be suitable for a small group, unless each player has several characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102997/#Comment_102997" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T11:39:33+00:00" title="October 14, 2007 11:39AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Christian, that's interesting.

I think leaving it to one roll would also lead to a simpler narration, without all the twists and turns. You might say "<i>I scream as the monster comes for me, loosing off a few shots, and the turn and run down the passages towards the doctor's office</i>" but you would be a lot less likely to say "<i>I scream and loose three shots! The first two miss, one shattering a window, while the third smacks home ... but doesn't stop it! Its tongue shoots out, wrapping round my ankle and pulling me down heavily, knocking the wind from me. I scrabble on the floor, but I can't get a grip on the lino, but before it pulls me too close I shoot it in the tongue! It lets me go and I scramble too my feet and run to the end of the corridor. It still comes after me but I dodge left, and then right, and then throw myself through the shattered window of the nurses' station. When it rushes past I crawl the other way and then make a break for the doctor's office!</i>"<br/><br/>I think the purpose of the system here is to provide tension and uncertainty in fine detail. Yes, inspiring more elements of the narration, but also making the whole thing more complex and more fine grained than a single roll resolution. It would force you to do things not knowing if you were going to succeed, and living more in the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103132/#Comment_103132" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-15T16:43:45+00:00" title="October 15, 2007  4:43PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, good examples.

Either way, I think that could be a useful pattern to follow in a horror game.<br/><br/>(And in case anyone is curious, I believe Clute's four stages of Fantasy are Wrongness, Thinning, Recognition, Return.  And his Four inspirations for art are Disastrous love affair, terrible disease, dangerous addiction, travel.  But I haven't read the book myself, just heard Sean Stewart talk about it.)<br/><br/>The most interesting parts of horror in my view are the creepy part where you don't understand what's going on, or even have a framework to attempt understanding, and then later when the evil has a seductive allure.  I'm hoping Vincent's <em>Afraid</em> will capture that.  Fighting monsters with guns and explosives bores me to tears.  Fighting monsters by changing you you are, by giving up things that matter to you and embracing the unknown, that sounds like fun.  But maybe that's just me.<br/><br/>I have high hopes for Jon Walton's <em>Vesperteen</em> should it come to pass, bcause teens are already in the process of figuring out who they are and how they fit into the world as their brains settle in from 15 to 25, so they're natural candidates for horror protagonists.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104109/#Comment_104109" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T05:34:32+00:00" title="October 22, 2007  5:34AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is an interesting question, and one I've had to consider a lot lately with the 28 Days Later-inspired scenario for Dead of Night I've been running at conventions this year. Normally loss of survival points (which are hit points, sanity points and hero points, all in one) in combat in Dead of Night represent the bites, scratches and other cinematic-but-not-really-debilitating wounds that characters in a horror movie pick up.<br/><br/>But in 28 Days Later, getting bitten by the Infected means that you get the infection, and are fairly instantly out of the game. So I've made survival point loss about different things instead - npc companions dying, guns jamming, loss of weapons and equipment, the tyres on your car bursting as you escape.

When you lose one, you inch a little bit closer to being written out of the story, so they can represent anything that reduces your chance of survival - loss of sanity, health or resources. <br/><br/>You can also voluntarily spend them to do stuff too, and gain them for playing to genre cliches, but that's by the by in this discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104417/#Comment_104417" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T15:40:45+00:00" title="October 23, 2007  3:40PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andrew Kenrick</cite>They take the place of hit points, so when you lose a roll in combat you lose one.</blockquote>Mmm.

It's similar in style and content to horror movies like Descent, Slither, Creep, Blade 2, Dog Soldiers, Resident Evil, and John Carpenter's Vampires. While I like the suspenseful kind of horror movie in which the victims are ordinary people who get picked off, one by one, I also enjoy some good horror-action ass-kicking. <br/><br/>So the choices in Dread aren't predicated on the notion that one wrong move equals instant death -- they're mainly tactical decisions. Will you execute a stunt that inflicts grievous damage to both you and the enemy, even though it might result in your demise? Will you attack the demon, killing the possessed victim, or will you try to perform an exorcism, knowing that it may allow the demon to attack (and possibly kill) you and a member of your team?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104522/#Comment_104522" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T06:25:45+00:00" title="October 24, 2007  6:25AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, you're entirely right, and my choice of example (Dusk to Dawn) neatly contradicts my statement about "not very horror".

It's all the *other* kinds of horror game that represent more of a design challenge.

So, let me try again.<br/><br/>In Dead of Night, whenever a combat roll is made (for the werewolf to attack the victim, the vampire hunter to stake the vampire, the soldier to defend himself against the zombie, and so on), the loser loses a survival point.<br/><br/>This survival point loss is abstract, and can represent anything. Normally it will represent things like injuries.<br/><br/>But! In 28 Days Later if the Infected bite you, you turn into an Infected right away. So, when you lose a survival point in combat it has to represent something other than an injury - loss of allies, equipment, encroaching sanity etc etc.<br/><br/>When you're out of survival points, that's the point your life is actually on the line. That's when you get bit by the Infected and you too join their ranks.<br/><br/>Hope that makes sense - I just thought it was a (roundabout) way of illustrating how combat in a horror game can be about things other than injury and death, instead making it about chances of survival.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104537/#Comment_104537" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T07:08:55+00:00" title="October 24, 2007  7:08AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I get it.
