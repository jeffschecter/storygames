If a group is experienced in playing "prepped" games without prep, then I imagine they could apply their experience doing so with other games to Ryuutama easily, but there's not much in the way of mechanisms in the game as written to support doing this on the fly.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>The fundamental action resolution rules are not particularly complex. The core of the game (arguably) is found in its mechanical procedures to represent travel, which are somewhat in-depth; they only take up a couple of pages and you can probably fit the whole thing in an easy-to-read 1-page infographic to refer to during play, but it's not an insignificant amount of rolls to make and information to keep track of.<br/><br/>Narrative Authority:<br/>One of the game's core conceits, as I understand it, is that it was supposed to act as a tool to teach novice GMs about how to undertake that role in a gaming culture that is particularly GM-driven. The eponymous Dragon ("Ryuu") represents a set of GM-moves to be used during the course of the game and how they can influence its tone.<br/><br/>There are brief rules for communally creating the world, however, and the villages that the PCs travel through on the course of their adventures.<br/><br/>Indie:<br/>To the best of my knowledge the Japanese version is "indie" as far as it's creator's control over it goes (he even ended up releasing a pdf version for free after it went out of print). I guess I would class the English version as released by an "indie" publisher, though I feel like there is a semantic minefield to cross over in regards to what extent a translator is able to exercise control over something they're translating, or for which they have been granted a license the terms of which probably include at least some sort of limitation.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say that for all the boundaries that Ryuutama pushes, it's still very largely grounded in a "trad" "adventure game" RPG paradigm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469933/#Comment_469933" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-11T17:41:47+00:00" title="February 11, 2018  5:41PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great guys, that answered my question.
