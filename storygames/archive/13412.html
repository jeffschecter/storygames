The PDF is free to download from <a href="http://www.scribd.com/full/44072955?access_key=key-asfhz47l4piogogql10" rel="nofollow">Scribd here</a>. I'll be playtesting this like mad myself and taking this discussion over to Praxis, but I do have some specific questions for anyone who can read it over and if possible playtest:<br/><br/>- How does it read? Do the instructions for play make sense to you? What questions do you walk away from the document asking?<br/><br/>- If you know any of Moorcock's work do you think this meets the objective of creating a story game that will lead to stories with a similar feel?<br/><br/>- What do you think I've done wrong? Where have I missed a trick?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302361/#Comment_302361" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-26T13:49:25+00:00" title="November 26, 2010  1:49PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a big Elric fan and a smaller fan on Moorcock in general.  Your Law/Chaos/Balance stuff all sounds good to me, especially the open narration.  A player advocating for Chaos absolutely should be able to make the Champion do something!  My main worry/confusion is about how this gets decided moment-to-moment.

Hopefully the narration guide helps with this, but the player who's turn it is leads the narration for that "chapter" of the story and so has final say but can/should take input from the others. If this isn't clear then do say! <br/><br/>Also, I know there are a few spolling mistooks in the document; they will get tidied up shortly <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302421/#Comment_302421" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-27T11:21:04+00:00" title="November 27, 2010 11:21AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, let's say I'm playing Chaos, and it's my turn.  Do I have infinite authority over the Champion?  Can I make him, like, kill puppies for Chaos?  If the Champion player is saying, "No, dude, that ruins his whole concept!" is there any particular way for us to hash that out?  For example, maybe the Champion player would find the chaotic behavior more acceptable if I first established a curse, fugue, fever, demonic possession, or some other temporary, transfiguring condition.  But maybe leaving players to come up with that on their own isn't always a safe bet?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans" title="Tanya Fyans"><img alt="Tanya Fyans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans">Tanya Fyans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302424/#Comment_302424" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-27T11:37:07+00:00" title="November 27, 2010 11:37AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that is what I was aiming for with the "continuity" and "act as a team" rules talk, but perhaps I have to drill that down some. The dice roll takes care of the game part, I was aiming for folks to chip in to come up with a good story as to why that happened.

Like, if I come up with a really cool idea, and think I can use it, but then I try, and someone else isn't cool with it, and then we just kind of socially hash out which of us gets our way, then... well, I dunno, it seems unreliable.  It'd be better for me to know, as the cool idea is forming in my mind, what I do and don't have the ability to narrate in, or at least how that'll be determined (and thus my odds).<br/><br/>Perhaps good examples of edge cases in the "continuity" and "act as a team" text would help.<br/><br/>Or perhaps you could let people stake out inviolate areas, like, "Here's the list of 5 things you can't make my Champion do."<br/><br/>Or maybe spend tokens for vetoes, so you have a limited number, and will only use them when it counts.<br/><br/>Or maybe I'm taking this in an unnecessarily adversarial direction, and what you need is really just a system for building off each other's narrations, so no one's contributing something "out of the blue".  Maybe end each turn with a leading question that the next player must answer or follow up on?<br/><br/>Just some ideas.  It depends on what sort of social dynamic you're envisioning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302442/#Comment_302442" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-27T15:17:44+00:00" title="November 27, 2010  3:17PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 27, 2010 3:40PM by David_Berg.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Crap, I just realized we're supposed to do this sort of thing in Praxis.  <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Keith, if you start a thread there, I'll re-post there if you want.</span>  Oh, I see you have a thread there.
