                    I'm thinking of the game design and play implications of the <i>Perception</i> skill (sometimes an attribute or ability) commonly found in RPGs.<br/><br/>The existence of a score character Perception ability in a game suggests that the designer wanted it to be <i>important</i>. Less indirectly, such a game is set in a world where there are <i>things unseen</i>: secrets, spies, hidden doors, traps, stalkers, invisible creatures...<br/><br/>Ostensibly, the designer does not want them to be found <i>all the time</i>, and thus leaves finding these wondrous things <i>up to chance</i>. The cleric walks right past the secret door that leads to the treasure room, never to find it. Oh well!<br/><br/>I wonder if this idea is totally wrongheaded. What if characters just automatically find things? Does that spoil the game? <ul><li>You find the secret door to the treasure room! But you still need to get out of the dungeon alive.</li><li>You spot a giant pit trap in front of you. But you still must jump over it.</li><li>You spot a poison needle trap on that locked chest. But you still must unlock it and avoid getting pricked.</li><li>You notice someone tailing you. But you still must decide if letting them know you're onto them is a good idea, and possibly shake them or confront them.</li></ul>
I'm sure some sim-purists will say that just succeeding at noticing everything ruins the fun for them. I suspect that's a minority view though.<br/><br/>When you're creating a setting with all this hidden stuff, don't you really just want the characters to find it? How much prep gets wasted because someone fails their Spot check? Is it more dramatic to fall into a pit you didn't know was there, or to fall into a pit you saw and were trying to leap over?<br/> </div>

                            I hear you, Adam.<br/><br/>With most "Perception" challenges, there is almost always some other issue which would be far more interesting (and more gameable) to resolve.<br/><br/>(In player vs. player interactions, however, things can get more complicated... but that's a whole other question for designers.)                        </div>

                            I feel like the existence of "randomized perception" plays a big part in the emergent quality of play-to-find-out play. <br/><br/>Not-noticing doesn't have to mean wasted prep; if you fail to detect the person tailing you, that can have consequences down the line. Whether you see the pit trap or not, you'll still find it eventually: but the way you find it, the consequences, and how you ultimately deal with it, all change.                        </div>

                            I've also been watching a bit of Critical Role lately, as I've mentioned <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21370/critical-role-and-the-rise-of-d-d" rel="nofollow">in the other thread (about that)</a>, and that reminds me of another thing:<br/><br/>In a lot of trad games (D&amp;D, in this case), you are expected to roll Perception (or Insight, or Knowledge whatever) to discern some (often quite important) detail or bit of information.<br/><br/>For example, I played in a D&amp;D game where the party was spending a few days in a keep, in preparation for a War Against Great Evil. We were instructed to all make Perception checks to see if we could notice that there was something wrong/off/strange about the garrison of the keep. Were the soldiers sleeping there being affected by some curse?<br/><br/>This kind of "group Perception check" ritual is hilarious to me; it takes just a modicum of arithmetic to realize that it's basically pointless. (Assuming that the average character has a 50% chance of success - and it's normally higher! - a group like that on <i>Critical Role</i> has far less than a 1% chance of failing that test.)<br/><br/>And yet it persists. <br/><br/>Things I wonder about with Perception checks and such:<br/><br/>1. As <a href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">@yukamichi</a> writes, above, sometimes there ARE moments where knowing whether someone sees something or not is interesting. However, they are rare, not always easy to identify, and often really tricky to make "gameable" (e.g. the conundrum of having to roll to notice something makes it impossible not to realize that you missed something, and such).<br/><br/>How can we play or design towards that?<br/><br/>(The addition of "passive perception" to modern D&amp;D, for example, is a step in a positive direction. That helps resolve some of these issues.)<br/><br/>2. Were I designing a game of this sort right now, I would look towards having Perception checks and mechanical effects rather than a binary pass/fail.<br/><br/>For instance, perhaps we always narrate me noticing the assassin lurking behind me, but the outcome of the roll determines *how soon*, and whether that leaves me at an advantage or a disadvantage.<br/><br/>-"There is a noise behind you... you whirl to see that you've been followed! Roll Perception."<br/>-"Oh, good! I scored 3 successes."<br/>-"You hear him coming long before he gets close to you. You automatically win initiative against him and you have a +3 for whatever way you choose to react...:                        </div>

                            Group skill checks are a codified thing in 5e. If more than half the group succeeds, the overall check succeeds. If DMs are playing it as "if <i>anyone</i> succeeds..." then they're not playing RAW.<br/><br/>The former averages out PC skills to some extent (remember that you don't have to have proficiency in a skill to roll it). The latter basically is just instant success.<br/><br/>Anyone want to run the combinatorics math on the RAW method?                        </div>

                            (I don't want to get on a tangent, but how this might or might not be handled in D&amp;D5 still makes it a relevant issue to many/most games who use personal Perception checks! Do you use group checks in your D&amp;D games for this kind of thing?)<br/><br/>(I've yet to see a D&amp;D group handle Perception that way, in any case. The wording of the rules strongly suggests the authors of the game didn't intend that, either: <i>"Group checks <b>don't come up very often</b>, and they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group."</i> [emphasis mine]. Perception checks are, arguably, never something where the characters "succeed or fail as a group". In practice, it's a roll which gives us an excuse to say who notices something first, instead, which isn't terribly useful or inspiring.)                        </div>

                            What if something like a perception check is unknowingly most useful as a improv-enabling-delay for the GM. <br/><br/>Interesting question player, please manipulate a physical object and then do some mental arithmetic whilst I think of a good answer.<br/><br/>I wonder how many rules have a physical place in the conversation, as pacing or turn taking method, that gives them popularity beyond any thematic or mechanical use.

                            If I'm correct, original 'perception' checks were used to allow automatic discovery. If the DM rolled a 1, you automatically found the trap door, and she narrated the new room that way.<br/><br/>Otherwise you had to use your player skills. Maybe the GM gave you some hint for free, maybe not.<br/><br/>Then came the Thief. Then came the general ability/skill etc.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Group perception checks are basically for spicing up gameplay, right?                        </div>

                            Group perception checks -  I play in a Pathfinder group where the DM often calls for this kind of seemingly pointless perception check, where he wants to introduce some new thing to the scene and knows that someone in the group will inevitably succeed on the roll to spot it.<br/><br/>For a long time I thought this was pretty strange procedure, and wondered why he was doing it.  Why not just narrate the appearance of the new thing?  But eventually I noticed he was using it in a different way than I thought.  He isn't calling to see if anyone in the group notices the new thing, but to see <i>which</i> characters notice it, or which character notices it first.<br/><br/>For example, if there is a satyr watching the party from the bushes, then he might call for everyone to make a perception check.  Perhaps we go around the table and roll 19, 38, 27, 24 (it's Pathfinder, so big numbers).  The the DM addresses the guy who rolled 38 and says, "Orchadia, you notice a pair of eyes watching from the bushes.  What do you do?"  The player who is playing Orchadia gets to take the lead in the new scene (and probably decide the direction for the whole party's interaction with the Satyr) because of the high perception roll.<br/><br/>So, in this usage, it acts like Initiative not just in a ritualistic sense, but in the sense that it is a roll to see who gets to take action.  This isn't a formal rule by any means, but just a result of the fact that the DM addresses the narration to only the player with the high perception roll.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I've seen that a lot, too. It makes some more sense when there is a significant decision to be made, which can be made by a single character, but those situations (in my experience) are fairly rare (the players will typically want to share the information and deliberate).<br/><br/>The idea of using that to shift spotlight is interesting; that has some potential.                        </div>

                            In some groups, perception rolls are used to establish who is flat-footed or surprised at the start of unexpected combat--that is, as a second layer of complexity on any initiative rules (or in lieu of them). <br/><br/>This can have the sim-beneficial result of alert, scout-types having a moment to shine (spotlighting) as well as potentially providing substantial mechanical advantage (e.g. in games where a fast *sleep* spell or alpha strike missile or whatever can massively swing the battle).                        </div>

                            Note that in 5E, you can essentially just invest enough character resources to eventually make this sort of thing a non-issue: high Wisdom, find a way to get double-Proficiency in Perception, and take the Alert feat, and you're looking at a Passive Perception of perhaps 25 by mid-level. It's an interesting example of that sort of "reverse flagging" that is sometimes discussed, where someone takes a high Sword skill because they want fights to be over quickly.<br/><br/>I have seen this phenomenon in play, and it's not disruptive at all, and indeed heightens the drama in general, as Adam suggests in his post.<br/><br/>Now, let's talk about Insight, the lie-detecting equivalent of Perception. There things get really thorny, because it's easier to imagine a situation where not knowing someone is lying to you is dramatically interesting. But then if you made the roll, you know there's something to be Insightful about, which then means the player if not the character has a sense of what's up. There are various ways around it, but I've played enough Dogs to generally just let players know when an NPC is lying.                        </div>

                            Perception as a skill is the most wrongheaded thing D&amp;D ever did. I'm hacking 5e and considering getting rid of a few skills - except Perception. I'm not considering getting rid of it, I <i>know</i> I'm getting rid of it. It's like the 5e "survivalist" (or w/e it's called) background's ability to get as much food as a party needs at all times. It's not actually an ability that impacts play so much as it's an ability that turns off parts of play.<br/><br/>You get rid of Perception and you go one of two ways: 1) let the PCs notice everything, as you've said, Adam, or 2) force the PCs to describe what they are doing and looking at and have them find what they find.                        </div>

                            I remember when I was a teenager game mastering trad games. I always had the characters Perception based skills written down so I could roll for them in secret. Then I realized I could roll for them in advance because I knew what kind of situations they would get into, and then just hand over the information or prepare for what would happen if everyone failed their skill roll.<br/><br/>It got a little weird sometimes, where I told X players about something, and then the rest had to pretend to not see it (I even tried notes). I then took this a step further, by just having their Perception values and give out information to the players based on their scores, and assume that everyone said whatever they found. If they didn't then the player had to specifically say that.                        </div>

There were something that stroke me as weird, but I couldn't put my finger on it.

<a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a>, this is a question I have wrestled with more times than I can count. 
<blockquote>What if characters just automatically find things? Does that spoil the game?<br/></blockquote>
That certainly depends on the game everyone's playing. If you're playing a game with a separation between GM knowledge and PC knowledge and that distinction contributes to challenge-oriented gameplay, then it does spoil the game. Playing toward more story-based sensibilities, where the game is about crafting an interesting narrative, then no, it does not.<br/><br/>The issue, more broadly, is the function of Perception. What does Perception do, exactly? It's a skill, not a saving throw, so it implies that it is proactive rather than reactive. Except it's usually rolled to defend oneself against would-be ambushers or avoid stumbling into traps. D&amp;D likewise lacks a way to use it in a more narrative fashion; there is no option to roll Perception to do things that would propel or change the game world. In Fate, for example, you might roll your Notice to create an Aspect on a scene, but there's no option (save for the GM's whim) for a player to say, "I roll Perception to notice a weak spot in his armor."

                            Having the most alert character roll is a good approach/hack.<br/><br/>I just watched a scene from Critical Role where the party is trying to get a statue out of their way so they can move into a space.  First, the strongest characters player roles. He misses! Then the second strongest rolls. She misses too!  Next, three characters attempt it together. I'm not sure if it's considered a group check or not. But, in any case, they miss as well.  Finally. One of the least likely to succeed characters rolls, and they succeed. The statue is moved! <br/><br/>( I do wonder what would have happened of they all failed…)                         </div>

                             Here is something I think about a lot when it comes to perception: <br/><br/>What is the role of the perception check in noticing things?<br/><br/>There are different ways to apply the roll: for instance, as a "gate" or as a "saving throw".<br/><br/>These are quite different in practice, and choosing the right one can solve some gameplay issues.<br/><br/>Let me explain what I mean:<br/><br/>In the first view, it's a gate or limiter. We use it to gauge what the player knows.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>"There is a red skull in the room. Any player rolling a 20 or better will learn about the skull. Otherwise, it remains a secret."<br/><br/>You must have a character with good Perception, in other words, to discover certain information in the game.<br/><br/>The second approach is treating it like a saving throw:<br/><br/>You, the player, can learn just about anything about the world by interacting with it. However, we recognize that your character is smart, too, and if YOU missed something, we can roll Perception to see if YOUR CHARACTER missed it, too.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>"There is a red skull in the room, hidden under a cloth wrapping. Any player looking at the cloth wrapping finds the skull. However, characters rolling a 20 or better also figure this out automatically."<br/><br/>Being clear and being intelligent about which to use can solve some Perception conundrums in play.                        </div>

                            Best case, I'd say the Perception roll determines between "the next thing will be much easier for the PCs than it could have been" and "the next thing will be much harder for the PCs than it could have been", and the whole group is excited to see that roll result, even if only the GM knows <i>exactly</i> what the stakes were.<br/><br/>If you GM this way, be very clear about distinguishing <i>those</i> Perception rolls from Perception rolls which simply randomize for the GM when they should deliver which trivia.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm not big into Perception checks, because I don't generally get too excited about random inputs into my GMing, and I also prefer that "easy vs hard" be determined by things other than skill scores and luck.  But that's just me.  I certainly see how others enjoy this.<br/><br/>In the framing Adam offered, though, where it's a world of cool secrets begging to be discovered, then yeah, failing to do that because of a bad roll seems dumb.                        </div>

Depends on which sort of competence fantasy more floats your boat, I guess...                        </div>

                            I don't know. If the things they are discovering aren't cool secrets, who cares? "Some with high stakes" means cool secrets, doesn't it? Are uncool secrets "to be anticipated and appreciated accordingly"? Why?<br/><br/>I think there's some Actor-stance value to information-hiding but it takes more work. FREX: The GM doesn't tell the player that the guy is the villain, and then <i>passes notes</i> to other players who made their Perception checks. (Saying "Bob and Vinesh recognize him as the villain, but Ji-Woo does not" forces Ji-Woo's player from Actor stance to Author stance, so you pass a note instead.)<br/><br/> </div>

                            I think the purpose I'm pointing out is basically an additional vector for high-gamble challenge-based play.  Like, y'know, if your Sneak and To Hit rolls aren't enough stat-modified uncertainty, here's some Luck or Perception too!<br/><br/>I'm not sure whether the hidden door to the easier dungeon path counts as a "cool secret" or not.  To me it's more a useful resource.<br/><br/>If the GM's intent was not to randomize player odds of success in finding useful resources, but rather to provide an aesthetically striking revelation, then yeah, of course, don't gate <i>that</i> behind a Perception roll.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            I actually have a perfect example of this, from actual play. This is a moment from <i>Critical Role</i>. The party is interacting with an old lady behind bars, and are slightly suspicious about her.<br/><br/>One of the characters approaches to unlock the door (although she's pretending), and the old lady walks over to give her a hand. A Perception check is called for. Note the reactions of all the players! It's a signal that Something Is Not What it Seems.<br/><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-B5sUXSaTHKc?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5sUXSaTHKc"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/B5sUXSaTHKc/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/>The link takes you to the right spot; watch for just over a minute.<br/><br/>What can we take away from this?<br/><br/>I can start with a few:<br/><br/>* It's certainly a total loss of agency, for the players (and, to a lesser extent, perhaps the GM). There are no decisions being made here, as DeReel points out, above.<br/><br/>* The ritual of the Perception roll heightens suspense, and then allows the GM to deliver a reveal. However, in some ways the die roll makes the reveal feel slightly more "earned", perhaps, than if the GM simply said so outright. Does it obfuscate the process here somewhat? (After all, it was the GM who had the old lady step forward to handle the lock - clearly this was a setup, in other words, to deliver the reveal, which in no way has to do with the players' decisions or actions - but perhaps the roll makes it *feel* like it "just happened", and the players got lucky.)<br/><br/><i>I have no idea what would have happened if the roll had failed; I'll cross-post this in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21370/critical-role-and-the-rise-of-d-d" rel="nofollow">the Critical Role thread</a> to see if anyone has some insights on <b>that</b> over there.</i><br/><br/><br/>Edit: if the time stamp isn't working for you, link points to the video at 3:32:40.                        </div>

(emphasis mine)<br/><br/>I also think that, to some extent, the "mechanicalization of descriptive exploration" can be a beneficial crutch for people who want something that resembles the sort of play where exploration-challenge is important, but don't want the vagary that can come with it. It's "fair" in a way that having to play the "What is the GM thinking?" guessing game often feels not to be. It allows access to a similar experience for people who may not have/don't want to develop the skills that that sort of play can often hinge heavily on. To some people it may retain the "immersive magic" in a way that having to system-master an optimized, every-five-feet dungeon exploration protocol might not be.                        </div>

                            I agree that the role of the Perception Check is underexamined, but it's more than just a delaying tactic or a ritual. Even the "group perception" check where someone is almost always guaranteed to succeed positions the characters differently when:<br/><br/>* responding to threats; you made the perception check so you may act in the surprise round<br/>* receiving facts about a competitive situation; you made the perception check so you get an advantage over your fellow players you can exploit<br/>* fun; you made the perception check so you get an additional experience that's just yours, a little gambling burst of pleasure, like winning $5 on a slot machine so you'll invest $5000 in the evening<br/>* thematic appropriateness; you made the perception/knowledge/investigation check in this Lovecraftian horror game, so the forbidden knowledge the other characters avoid in their ignorance worms its way into your mind where it will never leave<br/>* character focus; your character expresses their interests by what they examine closely and the perception check is a low-friction way of getting those interests more front and center in the game<br/><br/>(Of course, in streaming, it's different, and the horror and misery of this realization should be palpable. That GM is asking a player to do a thing not for the GM, the player, the mechanics, or the fiction, but for "the streaming audience", slavering, hulking, numbering in the millions - billions yet unborn - all desperate to be sold Dungeons and Dragons, white supremacy, and Chryslers, yet needing to be massaged with a well-timed Perception check so they will agree to return, agree to click another button, agree to watch another ad, agree to back another Patreon, agree to follow on another social media platform? This is what I got into RPGs to avoid, to flee. But I have not run far enough, nor fast enough, and I should have known the money would always be faster...)<br/> </div>

                            This thread, recent personal experiences and reflecting on past experiences kept me thinking. I rely a lot on the perception roll to determine when and how much hidden data I reveal to the players. When and how much become decisive to define how good is an opportunity (finding the hidden door that leads to the boss room in the first room or after they defeated the boss), if resources like time/light get wasted or not, how dangerous can a situation become (they perceive assassin coming closer vs. they find out when they feel the cold of a knife on their neck) etc.<br/><br/>The mechanic works in a way. Calling for a perception roll signals players that something is going on. But having Perception be an stat ruins things either if the stat is too high or if it's too low. I'd like to keep all the things I stated on the previous paragraph if possible, minus the stat/roll. Here's an approach:<br/><br/>Players get a brief list of things their character may be focusing on at any given time. The list can be class-related or just be generic. When the GM calls for perception, a player can focus on two things from that list and maybe a general direction. If it's a group perception, then it's three things and two general directions. The list would be something like:<br/><br/>-Checking for movement<br/>-Checking for anything resembling a distinct shape (humanoid, beast, object, trap, you name it)<br/>-Listening<br/>-Navigating the place (make sure you don't get lost, keep track of obstacles and escape routes)<br/>-Checking for important details (misterious engravings, drawings, marks, tracks, etc.)<br/>-Checking for odors.<br/><br/>The GM may decide on the spot or in prep what of those things will reveal the hidden information, which reveal a distraction and which reveal nothing strange according to the nature of the challenge. Nice side effect: the GM can ask the players what are they checking for in the same way as asking them their marching order without spoiling too much the existence of hidden info. Players are free to change their focus any time, but only counts before the hidden data is revealed. I'm wondering if something similar could be done with Empathy.                        </div>

Yeah, we talked above about how one of the strengths of getting rid of Perception is just that now you can give players information.<br/><br/>Thanks for the link though!<br/> </div>

Never had such problem whenever I used Perception checks, but I did notice that failing perception checks too often quickly becomes frustrating, as the only answer the player gets from engaging the enviroment in different ways is just a "no, you don't see anything strange". The player knows there's something there because the GM won't usually call for Perception rolls for nothing, but there's no way to find out since the rolls were too low.<br/><br/>Perception rolls do have other uses as signals from both the GM and the players, but if the result of such rolls are going to be just "yes, here's some new data" and "no, there isn't", instead of something interesting happening when there's no data, then it's kind of a boring dice roll.                        </div>

                            I'm surprised no one has commented on my distinction between "gate" vs "saving throw" Perception rolls.<br/><br/>It's a pretty important point, I think, in terms of technique. <br/><br/>For instance, using the "saving throw" approach in situations where the fiction is vague enough that we can't determine whether the character might pick up on something the player isn't aware of could be an important part of certain playstyles, and helpful to the group.<br/><br/>I also liked the "roll to determine how many details you learn" used in Storming the Wizard's Tower. That has some potential, as well.                        </div>

                            If you're after tactical situations and surprise, the fiction shouldn't be vague. If the system sells tactics and doesn't equip the players with the correct tools, it's not doing it's job.<br/><br/>If I'd go the "saving throw" route, I'd rather make it like in the hero system, where you can only attack and defend with that many senses. It becomes a mini-game of three card Monte, rather than a roll. But Judd's take is more interesting : playing the mini game in the situation, rather than at character creation. I have made a mini-game for this in the thread "Immersion vs Identification".                        </div>

                            I think you're familiar with Champions. Remember how you can have a flash or invisibility or an opaque entangle. You could use it against that many senses. Or even for normal powers, you had to make them "visible" to some senses. The game for the playerwho wants to be "perceptive" is then to enhance a few senses. The question was less by how much (perception is cheap for a superhero) and rather what senses you could "cover". IR vision and sonar could be like 2 points cheap. Total spatial awareness that won the monte game most of the time was worth 30 points. I use the monte game analogy, because you have to guess where the opponent had put their attacks and defense. Basically, I could say that the sense costs came with a whole strategy about them.                         </div>

                            Thanks, DeReel! I've never played Champions but the "guess which strategies your opponent has access to" makes sense to me. Should I invest in sonar or echolocation, in case my enemy can create smoke, blocking vision? Stuff like that. Cool.                        </div>

                            In order to make Perception an “active” skill, I’ve folded into it the ability to overhear noises without drawing attention to oneself. Pressing one’s ear to the dungeon door gives muffled sound, but quietly opening the door gives a much clearer view of what’s going on. This requires a Perception roll, which both determines the quality of information obtained and the likelihood of being noticed while eavesdropping. Most GMs likely would require a Stealth roll to do this quietly, but I don’t see the purpose except for making it more likely that the PCs will be noticed and thus engage the combat engine. Seems rather unfair to make Stealth (and by extension, Dexterity) even more necessary for survival, too.<br/><br/>Regarding the AW-LotFP moves, I like them a bit, but I don’t think they mesh well with the system as-is. There’s a reason that you read a charged situation and not “size a situation up” (and a 6- is much worse in that regard than “gawping,” however much I enjoy that phrasing).<br/><br/>Aside: I think a DW hack that specifically focused on dungeon delving rather than more generic adventuring would be worth exploring and not so much reinventing the wheel as inventing snow tires, if that at all makes sense.                        </div>

                            I am in total agreement with Katana here : if it's going to be tactical, or any form of compelling play, "perceiving" as got to be a meaningful choice. To see or not to be seen. To hear and not to see or to see and not to hear. To talk or to hear. All meaningful choices. And if they don't happen only at character creation, better so.<br/>Btw, gawping is really a hard move in pop culture.

                            Another thought on this in 5e:<br/><br/>Passive Perception is a peculiar situation where it functions as “AC vs. Stealth” and as a skill floor (can’t roll below this). I think this is a rather shoddy design (no other skills have passive versions or skill floors), but it’s one that evidences the importance of the skill: the designers call special attention to it by creating mechanics that are exceptions to the rest of the system.                        </div>

                            The way I see Perception checks is they're only useful when there is time pressure and the players have to decide how much time they spend searching for traps/secret doors/hidden devil's horns before moving on. Or, as in the case of Apocalypse World, where failing the roll has a cost. Sticking your head out of cover to get a read on your opponents might reveal your position to them, or leave you squinting long enough that they shoot you.<br/><br/>Dungeon crawling (where the system usually has some sort of perception check) I usually don't use it though, only having 1/6 in finding a secret door even when searching the right spot is lame, I only roll when there is only visual inspection for reasons of extreme paranoia or distance.                        </div>

                            Having to spend precious time on searching and a having cost for failure seem like the best conditions for these kinds of test.<br/><br/>Torchbearer handles these perception checks quite well, I think.<br/><br/>1.  If the player describe an insight that would help them notice what they're looking for quickly, it's a "Good idea".  They get all the information right away, without a roll.  (e.g. "I check this statue for moving parts.  Maybe it has a hidden lever?"  or "I look to see if she's wearing a ring like the other cultists")<br/><br/>2. The GM only class for a Scout roll based on how player describes what they're doing.  No "You enter the dark room.  Make a scout check."  If they say they're looking for a hidden key somewhere in the barn, then you check the difficulty and have them roll.<br/><br/>3. All rolls, pass or fail count toward the grind.  Every four rolls, everyone marks a condition.  So spending time searching is a tactical decision with transparent stakes.  There's no negotiation about how long it would take, etc.  You only search for something if you think it's worth a turn.<br/><br/>4.  If you fail, then there is a twist or condition.  On a twist, you fail and some new danger is introduced.  Broken gear, wandering monster, or a trap is triggered.  If the GM chooses (based on pacing and the importance of the information to the Player's agenda) then of 'twisting', she can say the player succeeds at the task but earns a condition.  Conditions are sometimes punishing, especially as they add up, but the player gets their intent.<br/><br/>I've occasionally had push-back from players used to D&amp;D: "Looking around a room can make a situation <i>worse</i>?"  But the absence of illusory stakes from these situations is really refreshing to me.                        </div>

In old school D&amp;D the cost is very noticable. My players are very careful not to look around too carefully if they have a goal other than general exploration in mind as they know both the risk of wandering monsters but also just triggering dangers such as traps or inert enemies.<br/><br/> </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Krippler">@Krippler</a> Yeah, the Torchbearer procedures are definitely Moldvay-era inspired. I do think the TB rules stand out for their transparency. Having a procedure of turns, and conditional success, help players (or at least me as a player) feel able to make calculated risks.                        </div>

                            I think transparency is of the utmost importance with any rules system. Particularly with Perception rules. If Perception rules are opaque, then how the hell can you see their inner workings? <br/><br/>*rimshot* <br/><br/>But seriously, just like with any other rule, a game's mechanical procedures for figuring out how characters learn information about their environment send a message to the people playing the game about the role that senses and intuition play in the story, the world, the genre, or what have you. <br/><br/>Dungeon World's Discern Realities move gives players that succeed on a roll the chance to learn more about the situation around them, prepare for what's coming next, and get a bonus when they incorporate what they learned into future actions. It's message is "Perception is a problem solving tool, a way to gain information and advantage that would otherwise be impossible."<br/><br/>Torchbearer and B/X with the Grind, Twists, and Conditions or Turns/Wandering Monster rolls send the clear message "Perception is a way to offset the horrible risks of diving into monster-infested hellholes. But it has a cost: in time, in risk to the scout, and in the chances that 2d4 ghouls might come on by looking for a snack." <br/><br/>Fate sends a very different message with it's rules for incorporating reasonable new details into the fiction with a successful Create Advantage roll. It sends the message "Noticing things is a way of showing off my character's backstory and personality, based on what they notice, how they notice it, and how they turn it to their advantage." The Eager Young Revolutionary who Notices that there is a Little Used Back Alley that might allow her fellows to creep unseen towards the Bastille is way different from the Ragged Sellsword who Notices that the champion he's fighting is using armor that's Too Ostentatious For It's Own Good: a vulnerability he can exploit with deft maneuvering. <br/><br/>5th edition D&amp;D (as with many aspects of it's design) doesn't really set up a clear message as to what Perception is for. It's there because it was there in previous editions and is something people expect to be in their D&amp;D. It's not there as a strategic choice with a clear risk and reward. It's not there because it allows players to express their character's Special Thing (as it doesn't let players contribute to the fiction in the way that something like Persuasion or Deception might, by avoiding a fight or making an ally). It doesn't even grant a clear advantage: because of the way success and failure are set up the information you gain from Perception might be stuff that you already know, and doesn't grant any superior position to act on it. It's just kinda...there. <br/><br/>So I think the key to designing transparent and functional Perception rules are to ask "What sort of clear (ha) message do I want to send regarding what it means to sense stuff? What role does figuring things out play in this genre, in this type of story, for the goals that players are supposed to have?" <br/><br/>A few random Perception rules:<br/><br/>"If you question the truth of a matter, roll Perception. On a success, name one thing that's absolutely true and one thing that's definitely a lie. These can't be contradicted unless someone Reveals a Secret that overturns Everything We Thought We Knew. On a failure, turn to the player whose character you trust least and have them do it." <br/>-Perception is a tool for figuring how what is real and what's a lie. But it's illusory: at any moment, someone might undo everything you thought you knew." <br/><br/>"When you're faced with the Old Ones, take as much or as little Preparedness as you wish. So long as you have at least 1, you're not caught at the Horror's mercy. Spend Preparedness 1 for 1 to get bonuses on rolls or trigger a flashback. For every Preparedness you take, sacrifice 1 Sanity. You automatically notice anything normal coming at you. Your eyes are all too open."-Being Perceptive means losing your hold on reality. Being ready for horrible things means being constantly on edge. What matters during play is dealing with otherworldly horrors (and going crazy in the process) <br/><br/> </div>

                            I looked at the D&amp;D Basic Rules Version 1.0, looking for Perception stuff:
<blockquote><b>Finding a Hidden Object</b><br/><br/>When your character searches for a hidden object such as<br/>a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make<br/>a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to<br/>find hidden details or other information and clues that you<br/>might otherwise overlook.<br/><br/>In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking<br/>in order for the DM to determine your chance of success.<br/>For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes<br/>in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you<br/>pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for<br/>clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of<br/>your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to<br/>specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the<br/>bureau in order to have any chance of success.</blockquote>
Interesting that they talk about having to describe what you are doing and how you are doing it in order to bring the roll about.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Blegh.  Mixing active/passive, leisurely/time-pressured, and targeted/broad searches all together makes my head hurt.<br/><br/>I'd rather separate such things.<br/><br/><b>Thorough Search</b> - You find everything there is to find.  Roll to see how long it takes; or don't (as it's clearly not <i>important</i>).<br/><br/><b>Timed Search</b> - Declare what you're searching for.  Then declare how long you'll search, in either number of minutes (e.g. 30 mins) or in terms of other developments (e.g. until the gnolls break through the door), which the GM may roll for (e.g. gnolls arrive in 2d6 rounds).  Then roll to see what you find during that time.  
<ul><li>If you are searching for a specific thing, the GM will determine a target number for success (if possible during the time window). </li>
<li>If you are searching for whatever you can find, the GM will decide what a perfect roll will yield in this situation, and then dole out portions of that according to the actual roll.</li></ul>
<b>Notice</b> - When the GM wants to know whether your character might spot a surprise attack, or an environmental feature they aren't looking for, the GM requests a roll.<br/><br/>You could use your Perception stat for any, all, or none of these, depending on what you want "Perception" to mean in your game.                        </div>

Requiring specific descriptions to be allowed a chance for failure seems like the worst of both worlds to me: like D&amp;D 5E's disadvantage, you take the worse of the player's skill and the character's skill.                        </div>

I'd say it doesn't have to be one or the other. Recon 5e doesn't state it as a rule, neither too many indies, yet it makes sense that the whole mechanic should be: <i>If the player's description of their character actions doesn't seem to make the outcome predictable, roll as established.</i> </div>

I think this little Finding a Hidden Object note is a mistake because it runs a bit counter to the rest of the design. It says "typically" because it's kind of a catch-all description of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what people have been observed doing with D&amp;D</span>. But the rest of the rules do a fine job of explaining how Exploring works and they make an okay distinction between Investigation and Perception while leaving almost everything else up to discretion and whatever level of granularity the GM and players have established.<br/><br/>It would be extremely weird to play a game in which most scenes convey only the most essential heart of the situation, and then, suddenly, need to go into those apparently "typical" specifics. And, in my experience, most people play most editions of D&amp;D in an organic way that stretches, but tends to quickly snap back to the most essential heart of every situation. When a player wants to get more surgical, most competent dungeon masters either respond in kind OR make it clear there's nothing there. And when a dungeon master wants the players to get more surgical, they funnel the players towards that level of detail with description and questions.<br/><br/>Many players certainly do use D&amp;D to perform Swords &amp; Sorcery Minesweeper, but that's definitely not the default position of the game. Given the ways I see people play at conventions and actual plays, I'd say that approach is fringe enough that the Finding a Hidden Object note is dissonant with both the rest of the text <i>and</i> the culture.                        </div>

                            It depends what you mean.

What I mean is that level of granularity occurs perhaps every session or many times per session according to what's organically appropriate, but is not the default or even most typical position of the game. But that little text box about Finding a Hidden Object implies it is. And I think the rest of the text suggests that how specific one must be is necessarily relative rather than being prescriptive.                        </div>

                            I -sort of- tested yesterday the mechanic I mentioned <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/479230/#Comment_479230" rel="nofollow">here</a> before and realized how ingrained the perception roll is in my mind and how lots of the things mentioned before actually happen in the game.<br/><br/>For starters, whenever perception was triggered in the game, 70% of the time I just stated what did the characters see because it was optimal to keep the story rolling, it made sense in the fiction and/or failing to perceive anything, while it meant the next challenge would be harder, looked more like a speedbump instead.<br/><br/>The other 30% of the time were two instances in where 1)a player wanted to read an opponent to determine his intentions. 2)another player was looking for the entrance to a hideout using thermal sensors, while being ambushed by insurgents with appropiate equipment. However in these occasions I didn't hade explicit prep made for this, so I ended up asking players to roll the die after engaging with the mechanic<i> to oracle the dice.</i> (hence the "sort of tested" above)<br/><br/> </div>

                            I apologize if this is somewhat orthogonal, but does anybody have any insight about the general history of these different kinds of codified Perception mechanics?<br/><br/>I know in D&amp;D that the rolls explicitly for secret doors and for finding traps date back quite far, but for me personally I recall being super intrigued by the introduction of the "Spot" and "Listen" skills in 3E, and the implications they had for a passive, mechanics-mediated system of determining how to introduce information into the game. As innocuous as it may have felt in presentation (just another skill in a big list of skills), in retrospect (as this thread attests, I believe) it actually looks like it's practically a cornerstone of a certain kind of play, an integral part of mediating GM-player-world interactions; are there any really notable antecedents in the rules of pre-3E games?                        </div>

                            Yeah, that's a good point.<br/><br/>I can think of two things:<br/><br/>Early versions of D&amp;D had rules for "listening at a door", which was usually handled as a straight 1 in 6 roll (though thieves could be better at it, depending on the ruleset). A very specific action, like many things in early D&amp;Ds, for handling dungeon crawling.<br/><br/>By the time we got Advanced D&amp;D, I remember alternate rulesets appearing which renamed the basic ability scores and some popular ones included a "Perception" stat, either added to the others or replacing Wisdom. (Another popular one was separating "Charisma" from "Comeliness", so you could have a Charismatic but ugly wizard, for instance.)<br/><br/>I don't remember ever seeing terribly clear rules for how to use the Perception ability score, though - presumably the group just would figure out when to ask for a Perception check on its own.                        </div>

                            I'm also curious about non-D&amp;D games, for what it's worth.<br/><br/>2nd Edition Mechwarrior (1991) has this to say, for example:
<blockquote>Perception Rolls give the gamemaster a good way to keep a story moving and to tell the players what their characters see and when they see it. Be careful not to overuse Perception Rolls, however, or they will bog down the flow of play. As with everything else, resort to game mechanics only when the outcome is uncertain.</blockquote>
And I suspect it's probably not the first example of a game text talking explicitly about Perception rolls as a GM tool.                        </div>

                            I apologize for resurrecting this thread, but I read an article by Alexis Smolensk (Tao of D&amp;D blogger) who <a href="http://tao-dnd.blogspot.com/2019/02/perception-checks.html" rel="nofollow">critiques Perception in modern D&amp;D</a>:
<blockquote>The DM describes anything: a room, an opponent, a landscape, the thorn in the player's foot ... and the player answers, "I want to make a perception check."<br/><br/>Effectively, the player is asking, "I want more information than you're giving me."  By using the perception roll, the player means to use the rules of the game to force the DM to give more information; or, in the case of looking for a weak spot in the armor of an opponent, a flaw in a non-player's argument or evidence of some kind, the player wishes to force the DM to give the player an advantage.<br/><br/>So DM's learn to describe part of what the player ought to see, knowing the players will make a perception check, so that the DM can then tell the rest of the story.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>More information is obtained by changing your physical position; by using your other senses to investigate it or by poking at it with a stick of by some other test.  In other words, by taking an action, which the player designates.  NOT by looking harder or hearing harder without actually changing anything about the situation you've already perceived.</blockquote> </div>

                            I almost posted it there because it seemed so relevant, but I did not wish to divert the discussion from Insight. Smolensk's take on gaining more information doesn't use the exact phrase "fictional triggers," but it's there in the description of activities that might gain more information.<br/><br/>Certain limitations to this process exist. The GM is privileged with knowledge the players are not, and so the players might not perform the necessary fictional triggers to glean additional knowledge. This seems a failing to me, but it is probably working as intended to Smolensk. Is there a way to blend the modern approach of Perception check for more information and the traditional approach of fictional triggers?<br/><br/>Example: a room with a burning brazier that has a hidden staircase that will be revealed when the brazier is twisted upon its base.<br/><br/>#1: "I search for a hidden door." This would typically invoke a Perception/Investigate check, at least with the way that most GMs end up playing.<br/><br/>#2: "I look at the brazier to see if there's anything unusual about it." This would also typically invoke a Perception/Investigate check in most games. A success might locate the mechanism that opens the secret door.<br/><br/>#3: "I douse the brazier." This is the wrong fictional trigger in the right location. It does not locate the door. Personally, I might treat this interaction with the environment as allowing a Perception check to notice the mechanism as in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.<br/><br/>#4: "I twist the brazier upon its base." This would automatically succeed.<br/><br/>None of this feels quite satisfactory to me.                        </div>

I can’t help but wonder if, in this case, the GM is actually undecided about whether such a book is present, and having the player roll to determine the fictional reality. I’ve seen similar things done in other games. <br/> </div>

                            I think that's quite common in D&amp;D, but only when the presence of such a book isn't important to the ongoing action.<br/><br/>Say, looking for a heretical scripture in someone's personal library to establish whether they're a heretic or not (establish as in [i]shape[/i] the fictional reality, as opposed to [i]find out[/i] the shape of the fictional reality) is very unlikely in a D&amp;D game about sniffing out heresy.<br/><br/>Looking for a heretical scripture in someone's personal library to highlight that your character is into obscure texts, while the game is about, say, warring thieves' guilds: fairly likely.                        </div>

I think perceiving objects that are perceptible is not a given, and that's why rolls exist. (They're just not always interesting gaming.)<br/><br/>For example, there's a secret message scratched onto a brick in a large room. A highly perceptive character would (might?) see it. An average character would not. I think Alexis expects a player to first say, "I'll examine the walls," and then he'll give them the information. I'm not sure how fun that is in play because it trains the players to examine everything in detail, one thing at a time.                        </div>

                            Sorry, do you mean you have major truths in the fiction decided by skill check succes, with minor ones just declared without a roll?<br/><br/>Or major points can't be decided by skill checks (like my heretic in the first example), minor points can be decided, and really minor, cosmetic points are just declared?                        </div>

Yeah, I think the only time looking for something is cool is when it's dramatic, like when, using Adam's example, you're looking for powdered garlic when a vampire is approaching(pressed for time and dramatic in play), when used as a prompt for more description from the DM, or when it gives a benefit to further action. <br/><br/>I mean, if failure's dramatic, then why leave it up to chance?  A lot of the time, it seems that game is at odds with the swing of drama.  But, I get it - it's that strangely fertile  mule, the rpg.<br/> </div>

I think it's sometimes lazy to use the unknown as the source of drama, instead of the way there.  It's the means to something, not that something.  The unknown is the carrier, not the message.  <br/> </div>

                            And I don't buy that things are dramatic because they're unknown.

Why are none of these satisfactory? Let's figure out what the goal here is, first. (Roleplayers often fall into the trap of wanting everything at once, which makes it basically impossible to come up with a solution that works.)<br/><br/>What's the ideal play here, what does it look like?                        </div>

For me to make it satisfactory it would be more like:<br/><br/>#1: "I search for a hidden door." This would make me as a GM ask "How and where in the room?" expecting them to inspect and interact more with the elements in the room, even if there isn't such thing as a hidden door. If the player answer is vague or generic I'd let them roll the dice but use a high difficulty, as it will become obvious that they just want to rush the story forward. Depending on how much they want to rush it, their degree of frustration will make evident I'd probably just let them find it or mahe something else happen instead.<br/><br/>#2: "I look at the brazier to see if there's anything unusual about it." Now THIS would invoke a Perception/Investigate check for me, with a normal or low difficulty. Or if the PC is near enough or the player gestures how they look for clues and it makes sense they find something, I'd give them another clue: "You find marks on the floor that suggests this brazier's base has been twisted on the same spot a few times".<br/><br/>#3: "I douse the brazier." This is the wrong fictional trigger in the right location, but the way it's done it still can trigger a perceptopn roll. This roll, with a normal or low difficulty would be my way to oracle de dice, to find out if the water splashes the right way to notice something strange on the floor, like the door or the mechanism. If it doesn't make sense, then that's it, the secret door isn't found for now.<br/><br/>#4: "I twist the brazier upon its base." This would automatically succeed. Of course, this one is very, very rare. The key is to give the players clues that make them think. Hear them when they talk about their logic to other players. If it makes sense and it's interesting enough to make me change my prep, I'm all for it.<br/><br/>Yet I'd have to admit that it makes things just satisfactory, not ideal, and not exactly fair to be honest. I'm willing to hear about other approaches to this.<br/><br/><br/> </div>

Therein lies the problem. A man cannot serve two masters, or so I've read, but I nonetheless toil endlessly in a futile pursuit. From my perspective (within the context of challenge-oriented gameplay). the GM's role is to provide relevant information about the environment and it is the players' duty to engage with the environment to elucidate more information. This engagement creates immersion. As the players address and question the fiction, the GM is tasked with clarifying and expounding. This challenges both parties, as the GM's prep cannot account for the numerous fictional details that might exist.<br/><br/>Player engagement with the fiction serves as a cue for the GM in the same way that reading a sitch's questions serve as a cue: "Who's <i>really</i> in control here?" A prompt for information (and improvisation as needed), except rather than dealing with threat maps and hard moves, it's about hidden treasure and secret passageways.<br/><br/>Broadly:<br/><br/>If the players <i>properly</i> engage with the fiction, they deserve to be rewarded. If they're smart enough to twist the brazier, it is the GM's duty--and his delight--to give them the secret passageway or the hidden cache of gems. ("Properly" here being a matter of acumen.)<br/><br/>If the players engage with the fiction (deeply or shallowly), they deserve a chance at being rewarded. If they make an effort, they have earned a chance at finding the secret. "Deep" fictional engagement being the iconic prodding with a ten-foot pole, or in the case of the brazier, investigating it, dousing the flame, asking questions about its construction and design, etc. "Shallow" fictional engagement being a matter of minimal expenditure of mental effort.<br/><br/>If the players do not engage with the fiction, there should be a backup system in place to assist them. Some players cannot engage the fiction. They may be less intellectually curious, they may be unused to that style of play, they may be tired or mentally taxed, etc.  At the end of a long session, the GM is likewise taxed, and he may be unable to convey information properly. It would thus be unfair to provide all parties without a suitable recourse. (One does not hope to rely on a generator for power, but in the event of an outage, it is appreciated.)<br/><br/>Does what I am saying provide any clarity?<br/><br/>To answer your questions directly:
<blockquote>Is it to reward character builds/strengths?</blockquote>
Yes. A player who invests resources in finding hidden treasure should be superior in that regard to a player who invests resources elsewhere. ("Resources" being game mechanics.) 
<blockquote>Is it to challenge player cleverness?</blockquote>
I would phrase it as rewarding player cleverness, not necessarily challenging it.
<blockquote>Is it to enable detailed fictional exploration and puzzle/problem-solving?<br/></blockquote>
Yes.
<blockquote>Is it to maintain uncertainty about which secrets/clues are discovered by the players and which aren't?<br/></blockquote>
Yes. "Secrets/clues" being non-vital information.
<blockquote>Is it to make sure that necessary information gets to the players every time, but in a way which seems organic and fluid?</blockquote>
Yes. This is primarily a matter of GMing technique, but it also feeds into the first point: rewarding character strengths.                        </div>

                            Good answers! But many of them contradict each other - or, at least, potentially contradict each other. That's worth thinking about!<br/><br/>I don't think it's always possible to reward character design, player cleverness, and maintain uncertainty of which things are revealed, while ALSO making sure the information gets to the players in the end. Sometimes, maybe, but certainly not all the time.                        </div>

This is an honest question, do games that have clear goals and achieve them really lead to more enjoyment at the table? I think this is something we often just assume in game design but I don't know the it is always true. It definitely helps marketing to a niche. But when I look at the most successful games that the majority of people play, it seems like they are covering a very wide swath of territory, or at least not terribly focused on a tight set of goals or a single goal.                         </div>

                            That's a tremendously interesting question!<br/><br/>I'm going to start a new thread about it. See you there!<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21954/focused-design-and-play-is-it-worth-it" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21954/focused-design-and-play-is-it-worth-it</a>?<br/><br/>However, for the purposes of <i>this</i> thread, I'll mention that focused design as an approach to doing games (a larger topic, in other words) is potentially totally separate from the idea of having a clear intention at the table for how we're going to use a particular mechanic (more of an immediate, nuts-and-bolts concern).<br/><br/>For instance, we might say that <i>D&amp;D5E</i> is written to facilitate a variety of playstyles, sure, but it's important in <b><i>my</i></b> game that I establish that Perception rolls are used by us to make sure that we can represent the character's preternatural senses and intuition, which are part of the genre (highly perceptive, heroic adventurers!) and necessary to make up for all the sensory information the players aren't privy to.<br/><br/>This might be important if, for example, someone thinks that <i>D&amp;D</i> is great because they can change what XP means from game to game, getting a wider range of play with that game - that person might make the argument that they want their game <i>texts</i> somewhat open-ended but still prefer that their particular games or game sessions are defined and focused. (Although I don't know how common that attitude is!)                        </div>

                            In some ways, it seems to me that the question of what exactly can Perception perceive is similar to the question of what exactly can Seize by force seize.<br/><br/>You might roll Seize by force to seize the next hill, or you might roll to seize the Maginot Line, right?<br/><br/>The DM sets the stakes for any given roll (and it's often different kinds, scopes of stakes, roll by roll, not game by game), giving him an additional dial for difficulty and pacing, you roll Perception, and if you succeed you perceive whatever was at stake. In the same fictional situation, that might be "there's a secret door here activated by twisting the brazier" or "there's a secret door here" or "the brazier looks like it's been twisted before" or "you're sure there's more to this room than meets the eyes".<br/><br/>So typing this out, it occurs to me there's at least three layers of focus-vs.-openness: 1) how focused is the game in saying what Perception does; 2) within that, how focused is our consensus on what Perception does in our game; 3) within that, how focused is our understanding of what Perception does for this one roll.<br/><br/>I think there's a very good argument for vagueness in 1) and 2), but very little value (if any?) in vagueness in 3).                        </div>

                            Overjoyed that I've been referenced in so many threads, thank you so much DeReel♥<br/><br/>I love Critical Role for what it is. But it is so different from how we play.<br/><br/>My rule-of-thumb is that rolls are for physical actions. Hiding, lifting things, etc.<br/><br/>I straight up removed, without replacement, these seven skills: Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion, Insight, Investigation. Players know about this at char creation time so they can spend their resources elsewhere.<br/><br/>Perception and knowledge skills are most often used as passives.<br/><br/>Back in the day the example used in order to advocate for rolling behind the screen was "there is a cheetah in the tree. Do the heroes see it? If you roll openly and they fail, they'll know that they've missed <i>something</i>".<br/>Passive perception and passive skills solve this problem.<br/><br/>I let the players find things IOR they have high enough passive, or they "hit the right pixel".<br/>When I make my own dungeons I usually use jot down the DC by taking 15+4dF. I don't want there to always be a threshold of PP that's optimal to go for. Sometimes 14 is enough and sometimes you need 17.<br/><br/>Usually there are plenty of secrets that my players don't find and I'm OK with that. There are also things that passive perception (yet another reason to have a CoDzilla along) just "spoils" for them a la this:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><ul><li>You find the secret door to the treasure room! But you still need to get out of the dungeon alive.</li><li>You spot a giant pit trap in front of you. But you still must jump over it.</li><li>You spot a poison needle trap on that locked chest. But you still must unlock it and avoid getting pricked.</li><li>You notice someone tailing you. But you still must decide if letting them know you're onto them is a good idea, and possibly shake them or confront them.</li></ul></div></blockquote>
and that always works out great too. Traps are the most fun when all the elements are known but the players still fuck up or are tricked. Traps that are just "ok as you're walking down the corridor whoops you take 96000 damage each, gg" aren't great.<br/><br/>Also, they have "detect trap" spells and "wand of secrets" etc. They have plenty of rope to hang themselves with. Last sesh a "detect trap" spell misfired and they spent 20 minutes trying desperately to get three (actually non-existent) traps to trigger. They transformed themselves into boards to clamp around heavily on the floor, they were hitting the walls hard with staffs, they spider climbed in the ceiling. They were more afraid of <i>missing</i> the trap than the consequences. FOMO is a powerful drug♥                        </div>

                            I use active perception for 1 thing and that's when they <b>know</b> some monster has hidden in very abstracted scenery "uh the general bric-a-brac and undergrowth around here" and they're trying to hit it, I might have them roll active perc. Strictly as a combat mechanic thing, as the inverse of them making stealth rolls.<br/>And to determine if anybody is Surprised at start of fights.                        </div>

                            Oh, Seclusium was mentioned. Yeah, I've been influenced by those rules too♥<br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/446869/p1" rel="nofollow">This</a> came from there.<br/><br/>Instead of 2d6 vs 7-9/10+ I use normal d20 system rolls vs 12-19/20+ when I want ternary outcomes. Which I pretty much never do.<br/>There is sooo little rolling of that kind in our games.<br/>Instead I usually charge time.<br/> </div>
