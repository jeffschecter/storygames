Usually this leads to a lot of neat hack ideas that I never implement because a) I'm lazy and b) I'm convinced I don't have what it takes to do game design. This time is different, because I'm a) really excited and b) going to write this shit down.<br/><br/>So what I'm doing is hacking How We Came to Live Here, because I love that game and I think it's got a lot of great ideas. I want to make a Nordic version: How We Came to Pillage Here, or something equally clever and witty so everyone will love me and play my hack. The basic idea is to transplant the mechanics from HWCtLH wholesale into a Nordic themed game. Vikings, terrible gods, hostile environments, and traditions and obligations that weigh heavily on young heroes. If you'd like, you can read my initial pitch and follow the progress at <a href="http://twhunt.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">my new game design blog</a>. I would actually be really happy if people started reading and commenting on what I had to say; I think that would provide a lot of motivation to get more involved in the hobby.<br/><br/>If you don't want to read the ramblings of a semi-delusional dude, I completely understand, but if you're able and willing, well, I'd count you as a friend.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295693/#Comment_295693" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-02T04:19:20+00:00" title="October  2, 2010  4:19AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds awesome!

But gender roles are clearly defined and women in the sagas had a lot of power over their realm. Creating a transgressive sin list is easy. You've got the al\xfeing where rule-breakers can stand in judgment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295738/#Comment_295738" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-03T01:47:06+00:00" title="October  3, 2010  1:47AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brennen -- thanks for the support.
