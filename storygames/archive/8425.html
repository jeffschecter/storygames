I did a PDF a few years back called E6, which is 3.5e d20, using levels 1-6 to do epic stories.  This gave the world a very gamist/simulationist feel.  <br/><br/>The .pdf I did just explained the core rule change and its implications, so you'd still need a PHB or the SRD to play.  <br/><br/>I'm thinking about doing a complete E6 pdf, which would be likened to a Basic D&amp;D book.  No PHB or SRD would be required.<br/><br/><i>Here's where I run into the problems...</i><br/><br/>3.5e is showing its age; there are obvious things that can be improved, but everyone and their dog seems to have a different idea of how to solve them.  I do too.  I think E6 is a very strong game, and one of its strengths is that simplicity - it's exactly the D&amp;D 3.5e you know, to level 6, and then there's a feat-only progression.  I worry that if I start mucking around with the underlying 3.5e game, I'll end up with another "hey, start my learning curve."  <br/><br/>I'm wide open to advice.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186229/#Comment_186229" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T08:59:21+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  8:59AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan,<br/><br/>I think E6 hits an interesting niche. 4E is not universally loved, and it certainly isn't good at the exact same things that 3.5 was good at.<br/><br/>There are obvious things that could be improved in 3.5, but it's not a bad ruleset. Your other fixes (death flag, etc) have been pretty good, and there's some simplification that can be done in certain areas, like grappling.<br/><br/>My advice would be to take the d20 SRD, slice out everything above 6th level (note: I'd leave monsters up to DC 10 or 12 to emulate terrifying creatures that challenge even the toughest heroes), add your other fixes, and simplify where possible.<br/><br/>I moved from 3.5 to 4 when it came out, and I like 4, but there's a charm to 3.5 that definitely isn't in 4.

I have also figured out my own solution, let's see if it works for you:<br/>\n<br/>\nRecognize what parts of your variant game are actually pertinent to the play experience and write about those. Don't try to write a full system, don't try to fix the details to match your variant perfectly. The audience interested in your variant is already proficient in the base system and fully capable of applying your ideas for themselves, combining them with whatever flavor of house rules they use.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, E6 is something I'm perfectly capable of running myself without you ever writing a formal list of acceptable feats and how to change things around. I don't need you to figure out how to change the Monk class for me - if I'm both committed enough to the D&amp;D; rules set and proficient enough to demand improvements (both requirements for me to be interested in E6, note), then I'm also easily skilled enough to just listen to your instructions and apply them myself. Write in general terms and don't worry about the details.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if you want to make a stand-alone game, then deal with it that way and don't worry about backwards compatibility. That way lies madness, you have to accept that either a reader is capable of learning your new/recycled rules system or not. And if he's not, then no amount of second-guessing and cleaving to the D&amp;D; rules will help him integrate your new ideas; he will rather play D&amp;D; than your new, incompatible game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general you can't have your cake and eat it too when it comes to game design. Commit to a singular vision confidently and create the best product you can on that basis rather than trying to second-guess yourself with alternative concepts that are not compatible. You can't at the same time fix D&amp;D; and make an independent game, so make up your mind over which it is you're doing and work on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record, I'd find a cleaned-up E6 pretty cool if it were completely thought out as an independent game without particular effort at staying true to the D&amp;D; system. But then, I'm certainly not in the original target audience in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186773/#Comment_186773" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T06:44:51+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  6:44AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>if it were completely thought out as an independent game without particular effort at staying true to the D&amp;D system.</blockquote>This is the thing; if I took every little 'improvement' I made to 3.5e, the result looks more like Red Box Hack than like a d20 game.  In fact, it doesn't even use standard dice (d6es numbered 0-5, for god's sake).  I think that hyper-improved game is a good game, but it's not a stable ruleset yet, and playtesting isn't likely for a couple of years (long commutes, no car).  E6 by way of 3.5e is at least a good stepping stone in the conversation I'd like to have with d20 gamers, but is that enough to justify its existence?

At the same time I have my hands full with other things and my project is still far from complete.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy approach to this situation is that I'm specifically not gearing up to productizing my angle of attack in the foreseeable future. You can read my blog, it documents how I circle the topic and strike it from different directions. But it's all just musing, notes, short articles and other free stuff that is not intended as a finished product. This is because I have no interest in producing a product before my process, including theory, playtest, game design and more playtest is finished. Doing a product before then seems indefensible and unnecessary, I'm in no hurry to get my thing finished before it's ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom this viewpoint I suggest that if your reason for productizing E6 is simply that you don't have the time to make the real game you're going towards, then productizing E6 is probably a mistake. Some processes are massive and interesting enough to justify snapshots, but roleplaying game design in general is not. We want the stable thing that is at the end of your journey, not something you yourself know is just a compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I just published a game book last year with the concept of "this is how Eero plays Solar System right now", so I'm also of the mind that texts displaying real praxis are an interesting and viable thing. I'm just not sure if E6 is that text - it seems to me that you're artificially holding back there, which is no good; the reason for why I can agree to sell my "Solar System 2008" booklet is that it's current, it's practical and it doesn't pretend to be a finished product in the traditional sense of plateauing game design. Is this the case with E6 as well, or is it just a hollow shell of a process that left it behind some time back?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186827/#Comment_186827" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T10:08:46+00:00" title="January  8, 2009 10:08AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could wait for Pathfinder and then put out a set of E6 patches for that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187004/#Comment_187004" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T17:53:38+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  5:53PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>It depends, Ryan. You're thinking of<i>selling</i>a PDF, right?</blockquote>E6 is a stable ruleset that's playtested and works.  I could release a 3.5 E6 PDF, buy art, and charge for it based on how much time it would take me to do the development, plus any art costs and layout work.  I could feel good about charging for that game because I know the experience it delivers.  But I'd take it a lot further from its d20 roots at my own table.<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi-Who-Babbles.</cite>Is it a game people will enjoy playing?  Yes?  Then, no reason not to, unless you're more concerned with the art of your vision than with the craft of designing for others.</blockquote>That hit it on the head.  A complete E6 would definitely be a design others can enjoy, and I think they could enjoy it more than existing d20 with its distracting, level 7+ bling.<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Is [...] E6 [...] just a hollow shell of a process that left it behind some time back?</blockquote>No, it's definitely a plateau, with lots of fun that can be had on that plateau.<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>You could wait for Pathfinder and then put out a set of E6 patches for that.</blockquote>Very, very tempting; that would be ceding Pathfinder the "3.75e" space it craves.  I will have to look at their OGL declaration carefully.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187006/#Comment_187006" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T18:05:21+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  6:05PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>A complete E6 would definitely be a design others can enjoy, and I think they could enjoy it more than existing d20 with its distracting, level 7+ bling.</blockquote>\nLike... yeah. Definitely. Unlike Eero, some of us could use some hints about suitable feats (no, I wouldn't mind a loooooong list) and you must've already heard the "Why not 8/10/12" thing to death).<br><br>After finally taking a look at what E6 was (hadn't reached me before) I got pretty excited at what I saw. I think there's definitely a lot of charm in it and it got me wanting to pull out the 3.5 books. That doens't happen very often so you've definitley got a good thing here.<br><br>Art by Storn and more implied setting!                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
