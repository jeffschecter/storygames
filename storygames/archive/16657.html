I love many aspects from non-traditional games, but tend to lean more to the standard approach with a strong GM. Over the Edge and Risus are near the top, but AW, BoL, Danger Patrol, IAWA, Lady Blackbird and others have all made impacts. The goal I've set out for myself is to use a system that is fun, fast and can blend into the background (and hack to various settings). I really want to focus more on the \u2018how and why\u2019 in which actions are performed, rather than on the core attributes that allow you to accomplish them. But at the same time it is difficult trying to find a balance between accurate portrayals and actually playing them.<br/><br/>So I'm running the design through the hoops to see how it will look.<br/><br/>Here is a link to a tear sheet: <br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img18.imageshack.us/img18/7043/4x4z.jpg"/><br/><br/>Here, I'm trying to see how it would look for old school D&amp;D type game, but can adapt for other genres. <br/><br/>------<br/>When confronted with an obstacle you need to roll the dice. <br/><br/>If your TRADE can be used for the action, then you get 1D. If not, the THREAT score goes up by 1.<br/><br/>If you have any TOOLS you can use, then you get 1D. If not, the THREAT score goes up by 1.<br/><br/>You get 1B for each temperament you can use. However, you cannot roll more than six dice. If you have a condition, then the bonus die becomes 1P.<br/><br/>TRUMPS allow for dice to be rerolled and other benefits, while TROUBLES can take away dice or outcomes.<br/>------<br/><br/>I'm still not sure if I like the way Trumps and Troubles work and want to clean these up.<br/><br/>There four conditions: Doubt, Hurt, Regret, and Spent. In combat, one or more of these can be affected. If you are wounded bad enough you are considered hurt. This changes a bonus die to a penalty die. You can remove the condition by either making it a trouble (troubles remove dice from the pool) or by spending one of your Threat points. Threat points tell you how badass you are and also provide your defense score, so burning one can be dangerous (they can refresh later).<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381048/#Comment_381048" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-06T13:52:53+00:00" title="June  6, 2012  1:52PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From what you have shown so far, it feels like another version of similar games.
