<p>So, brief summary of my take on Push/Pull:  It is defined in large part by what people choose to see as important.  Everything is (on some level) an assertion of authority, so a Push is not just that, it is an assertion of authority where the assertion is viewed as important.  Likewise, a Pull is a solicitation of input where the input is viewed as important.</p>
<p>To my mind a fair rule of thumb is that Push happens when you view your own input as important and Pull happens when you view other people's input as important.</p>
<p>Now, combine with what we know (from game design) about reward systems:  Reward systems can radically change what people focus their attention on.  They can change what they consider important.</p>
<p>These two seem (to me) to be a very fruitful area for discussion.  My theory is that rewards given to a player for what <em>they</em> do will promote recognition of Push, and rewards given to a player player for what <em>other people</em> do will promote recognition of Pull.</p>
<p>For instance, players in Burning Wheel are rewarded for hitting their own Beliefs.</p>
<p>By comparison, players in Primetime Adventures are rewarded when other players enjoy their narrations.</p>
<p>Does this seem to hold up with the intuitive sense that people have about Push/Pull?  Do these rewards, for instance, seem to correlate with the sort of social dynamics that people associate with the two terms?</p>

                            Tony, <br/><br/>Sounds pretty close to me. <br/><br/>Same deal with Breaking the Ice, where you get rewarded for doing something that pleases the other person, and/or have the ability to reward someone for pleasing you. What you do is much less important than how the other person feels about what you did, so you start focusing on how what you do makes the game more like what they want it to be. <br/><br/>OTOH, in Nine Worlds you get rewarded when you win a conflict and get your way (points, which winner gets to take and narration which goes to winner). So, IME at least, you start looking for ways to drive the game towards things you can do to win and make the story cool. <br/><br/>Am I making sense on your end of the tin cans and string?                        </div>

<p>Yep.  I don't know Nine Worlds well enough to comment, but Breaking the Ice is definitely one I was already thinking of.</p>
<p>GM games where GM judgment dispenses serious player rewards is another sub-type of this that ... y'know what, separate thread.  The moment I thought about that one, I realized that needed a separate thread.</p>

By my lights, Capes has some king-hell push/pull stuff.  I make conflicts, and try to make them ones you want in on, and that's where the reward is?<br/>

<p>Oh, I was mostly just realizing that in a lot of games there are tons of rewards that are given to players only when the GM chooses to give them out.  I was thinking particularly of RP bonusses in Sorceror, but the pattern is rife throughout RPGs.</p>
<p>That encourages people to see the GMs input as more important than player input, even if they are (otherwise) given similar amounts of power to impact the fiction.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I find it fascinating that My Life with Master is geared very explicitly to have <em>zero</em> rewards that the Master can offer to the players.</p>
<p>Yes, the Master is the focal point of the story, but what the Master does isn't actually anything that the players are rewarded for paying attention to.</p>

                            Tony, <br/><br/>What about Intimacy/Desperation/Sincerity? Doesn't the GM decide who gets those dice, based on interpretations of actions? (I don't remember, and my book is hiding from me at this moment.) <br/><br/>Though, that doesn't really change your point -- the thing about it is that all the GM can do to reward you is give you better dice for doing whatever you can to get out from under the control of the Master. He can reward you for sucking up to him, but you get better rewards only for trying to subvert him. <br/><br/>Which is quite interesting, if you read MLwM as being about breaking dysfunctional relationships and RPG habits....                        </div>

<p>It's one of those wierd cases where the rules say "GM discretion" but then the guidelines clearly state "If they ask for it, give it to them" (well, literally "If a player makes an honest attempt, give up the goods")</p>
<p>Still, you're right, not as clear-cut a case as I thought it was.</p>

<p>Well, certainly that's my take on it, yeah.</p>
<p>I am <em>very</em> interested in the way that rewards can draw people not only to do <em>a thing</em> ("If you use a longsword and you're an elf you get +1 to attack") but a whole sequence of things ("If you use stealth then you can flank your opponents, and if you're already flanking your opponents then you can take an attack of opportunity, and if you take ten attacks of opportunity then you charge your Ring of Thiefiness, and if your Ring of Thiefiness is charged then you can use it to walk through walls").  Under that sort of schema, you do things not directly for the reward, but (game-theory-wise) to establish a condition ("flanking") that gets you closer to an end-state in which you can receive the reward.</p>
<p>This gets really interesting when the sequence is made up <em>both</em> of things that you do and things that other players do.  A single reward can lead you to assign importance both to your own actions and to the actions of others, in an interweaving that (I think) draws Push and Pull very closely together.  And, incidentally, I think it's fun and functional.</p>
