                    This has been niggling at me for a bit since I've consciously moved away from viewing a dice roll as a measure of mere competence and folded into it circumstance and good fortune. A failure need not represent an individual's inability, but rather a heretofore unknown circumstance that arises. Failed to sneak by the guard? It turns out he was only pretending to be asleep to lure you into a false sense of security! Failed to convince the noble to pay you a bit more for that dragon-slaying job? His reserves of gold are low because the dragon's been eating his tax collectors!<br/><br/>This is rather rudimentary to most of the SG community, I'm sure.<br/><br/>Further meditations on the nature of the dice roll have impressed to me other, more abstract interpretations of the dice. The dice are little oracles that are cast to foretell the truth of an undertaking. Someone proposes something to be true, and there is uncertainty. The dice are thrown and the rules consulted, as if casting a handful of sticks and consulting the <i>I Ching</i>. Or, more crudely, you say what you want to be true and shake the Magic 8-Ball to see what it thinks of the matter.<br/><br/>It always comes back to the reaction roll for me. 2d6 with three outcomes (initially): negative, neutral, positive. The striking similarity to PbtA mechanics is noted, but it does something that PbtA does not: it demands players and GM relinquish their power and rely entirely on the dice. Except there's one caveat: the Charisma bonus. Charisma bonus applies to the roll, meaning that charismatic characters are more likely to encounter hospitable monsters. The reaction roll determines an encounter, but the PC's abilities influence the reaction roll--and thus place a finger on the scales of the fictional universe.<br/><br/>Applying this mechanic more broadly, one could easily generate three outcomes for any die roll: yes, no, maybe. The player proposes something to be true, and the dice are cast alongside the appropriate ability, and the truth of that matter is determined by the dice roll...which of course represents circumstance, fortune, and skill. And a PC being particularly skilled at something (<i>having a high modifier</i> in the D&amp;D parlance) allows them to influence the universe, gently nudging it to make circumstance and fortune agree with his desires.<br/><br/>In practice:<br/><br/>Yes, no, maybe only works some of the time for some of the questions. A "maybe" is not a very compelling answer. Naturally, in the age of PbtA, the "maybe" becomes "yes, but not exactly," or "not quite what you wanted, but not quite what you didn't want."<br/><br/>I'm going on at length, but certain mechanical extrapolations of this are coming to me as I type.<br/><br/>PLAYER: "I kill the orc."<br/>DM: "Do you? Roll the dice."<br/><br/>Yes, the orc is dead. No, the orc is not dead (and he's mad). Maybe he's not dead but he's wounded.<br/><br/>That's the most obvious application within the most beloved murderhobo simulator, but what about something different.<br/><br/>PLAYER: "The orcs are asleep."<br/>DM: "They might be. Roll the dice."<br/><br/>Yes, the orcs are asleep, or no, they're not. Or maybe most of them are asleep, but there's a lone sentry who is awake, or perhaps they're all dozing.<br/><br/>Extrapolating further: touching on Fate's mechanics. The above exchange would be likely a Create An Advantage roll. Oh, yeah, the orcs are asleep, so you get a free +2 to whatever you're trying to do. This yes/no/maybe-kinda-sorta roll could very well work within a similar context.<br/><br/>Are the orcs asleep? Roll a d20 and add to it whatever. On a yes, they're asleep, which gives you an advantage. On a no, they're not asleep, and in fact are alert, which gives you a disadvantage. On a maybe, some are asleep and some are alert, which opens an opportunity for you: you have a strong advantage against some and a disadvantage against others. How can you make use of this? Apply dice bonuses and penalties as you see fit.<br/><br/>Pushing this idea further, what if the die roll set the entire scene, and players could then influence the roll with their own rolls to make it more favorable (or unfavorable)? Roll the "reaction roll" for the orcs. Oh, well, it would seem that the circumstances are against you, initially. But you can try to improve them. A Charisma roll might allow you to propose something like, "These orcs are well-fed, and their bloodlust is sated" (you're influencing their mood, so it's Charisma for the purposes of this example). A roll of yes/no/maybe-kinda-sorta determines this, and if the answer is no, we treat it as a 6- (escalation).<br/><br/>Forgive my long-winded rambling on this matter, but as a final note, I've already begun experimenting with this in my 5e game. Instead of reaction rolls, I have whomever is leading the party roll his Persuasion check to determine a monster's reaction. It has worked well thus far. Recently, I had a player ransack a weapons locker and say he wanted to find a magic item. Was there a magic item stowed away there? Oh, it was certainly a possibility given the circumstances. I hadn't planned it, but I allowed him to declare what he wanted to find and roll Investigate to discover a minor magical sword. (Why not?)<br/><br/> </div>

                            This feels a bit like some of the advice in Trollbabe - where the conflict/roll to determine if they can spot anyone sneaking in the woods defines whether or not there is someone sneaking in the woods.                        </div>

                            Here, the roll gives you an information poor, abstract answer. Which is nice : the bit is very malleable. The limit is the number of rolls. BTW : charisma in reaction roll or AW stats in moves have very much the same role.<br/><br/>Tarot cards can give you rich abstract answers. Random tables can give you rich concrete answers. You may know Aces of Aces which was all rather poor concrete answers. It really depends on what you need the Oracle for. I need rich concrete answers to unburden player creativity, like : pick a random picture on the Web.<br/><br/>Such "monotonous" inputs don't make a game but are easy to slap on anything as a complement for what they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don't</span> do.                        </div>

                            I like your breakdown into circumstance, fortune, and skill. I'd maybe say those are all the modifiers, too. If circumstances matter, that's a modifier, sometimes affected by player skill. If fortune matters, and it always does, that's a modifier (the dice), and in rare cases like "blessing of the gods", might be a + or - too. And of course if skill matters, that's a modifier.<br/><br/>So then, is there a magic item? Circumstance might matter. Fortune matters. Character skill doesn't really, unless it's generally quite hard to identify that an item is magical, in which case probably circumstance is a negative modifier...?                        </div>

                            As you're already in "non-character player resource" territory, you can as well make it a "Magic-wise" roll to determine if it's a magic item : "spout Lore" from On mighty thews.

I'm specifically running D&amp;D 5e. I don't mind interference because I'm always picking apart little bits and pieces of games to use elsewhere. Talk about whatever games you want that have similar mechanics or ideas.

I understand half of the reference there, though I probably would not allow it to be a magic item straight off the bat. I enjoy setting up quests for things like that! "Ah, as you examine the item, you notice it has some small, glittering runes etched into the blade. It certainly appears to be enchanted in some way, but you'll need to visit the Wise Old Questgiver for more information..."                        </div>

                            With the reaction roll, you're making a skill to let the player influence the setting. It's not longer a character resource, it's a player resource. <br/>I think Dungeon World has the Spout Lore skill. It's "Lore" in On mighty thews, a game that does precisely this, superbly.                        </div>

                            I kinda hate what "my stat determines whether other creatures have eaten or slept" does to fictional causality.  If you don't mind that, though, I think you have a lot of great options!  Why <i>not</i> let rolls and character stats determine every relevant situational modifier?  Rather than inventing answers to all of these questions, the GM can merely color them.  Sounds fun to me!<br/><br/>I would be careful about letting participants propose whatever they want, though.  "The orcs are asleep" might or might not be too big a deal to just say, "Roll pretty well and you get what you want."  You'll need to figure out where to draw that line.  Maybe some advice or principles for the GM would suffice.  "Encourage players to propose advantages and roll, except when..."                        </div>

                            I thought about a thing when I dissected what a dice roll could mean, and I started with a situation where the characters wants to lift a stone. It's pretty simple, where a character is either able to lift the stone or can't lift the stone, but also where weaker characters shouldn't be able to lift the stone if a stronger character can't.<br/><br/>So a die roll can't be applicable to that kind of situation, and instead the game master (or adventure creator) should determine a minimum value (a <i>difficulty</i>) to be able to lift the stone. So why not extend this, and let Sneak rolls be at a certain difficulty instead? Because either they can sneak past the guard, or they can't.<br/><br/>So what makes the die roll even mean, if it can be replaced by the game master to just make up values that a skill of the whole party need to match up to?<br/><br/>That's when I started to game master differently, where I made up explanations why a roll didn't succeed, or the players made up why a skill roll succeeded. Perhaps there were wines that helped the character climb a wall, or there were security guards noticing the character when they passed the wall? Because the roll is just a difficulty made up for the whole party, which – in a way – means that rolling separate rolls for each character is just defeating the "purpose" of the roll: to determine how hard the situation really is.                        </div>

                            This reminds me a lot of like a burning wheel wises. You can use wises in that game to establish particular truths. It's often not used that way, but there's nothing stopping you from making fictional setting truths into contests in BW. I'm pretty sure Luke Crane played a whole campaign based on a successful legends-wise. <br/><br/>I bring it up because it's another way on playing to find out if something is true or not based on dice, but it all goes back to the player character rather than just something like a Die of Fate/Fortune Roll. <br/><br/> </div>

                            There are lots of things to explore here. <br/><br/>One implementation I've come up with is the "Dice of Fate", which I use in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17652/apocalypse-world-for-kids-the-bureau-an-aw-hack-with-different-die-types" rel="nofollow">my game <i>The Bureau</i></a>:<br/><br/>First, I consider what might be the most typical, expected, or unremarkable outcome or situation.<br/><br/>Then, I roll two Fudge dice (six-sided dice marked with [0], [-], and [+]).<br/><br/>This gives me two details, or two things to say.<br/><br/>For each [0], I say something that it typical, expected, or unremarkable.<br/><br/>For each [-], I say something that's bad news or bad luck.<br/><br/>For each [+], I say something that's good news or a happy coincidence.<br/><br/>If there's a [+] and a [-], connect them with a "but".<br/><br/>Generally, the first detail or statement should answer the concrete question, if there is one.<br/><br/>e.g. "We go find a a political ally among the Priestesses. Is she willing to help us?"<br/><br/>Perhaps I decide that, by default, the Priestesses are skeptical but could be bought with money, power, or favours, or won over with strong emotional appeals.<br/><br/>I roll:<br/><br/>[0], [+]<br/><br/>The first die tells me that is she skeptical but could be won over - no surprises here.<br/><br/>But the second die tells me there is some good news, as well: perhaps she holds a grudge against our enemies, and that might mean something going forward.<br/><br/>I'm also quite fond of the diceless "oracle" I used in my game "As the Worm Turns", which accomplishes this quite well without any random elements (but requires three players):<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19960/as-the-worm-turns-live-open-playtest-formerly-backseat-adventures/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19960/as-the-worm-turns-live-open-playtest-formerly-backseat-adventures/p1</a> </div>

                            There's also an old game (or game aid, perhaps) that's entirely about this, called "Mythic". I don't have much experience with this, but I know it has its fans.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.wordmillgames.com/mythic-game-master-emulator.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wordmillgames.com/mythic-game-master-emulator.html</a><br/><br/>It's all about "dice rolls represent truth", as a way of Exploring the fictional space. I guess whoever came up with it decided that, with enough of these dice rolls, you no longer need a GM! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Yes, MGME is a wonderful, if a bit overbuilt, item.<br/><br/>It could do with a bit of simplification, but if you cut your teeth on the old TSR Marvel Superheroes (FASERIP) universal chart, the core resolution chart in MGME will seem very familiar.<br/><br/>That, combined with some of the other random generation subsystems, does wonders for pick up and play adventure building on the fly.                        </div>

                            What catches my eye here is not about the fortune/circumstance/whatever roll so much as the agreements that are required to reach the roll. Before you can even get to "the orcs are asleep," you need there to <i>be orcs in the first place</i>. What's the scenario that caused you to encounter orcs and for their wakefulness to matter? And, this might sound silly, but is crucial: why didn't the fortune roll determine all of that, too? Or, hell, <b>did</b> it?<br/><br/>If you can use a roll to locally determine that specific orcs are asleep, can there be a roll that determines whether or not ANY orcs EVER sleep? You're playing with a lot of pre-determined fiction, so how does that differ from the fiction you agree should be up to the roll of the dice?<br/><br/>Those might sound like rhetorical questions, but they aren't. The answers are going to vary by player and game - sometimes subtly, sometimes blatantly. But I suspect the system relevance and power of such rolls will be clarified by those answers.                        </div>
