[1]<br/><br/>* In a given situation, you roll a number of Roshambo dice equal to the MO that you are using [2] and then apportion results:<br/>-- For each die result that would beat the MO in use in Roshambo <span style="color: #0000FF;">(Failure dice)</span>, you pass the die (and its result) to another player. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">[3]</span><br/>-- For each die result that matches the MO in use <span style="color: #0000FF;">(Success dice)</span>, you may roll another, bonus die.

Repeat the above die apportioning steps for THIS new character in the scene. <b>Note:</b> Each MO may only be invoked--by ANY character--only once per scene; so if you started with Resolve, the next player may only introduce him- or herself and state goals using Manipulation or Flexibility (and the following player in the scene may only invoke the remaining MO).

I think this could be a fun way to complexify something like Pass the Stick. The most-obvious issues are noted in the Footnotes, but I welcome further ideas or any problems that you notice off the bat. Single-sided stakes are a possible problem (only the current spolight player really has stakes; everyone else just tries to thwart, if given a die). Maybe it needs to get away from the My Guy approach, taking on more of a "single PC game" notion or a "shared PCs game" like Universalis?<br/><br/>Anyhow...

I roll 3 dice.  They come up (lets say) 1 Paper, 1 Rock, 1 Scissor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe paper I give to you to use against me.  The Rock and Scissor I keep.  The Rock gives me a bonus die which comes up paper and so is discarded.<br/>\n<br/>\nI narrate using (say) my rock die incorporating how I've steeled my will and am bound and determined to do a Thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou then narrate using the paper die incorporating how my inflexibility has left me fruitlessly banging my head into a wall and failing to do the Thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then narrate using my remaining scissor die incorporating how I manipulate the situation to remove the obstacle that was in my way, allowing me to do the Thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince mine was the last die spent, I do the thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf so, the immediate thing that stepped out to me is that statistically I'll expect to have 2 dice to do my thing vs 1 die to oppose (cuz I got to keep my Rock and my Scissors) and only gave away paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe alternative I'd suggest is to give away the odd die as well (Scissors in this example), with the player receiving that die able to narrate either for or against me at their choice.  That way the end result is actually determined by how the players at the table choose to use their Scissor dice.  For clarity, as it came to each scissor player I'd probably make them change their die to either Rock or Paper to signify what side they were coming down on, possibly giving them the option to pass or discard their die...maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo ramp things up a notch, you could give players who recieved a die the option to spend that die to introduce their own character into the scene...give a goal...make a new roll...and distribute the dice from that roll as well, then narrate your way through two conflicts at once.  It might be interesting to allow the dice to be used for either conflict.  For instance if the other player's action was scissors opposed by rock...paper would be the odd die out.  You could use your paper to either oppose my rock, or as a free vote either way for the other conflict.  The player I gave my scissor to could use the scissor as a free vote either way in my conflict, or to support the other conflict (being a scissor conflict).  I could use my rock to support my conflict or oppose the scissor conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact...if the other player with the scissor conflict rolled some rocks, they might well be tempted to give them to me figuring I'd use them to help myself rather than opposing them...which would open up some neat meta opportunities...say if that player knew that I'd want to stop what they were doing and picked a scissor conflict on purpose knowing I'd be reluctant to burn my rocks to stop them                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178557/#Comment_178557" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-13T12:14:34+00:00" title="November 13, 2008 12:14PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Yes?</blockquote>Yep...

Err, hmm... but say they narrate themselves in, roll three dice, same even spread--they state another narrative fact (in favor of their goal), pass of a Complication (failure die), and pass off a neutral... possibly to ME.

It would play way different if I rolled 9 dice than just the 3 in my example...can't really visualize whether "different" = better / worse / or just different...<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm envisioning the game with a bunch of props...like a folded piece of paper for paper, a rock for rock, and a pair of scissors for (wait for it...) scissors.  When you start a conflict you put that prop in front of you so everyone knows what you're going for.  Then when you narrate your first die you put that die specifically in front of your prop...its your success level.  When other people support you they give you that die (in front of the prop...not behind with the rest of your yet-to-be-used dice).  When people oppose you they discard their die and one of yours, so that the number of dice in front of the prop is always the "success" of that action.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has the side effect of making 0 the minimum success (i.e. failure), so if it was desireable to have degrees of failure to one could have little piles of rocks and paper in front of the prop instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would also work with Fudge Dice, simply by redefining the symbols.  + could be scissors (cuz it looks like an open scissors), blank could be paper like a blank page, and - could be rock...cuz its just a lump.  That would preclude the need for special dice for folks who already have plenty o'Fudge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178565/#Comment_178565" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-13T12:41:05+00:00" title="November 13, 2008 12:41PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, edits made... and I realized something.<br><br>Your OWN dice narration will always be in a Success MO.

If mine is the only conflict, then yes I only narrate in my declared MO.  But if I gave you a scissors and you chose to narrate it in my favor (a good chance if I picked you to receive it wisely)...you'd still narrate it as a scissors so there are still two ways to narrate past a Complication...its just someone else would be coming up with the narration.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you used a die to start your own conflict, and made it say...paper...then you'd have to give away your scissors and your rocks.  You might well give your scissors to me trusting that I'd use them to add to my own success rather than oppose you, and thus there's still a way for the same player to narrate rocks and scissors to their own benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you made a rule that there could be no more than 1 Conflict of each type active at a time (probably a good rule) then eventually no additional Conflicts could be started and there'd likely be enough dice flying around to be interesting.  Say that was the case and I had a bunch of rocks.  I could use the Rock to narrate my own success.  But if I was already winning by a comfortable lead (or found I cared about the other conflicts more) I could use the Rock to oppose Mr. Scissors or to help or hinder Mr. Paper.  So with 3 Conflicts going at once I'd have 4 choices to make for each die I had been given.  That seems like a goodly bit of variety to keep things mixed up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might also want to consider not tying the trait to the number of dice rolled.  Maybe you always roll 5 dice and the trait score does something else entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be a pool of automatic successes that you can spend...with some sort of refresh mechanic (either per session or ala Shadow of Yesterday).  Or instead of automatic successes...rerolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be the number of dice you keep instead of the automatic rules above.  If you have a low Trait you might be forced to give away your success dice to someone else...who may use them to your benefit or throw them away.  If you have a high Trait you may be able to keep some of the neutrals to use yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr a bunch of other things.  I'm thinking it might go smoother if the Trait didn't tie directly to the number of dice rolled...which if it didn't, you could get rid of the Bonus Dice rule altogether (as that rule is only necessary to ensure that more dice = better).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178680/#Comment_178680" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-14T08:15:34+00:00" title="November 14, 2008  8:15AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Again, thanks for all the ideation, Ralph!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>you'd still narrate it as a scissors</blockquote>Ah, didn't catch that--amending first post again.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>So with 3 Conflicts going at once I'd have 4 choices to make for each die I had been given.

I got dice changing hands, folks considering the backrub/stab balance... and over here we got auto-successes to really put a wrench int he works, when it comes to deciding how to invest a relatively small number of passed dice.<br><br>Of course, thematically, I like the idea of something wearing down one's resolve, making one less flexible, whittling away at one's cleverness. I could definitely see the stats going down due to failure (and maybe up, with success--but both make spirals, vicious and virtuous respectively). But perhaps that could be a stake in a scene: meeting with an inspiration to recover resolve, a mentor to recover flexibility, a ego-booster to rebuild manipulation. That sort of thing. And, yep, then folks come in and fuck with you. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>It could be the number of dice you keep instead of the automatic rules above.

So if I always roll 5 dice, then the max X is (perforce) 5, giving us a reasonable Y of about 8 or 9. Hmmm... yeah, that's worth some thought (won't add to above yet). Rolling 5 dice always also should help to mitigate ties (ex: I have a 4 Resolve, I roll 2 Rocks and 2 Papers--I'm a loser guaranteed).<br><br>Hmmm... but ties WILL make for some whiff factor. I MUST roll one extra Success (or a Neutral that I know will go to an ally) to succeed overall in the scene (i.e. get stakes). And that makes your idea of auto-successes more palatable, as it turns out--each character has a means of "pushing" for a stakes they REALLY want (assuming other PCs can't burn their stats for auto-failures). <br><br>Hey! Why not BOTH peanut butter and chocolate--the stat limits the number of dice I may keep out of the five I roll every time... and I can reduce a relevant stat by one to get another Success narration. Yeah, I like. THAT combo of rules makes for a "sink" on someone who is a one-trick pony: if I keep using my 5 Resolve, but get hit on Failures, it will soon NOT be my best stat, as I spend it down on autos.<br><br>OK, does that then mean we ought to allow for higher than 5 in a stat, or would the 5-cap encourage less one-trick poniness? But there's a balance here, too--we don't want a bunch of jack of all trades, either. The stats SHOULD, ideally, help to distinguish the PCs, if only by virtue of how they tend to face opposition.<br><br>That said, I am thinking a GM is now necessary--someone to aggressively frame opposition and establish situations of conflict. Otherwise, we could end up with three or four unconnected stories, generally mucking with each other (or helping each other breeze by). Also, SOMETHING is need to "aim" folks at each other--something like IAWA Best Interests, but with mechanical bite. <br><br>Damn... are we just reinventing IAWA with different Forms and dice mechanics? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>Or a bunch of other things.  I'm thinking it might go smoother if the Trait didn't tie directly to the number of dice rolled...which if it didn't, you could get rid of the Bonus Dice rule altogether (as that rule is only necessary to ensure that more dice = better).</blockquote>\nYeah, I'm with you on disconnecting... but not on removing the bonus die. Suppose we make it so that the bonus die roll is elective (as it is now) BUT it is played as any other die, if the actor chooses to roll it. Then, it becomes a risk/reward balance. If I've rolled all Successes, I won't roll any bonus dice. If I rolled only one Success and a stack of failure, I'll likely roll it in the hopes of better luck. And in the middle cases... man, the decision could be very tough, factoring in remaining Autos from stat values, likelihood of allies getting a Neutral and narrating a Success for me, etc.<br><br>Keep the wheels churning! I've been updating the main post each time, but after this (given how ideas are sort of exploding), I think I'll just do "interstitial" posts to summarize rule adoptions as they get some traction (i.e. when they seem to click, with little follow-on discussion).

That way you're always giving away at least 2 of the dice and the cycle of involving other players will be maintained.  I'm undecided whether you should have the ability to keep any 3 dice you want, or whether it should be a hierarchy (keep successes first, then neutrals, then opposed).  I can argue pros and cons to both ways...probably need playtesting to see what feels better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't immediately see a problem with 4 unconnected stories as the dice shareing will ensure involvment of all players and the simultaneous nature of conflicts involving different players would be similar to the "Flashpoint" method used in Spione and some Sorcerer play which works pretty well.  I could see a GM...of the sort featured in IAWA or PTA, but it might take some thought to integrate such a position into the mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm, off the cuff brainstormy idea here:  Mechanically, the GM occupies a spot in the "round the table" narration but you never give the GM any of the dice you roll.  The GM can always roll their 5 dice on their turn (not needing to discard a die to do so) but can only declare a conflict of their own if one of the 3 Conflicts is still available.  If the GM does not or cannot declare a Conflict, but rolls their dice anyway, they must give them all away.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the GM declares a Conflict its not for anything related to the current scene...opposition to the current scene is all handled with how opposing dice are narrated...which the GM can influence by how they give away their dice.  Instead the GMs Conflict is tied to something off camera...the next stage in the Master Villain's Plan or the like.  Players whose characters may be in a position to help thwart that plan can spend their dice to oppose the GM as normal, or opposition dice can just represent other sources of opposition (like the cops or whatever makes sense).  If the GM wins the Conflict the villain moves one step closer to completeing their plan.  Mechanically the Master Plan is its own character with 3 Traits starting at 1.  Each time the Master Plan wins a Conflict, one of its Traits (probably one other than the one used sounds right) goes up by 1.  When the Traits all hit 3 (after winning 6 Conflicts) the plan comes to fruition.<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise the GM does some scene framing looking for opportunities to give players the opportunity to start conflicts so they can roll for the Plan as well.  This "Master Plan" idea would work well for anything from James Bond to With Great Power style supers, to most thrillers...even some horror...anything where the "bad guy" can "win" if someone doesn't "stop them".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179299/#Comment_179299" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-19T08:18:16+00:00" title="November 19, 2008  8:18AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I'm thinking hard... and sort of getting lost.

If that person narrates his or her Neutral die as a way to bypass the Complication, you are still succeeding in the conflict (getting your stake).

OK, I come into the kitchen and fix Mom with a mournful look, saying simply, "Mama, if you wanted me to be happy--TRULY happy--you'd let me follow my heart and marry Bob." Amy discards her Success (Paper) result, then passes the Failure to Chad (as he's most likely to come up with a good Complication), and passes one each of the Neutral (Scissors) dice to Bob and Chad. It's not looking good for Amy, but Bob's turn is next.<br/>Bob: "Pass--I want to marry Amy, too!"<br/>Chad: "Alrighty, you love birds"--he puts forward the Failure (Rock, Resolve)--"your mom sets her jaw, scowls at you, and says 'You can marry that good-for-nothing party boy when I'm in my grave, but not sooner!'" Chad discards the Failure die; it's Amy's turn.<br/>Bob: "I interrupt"--he puts forward his Scissors--"I walk into the kitchen, having heard that last line from outside the screen door, while walking up to ask Amy to go on a stroll. I'm using my Resolve 3" Bob rolls: Scissors, Scissors, Rock. "Woot! Two Success and a Neutral--good luck, Chad! OK, I say, 'Ma'am, you know we'll just elope--do you want to lose your daughter or gain a son?' My agenda is the same as Amy's" He discards one of his Scissors, and passes the Neutral Rock to Amy. Chad sighs; it's now Amy's turn.<br/>Amy: "I'm using this as a Success for myself and I say, 'That's right, Mama. I'll leave you all alone, like Daddy left us years all those years ago!'" Because Bob interrupted, it's now Chad's turn (Amy's last Neutral).<br/>Chad: "Damn, that's cold. Fine then, your mom bursts out in tears, clutching at your sleeve and saying, 'So you WOULD put me in my grave, then, 'cause I'll die if you do that to me--I... I'll kill myself'" (Recall that he's narrating a Scissors as a Failure for Amy's stake.)<br/>Amy: "I'm out of dice and yielding the stake... for now. 'Now, now, Mama... enough crazy talk. We won't elope; let's just drop it for now, OK?'"<br/>Bob: "But I still have a Success, so *I* can win without a possible Complication. Hmmm...

This avoids the "I rolled all Success, so it's moot--I win!" or "I rolled all Failure, so it's moot--I am hosed"; someone could turn the tide enough for you that Burning an MO point is enough to prevail. And giving more freedom to the other players with your given-away dice has got to be good.<br/><br/>Note that, as always, the MO of the given die MUST inform or influence the narration, regardless of whether narrating a Success of Failure.<br/><br/>ADDITIONAL NOTE: One may Burn ANY MO, for a free Success--and, as always, must use that MO to inform or influence the narration. SO, for instance, I could be using Resolve as my "rolled MO" and, needing another Success, Burn Flexibility. THis, again, should make for more vaired and interesting narration (less one-trick-ponyism).<br/><br/>Anyone have more thoughts, or should I just take this to my own site for final development?

So if you started with Resolve, the next player may only introduce him- or herself and state goals using Manipulation or Flexibility (and the following player introducing a character into the scene may only invoke the remaining MO).

It seems to remove some of the strategy of play discussed earlier and replace it with a more loosey goosey pass the conch approach...is that what you wanted?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy gut tells me you don't want the die to be useable for anything once its given away.  If you do that, then all success and failure will be decided by player whim and the dice are reduced to just an over complicated ballot system for player voting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the symbols are restricted to what they can be used for, then options are creatively constrained.  If you have a Rock MO and give me a Rock die...I can only use that die to help you.  I could use it to introduce my own character's complication if one is available, to hurt someone else's scissor complication, or either way against someone else's paper complication, but I can't use it to hurt you.  I think that's a very important constraint and losing it would diminish the effectiveness of the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'll definitely want to playtest having to keep your success dice vs. being able to keep any combination of dice you like.  I think they'd play very differently from each other, but I'm not sure one is necessarily "better".  Keeping successes first is a plus in the "character advocacy" column.  But being able to choose any combination is a plus in the "gamesmanship" category (you might choose to give away successful rocks because you know they won't be useable to help a scissor player, for instance.  Plus, narratively, sometimes being able to narrate the obstacle you face is more important than narrating how you overcome that obstacle.  Either way could work well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn III.B. do you mean to state that you can ONLY keep successes?  Even if keeping successes first winds up being the way to go, I think keeping only successes wouldn't work well.  It means that you'll often be keeping fewer dice than your Trait allows...which will make the differences between MOs rather moot.  But playtesting here should help determine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not initially fond of the idea of being able to buy spent MOs back with future failures.  That would seem to me to motivate players to periodically invent conflicts they don't care about just to restore Traits.  I'm thinking just having them refresh between sessions would be fine.  If you were going for longer form rules I'd be tempted to have every group customize a refresh standard based on their genre...like "Spent Resolve refreshes whenever your declared Nemesis wins a Conflict with at least 3 net successes"<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have to introduce your character into the current scene?  Or can you do a "Meanwhile, back at the ranch" style scene.  I'd vote for the latter because having a system that could seamlessly handle multiple conflicts occuring at the same time in different places would be pretty sweet.  Also I don't think you want the new Conflict to be anything other than orthogonal to existing conflicts.  If you want to thwart me you have to use the appropriate dice to reduce my success.  You can narrate the obstacle as being your character punching me in the face, but if all you're trying to do is stop my action...that's not a goal of your own.  If you want to roll additional dice to try and get the dice you need to stop my action you can introduce your character...but then you have to declare a goal of your own that is at risk while you hope to get dice to stop me with (2/3s of the dice you roll on average would be useable to stop me).  If you want to support me...its just the reverse.  But I would actually completely forbid goals that are the same or opposed to existing goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn reflection, I think leaving the option to have MOs up to 5 will work ok, I'd earlier recommended reducing that to 3 max...but the 1 MO in play at a time restriction should suffice as a sufficient offset to people who rely on one high MO.  I can easily hamstring your chances simply by claiming that MO before you even if its not my best suit.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou didn't comment at all on my GM brainstorm.  Its not included in your latest version update, but I'd find your thoughts on it interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180776/#Comment_180776" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-29T14:29:24+00:00" title="November 29, 2008  2:29PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2008 7:21PM by David Artman.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I just wrote a HUGE line-by-line... but it evolved as I wrote it. Easier to do a bit of a rule-change dump and explain how each answers the above.<br/>----------<br/><br/>First, the die result meanings are confused, to me. Changing to:<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">III. When it's your turn to frame a scene, choose an MO that you will be using to achieve your goal in the scene and roll five Roshambo dice. For instance, if you are using Resolve, you are "using the Rock."<br/>   1. Each die result that your MO beats in Roshambo is a Success die. Each die result that beats your MO in Roshambo is a Failure die. Each die result that matches (ties) your MO is a Neutral die.</span><br/>Just more logical, if one keeps in mind the notion that the dice are really Fortune which your character enters into struggle, to accomplish Goals. Some dice help, by succumbing to your will; some oppose, smothering your efforts; some winds fall dead in line with the edges of your sails, ready to shift either way and fill or collapse them.<br/>-----<br/><br/>For now, I'd like to table the notions of MO refreshing from Burn, but I like something like this model as a working framework for related discussion:<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">Every character has Aspirations which are accomplished in Stages, via scenes.<br/>A given Stage might take several scenes to accomplish, however, based on its complexity or difficulty.<br/>A characters agenda in a scene is called a Goal, when that agenda is not success with an entire Stage.<br/>A player may redefine a Stage any time between scenes, with one exception: an failed scene outcome can not become a new/alternate Stage for the failing character. This rule could mean that previously accomplished Stages become moot, and an Aspiration must be completely re-planned or abandoned in favor of a new Aspiration.<br/>When an Aspiration is accomplished, the player may revalue all of his or her MOs, up to a total value of 9.<br/>[If I add advancement rules]:<br/>Every two Aspirations that a character accomplishes increases the character's MO value total by 1.</span><br/><br/>I'm hoping this is enough... but if not, after playtesting, I'll work on it some more. Yes, it will need some good text to explain how to build up the Stages and Goals (a combo of Beliefs and Best Interests development).<br/>-----<br/><br/>I have come up with two ways to deal with passed dice while still mitigating the problems of extreme results (all of one die result, I feel, will lead to dull play scenes).<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">Passed die results are Successes or Failures or Neutrals with regards to only your Goal [original rules]; but any passed die may be discarded by the recipient to self-introduce.</span><br/>This "Permission To Intro" rule change keeps the original rules' feel that Fortune's first results matter, but it also opens up more opportunity to intertwine characters.<br/><br/>Alternately, there's the "Chance To Become Neutral" rule change:<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">Passed die results remain associated with your Goal (S/F/N), with one addition: If another player who received a Neutral die uses the Neutral to self-introduce, and the MO of the die you passed is one that the other player uses, then the recipient may use the passed die to self-introduce also (and he or she must, of course, use the last MO not in use already in the scene).<br/><b>Example:</b> You use Resolve 1 (Rock), and roll Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Paper, Rock. That's 2 Successes, 2 Failures, and a Neutral.<br/>You give both Failures (Scissors) to Amy and the Success and Neutral to Bob.<br/>After you narrate your Opening Volley, Bob uses the Neutral to self-intro, choosing Manipulation (Scissors)--either of Amy's Failures (Scissors) may now be used to self-intro herself (with the only MO left, Manipulation/Paper) leaving the other Failure either to make a Complication for you (and only you) or to be discarded.</span><br/>This is slick in handling mechanics because, with every player having their own five dice of one color and with self-intro involving discarding a Neutral or Become-Neutral die, one never really has to keep track of what a Neutral becomes--it is always associated with the original roller's Goal. No dice side flipping; no flexing dice into re-targeting another player. Just straight-forward "what color is it, who's color is that, what MO did they use?" and your done.<br/>Additionally, the side always tells the current narrator using the die what MO must be used, remember. I may not have made that clear enough, but even with the (above) "passed dice can be used for anything" key change, the passed die MO constrained the recipient's narration to the die side's MO. I think I am OK with killing that rule in favor of one of these changes, but a passed die was never just a carte blanche, it always had an impact on whether Resolve, Flexibility, or Manipulation was to be taken into account in how it was a Success or Failure for the passer's Goal.<br/><br/>[NOTE TO SELF: Add a little set of cards (3, one per MO) so a person can put their MO-in-use in front of them, for recall.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180777/#Comment_180777" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-29T14:30:07+00:00" title="November 29, 2008  2:30PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued)<br/><br/>So you see that I've reverted the original rules about die results, and have two ways to extend them. The latter requires an additional rule to mitigate the dull narration that I imagine will result from overwhelming Success or Failure with no Neutral results. The problem is rooted in the rules that limit scenes to only one active, unanswered Success or Failure narration--it makes moot extra Success or Failures. But these rule changes can break that up:<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">D.2 Use the die to narrate a Complication\u2014something which opposes your Goal\u2014against you, taking into account the MO of the die result (Resolve, Manipulation, or Flexibility) not the original player's MO.<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> A player may only create a(nother) Complication if there is no current, unresolved Complication in the scene.</span></span><br/>Pile on the Complications, in turn order, if you want! Fate can be cruel. Situations can spiral out of control. There's always another way around a problem, in a new scene.<br/><br/>Also:<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">IV.F (old F becomes G) Any additional Successes may be used to narrate follow-on bonuses or accomplishments or boons, as related to your agenda in the scene.</span><br/>Mama not only grants her blessings on my her daughter's wedding, she also give the young couple the family heirloom dining set and tableware, to help them start their household. Basically, you can accomplish more than one Goal, with slick narration of Successes after Bypassing all Complications.<br/>-----<br/><br/>With regards to passing only Successes, what else can I do? What else makes MO relevant at all (disregard Burn here, for now)?<br/><br/>I recognize a problem with being limited on Successes kept with no limit on Failures passed--it stacks bad odds. I have a COOL idea, I think:<br/>What if, similarly to how your MO limits the number of Successes that you may keep, it also mitigates how many Failures you must pass? I see two ways to do it, the latter I think cooler still:<br/>1) 5 - your MO = max passed Failure dice. This could mean either:<br/>(a) an MO maxes at 4 and you may only have a total MO value of 7, or<br/>(b) one rolls 6 dice, with current MO points distribution.<br/><br/>2) Distribute 9 Success points and 9 Failure points between the three MOs<br/><br/>The former makes more consistent character types: if you're good in something, you don't fail spectacularly at it (and even masters CAN fail, but only with 1 die). The latter makes for very interesting, dynamic characters: I could have Resolve 5S and 5F--I can succeed or fail wildy; my Resolve is at Fate's mercy. Or I could have a Resolve 5S 1F--I tend to succeed, and when I fail it ain't by much.<br/><br/>Frankly, unless you see a BIG hole, 2.b is going to become a rule.<br/><br/>In summation on all your points about the subject of "what do I keep"--I think simpler is better, both for my target demographic and for speed of play (it takes time to come up with constrained narration). I also don't like the idea of trying to explain why it could be FUN to narrate one's own Complications--I am more on the side of character agency than story uber alles. I could see a Designer's Note sidebar with that variation for experimentation, though.... Let folks figure out the "baseline" game of My Guy before branching out into a more authorial stance, guiding others with self-Complication.<br/>-----<br/>On that note, I am generally going to stick on the No GM side, unless there's some glaring hole in the structure of conflict framing and cycling that needs a "guidance" role. As it stands, players can build their own Aspirations and Stages, and everyone should easily grok how to push for themselves, against and with others as needs must (as dice drive opportunity).<br/><br/>I also fear the game turning trad, with a GM providing opposition. I don't want players to ever feel like teaming up on a near-permanent basis is a best tactic, because a GMs is out there framing opposition to all their Goals. Similarly, I don't want to put a burden on one player to become the GM-as-fascilitator, trying to herd players into opposing each other and tweaking situations to keep everyone at odds.<br/><br/>I really want a Diplomacy vibe: early, we players are sort of around the edges of the game, each aimed inward, but able to find allies and common ground for a time. But as Stages wither and Aspirations regroup, the knives come out, kings are sometimes made, and a story resolves and closes. A new one might begin (episodic, serials), but anything that turns players into permanent allies is bad. And I think a GM is as likely to do that as skillfully pluck and prod a situation to that point.<br/><br/>It's Complicated, not Dogs in the Vineyard, to use indie shorthand.<br/>(Or Universalis, not Hero! ;^) )<br/>-----                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180778/#Comment_180778" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-29T14:30:28+00:00" title="November 29, 2008  2:30PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued... you are too kind)<br/><br/>Self-introing to frame a distant scene could also be an "Advanced Technique," but it should always be knit to the source scene (which is hard for learning gamers, and even seasoned ones and skilled authors!). I don't want some random passed Neutral die to be a license to steal the limelight, dragging other players into YOUR (inserted spotlight) scene away from the scene of the poor schlub who gave up the Neutral. SO it would always have to relate, knit in, shadow, echo the source scene. Not easy. But a worthy suggestion for advanced players.<br/><br/>That said, I totally concur with you idea that a self-intro from a passed die can not be done to negate or parrot the passer's Goal. I would, however, permit the new character in a scene to have a Goal that is mutually exclusive to (with?) the passer's. If have a Goal to convince Mama I should marry someone, it's perfectly fine for someone else to have the same Goal, even though they technically negate each other... or DO they? Maybe Mama's a swinger, too! &gt;:^&gt;<br/>----------<br/><br/>Again, mucho gracis and all that! If the branching of potential variations and rules is giving you a head-ache, lemme know (it's getting uner my dome, that's for sure). I haven't been clear with goals, as they've sort of been a moving target. That's dev, I guess--started with a toss-off notion for how to use some dice I saw rendered by some guy. Next thing I now I'm balancing edge cases, deciding what complexity level fits my target demographic (Woah! having a target demographic!), considering handling and speed of play, and drawing lines in sand about distribution of narrative authority and flexibility of scene framing.<br/><br/>I could almost see this as some kind of exploding game toolkit: pick a few "tonal" options or a "vibe" your want or a play structure, roll a "game complexity" to your desired level, and the rules click through core and dependent variations to build a system that suits the constraint level your group desires, the number of options and moving parts and framing tricks you want to us. **head splodes**                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181179/#Comment_181179" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-02T08:52:32+00:00" title="December  2, 2008  8:52AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2008 8:58AM by David Artman.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, if you don't want to dig through all the above whys and wherefores, here's the updated rules:<br/><a href="http://davidartman.com/systems/roshambo-dice" rel="nofollow">http://davidartman.com/systems/roshambo-dice</a><br/><br/>For the two options on how to use passed dice, I went with the simpler one: use as it is (Success, Failure, or free to choose) or to self-intro. I think it's unlikely that a beginning gamer would grok the idea of a die changing what it can do based on someone else's MO during a self-intro... hell, it confuses me a bit, still. I don't think folks would recognize the opportunity often enough... but anyone can remember "it's a Success or Failure for the roller's MO... or you choose, if Neutral... and regardless, you may discard it to self-intro."<br/><br/>Added basic Advancement system, too--it's simple enough to figure out. I also have a "regression" system that is kind of unique. Both together, though, means that someone could eventually hit 5 &amp; 5 on every MO, which makes the dice totally in charge. That might be a feature, not a flaw--with experiences good and bad, one learns to follow Fate's whims (i.e. one can keep every Success rolled without having to pass it and risk someone using it to self-intro; and one must pass every Failure, with no discards due to low Flub rating).<br/><br/>Barring glaring holes, I am going to "lock" this version down for purposes of playtest. We will use d6s, with 5-6 beating 3-4 beating 1-2 beating 5-6. I encourage others to give it a whirl and post APs (or just rule issues, here in this thread).<br/><br/>Thanks, folks, for reading... thanks more for helping... thanks a ton for testing!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
