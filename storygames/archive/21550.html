My favorite designs include fixes to ensure it never comes down to a debate whether to engage the mechanics or not (even if it's just a crude fix such as one player always having the last word, no questions asked).<br/><br/>The advantage of "spelling out moves" explicitly is having more tightly defined triggers. <i>Ideally</i>, those triggers will actually be unambiguous enough there is never a deliberate choice whether to engage those mechanics - it just happens or not, based on purely fictional constraints (AW <i>approaches</i> that, and the reason we've spent threads over threads arguing about the "Go Aggro" move is certainly that's the one place those rules stray the furthest from being unambiguously straightforward).<br/>A side benefit to this design approach is a game can then - if desired - include multiple subsystems for resolving the different kinds of conflict, and have those differ in more than just small details.<br/><br/>Of course, while I enormously enjoy AW playbooks as a way of rule presentation, the latter sort of design doesn't actually require them. This quote, for example, is from Meguey Baker's <i>Psi*Run</i> (possibly the most heavily played implementation of <i>Otherkind</i> dice mechanics):\n<blockquote><h3>When do we roll dice?</h3>\nRoll dice as soon as any Runner takes significant action. Remember that a significant action is something that:<br/>\u2022 can go right or can go wrong<br/>\u2022 shows off the Runner\u2019s exceptionality<br/>\u2022 could potentially trigger a memory<br/>\u2022 takes time and focus<br/>\u2022 might expose the Runner to danger or unwanted attention</blockquote>\nThat's basically a list of moves, or rather a list of triggers for the game's one make-it-with-the-dice move. Sure, some are more unambiguous than others - "shows off the Runner\u2019s exceptionality" is perhaps up for debate, and the language of "could" and "might" seems to leave an option of saying "this might not" - but as <i>Psi*Run</i> GM I've generally found this list was more than enough basis for me to tell, unambiguously, when to ask for a roll, and for my fellow players to call for it as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471444/#Comment_471444" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-05T07:27:53+00:00" title="April  5, 2018  7:27AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, what's the difference?

I can't think of a short answer: it's one of the central challenges of game design.<br/><br/>I DO think that the recent fad of PbtA games has brought back an interest in "moves" (which are, really, an evolution of D&amp;D's game design, so it's going back to basic here), and more generic mechanism for resolving conflicts have gone out of favour... I fully expect this to reverse again sooner or later. Generic conflict resolution techniques or "freeform moves" are incredibly powerful technology.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471464/#Comment_471464" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-06T04:56:06+00:00" title="April  6, 2018  4:56AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the magic with Moves happens in PBTA games when you have Moves with strictly circumscribed circumstances, so the player is incentivized to do stuff that lets him/her use their Move. A good example in Apocalypse World is the Gunlugger vs. the Brainer; the Gunlugger's moves are mostly things that work in combat, so the Gunlugger is always itching for combat.  The Brainer's moves all involve messing with people's nervous systems; while they can be very effective in combat (like in the sample combat in the rule book), they are more likely to be looking for situations where they can use their Moves without meeting violent resistance.  <br/><br/>The Masks RPG does this really well, to the point that PCs  will shape their casual post-battle conversations with teammates to allow them to trigger Moves, which also helps make sure those conversations hit on relevant themes for those characters.  <br/><br/>At its best, these Moves drive thematic and genre-appropriate development of the stories; at worst, they can leave the player feeling like they only have one good trick to pull, or even feel powerless if the setting doesn't allow for them to use their tricks.  <br/><br/>But this design technique really goes back to D&amp;D, where some character classes get all-purpose specialties, like fighting with swords or casting spells, while others like the Thief/Rogue have very specific specialties which are pretty much wasted unless the DM gives them opportunities to find traps and pick locks.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
