I'm hoping there might be some probability-calculating experts here who can talk me through whether my current approach and Simon's approach are roughly comparable.<br/><br/><hr/><br/>At the moment, the way conflicts are resolved is a variation of the Sorceror dice mechanics: \n<ul>\n<li>There are 7d6 on the table<br/></li><li>The player rolls between 1 and 6 of those d6  (the exact number depends on the value of the stat the PC is using)<br/></li><li>The GM rolls all the remaining dice (eg. if the player rolls 5 dice, the GM rolls 2 dice)<br/></li><li>The player and GM compare the highest result they got in each of their dice pools: the person with the highest result is the winner<br/></li><li>Tied highest results are discarded until there's a clear winner<br/></li><li>The winner gets a number of 'victory points' equal to the number of their dice that beat the loser's highest result.<br/></li>\n</ul>For example, Malcolm rolls four dice, and Steve rolls three dice. They get these results:<br/><br/>Malcolm: 6, 5, 4, 4<br/>Steve: 5, 4, 2<br/><br/>Malcolm wins with one success. He has one die that's higher than Steve's 5.<br/><br/>To illustrate the 'tied dice' rules, say they get these results:<br/><br/>Malcolm: 6, 5, 5, 4<br/>Steve: 6, 4, 2<br/><br/>Both Malcolm and Steve would throw away their tied '6' results. Malcolm would then win with two successes (he has two dice that are higher than Steve's 4).<br/><br/><hr/><br/>Simon's suggestion is to simplify all that, and just have the player roll a number of d6 equal to the value of their stat (so, between 1 and 6 dice). Any 4s, 5s, or 6s count as successes and get converted to 'victory points'.<br/><br/>So, if Malcolm has a 'Money' stat of 4, he rolls 4 dice ...<br/><br/>Malcolm: 6, 5, 3, 1<br/><br/>... giving him two successes.<br/><br/><hr/><br/>Are these two approaches roughly equivalent?<br/><br/>Is there an alternative approach that's simpler?<br/><br/>My intention with Left Coast's conflict resolution system is that when you're rolling with higher stats, you'll generate quite a few victory points, but still have the possibility of failure. Any suggestions for simplifying my current approach will be gratefully received.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345508/#Comment_345508" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-10T22:16:07+00:00" title="October 10, 2011 10:16PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing that jumps out to me is that Simon's suggestion gives the player 0-n victory points and the GM none, unless you intend that both parties will roll some dice? <br/><br/>Maybe a 1, or 1-2, generates a victory point for the GM?

WIth four dice, for example, the player will fail only six times in a hundred. Technically, that is a "possibility" of failing, but not one that matters much.<br/><br/>Both systems can build as many successes as there are dice, theoretically. I don't know if that counts as "quite a few". <br/><br/>Any system which uses a pool of dice to hit a certain number, the tool to use is this question: for a target X, what is the chance of not hitting that number on all dice. That is, what are the odds of all dice failing? So, say you are rolling four dice and want 4 or better to succeed. A total failure happens only if all dice roll three or less. For die, there are six possible outcomes, three of which fail. This is 3/6 or 1/2. Since one die does not affect the others, each die is an <a href="http://people.richland.edu/james/lecture/m170/ch05-rul.html" rel="nofollow">independent event</a>. The rule for independent events is to multiple the probabilities for each die. You are rolling four dice, so all of them failing is 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/16 = 0.0625 = 6.25%.<br/><br/>More generally, probability of failing:<br/><br/>n = number of dice<br/>t = target number<br/>d = sides per die<br/>P(n,t,d) = ((t-1)/d)<sup>n</sup><br/><br/>That is the failure case. But what if you didn't fail? That would mean that <i>at least one</i> of the dice was a four or higher. The probability of the "not fail" case is 1 minus the probability of the fail case, or (1 - 1/16) = 15/16 = 0.9375 = 93.75%.<br/><br/>The original system, things get more tricky. You need to look at each outcome. As an example:<br/><br/>n = number of dice for the player<br/>g = number of dice for the gm = 7 - n<br/><br/>Will the player win with a six? Well, chances of him at least one six: 1 - (5/6)<sup>n</sup>. Chances of the GM not getting any 6's: (5/6)<sup>g</sup>. These are independent, so odds of this happening are:<br/><br/>(1 - (5/6)<sup>n</sup>) * (5/6)<sup>g</sup><br/><br/>Will the player win with a five? Player needs at least one five, GM needs none:<br/><br/>(1 - (4/6)<sup>n</sup>) * (4/6)<sup>g</sup><br/><br/>Note, however, that this result includes the results where the player gets at at least one six, so those need to be subtracted off. In short, it's a mess.<br/><br/>Better off simulating it, most likely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345603/#Comment_345603" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T16:00:08+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  4:00PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Lester. Those comments are really useful: for the first time, I feel like I'm really having to come to grips with whether the outputs of my resolution system are a good match for what I want it to achieve.<br/><br/>I've tried a simplified system where players roll anywhere between 1 to 4 d6, and they succeed on a '5' or a '6'. Having a play with anydice.com gives me <a href="http://anydice.com/program/b31" rel="nofollow">this distribution</a>.<br/><br/>I like this distribution, which gives a reasonable chance of gaining one or two successes while keeping failure a reasonably common option.<br/><br/>(Reducing the maximum value of the stats down to 4 is also going to help players run through the game's medium-term reward cycle more quickly, and create more frequent boom/bust cycles where their PCs' lives seem to be ticking along great and then suddenly crash.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345618/#Comment_345618" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T20:40:53+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  8:40PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the system as is. <br/><br/>Reminds me of Risk a little. <br/><br/>Which is such an epic resolution system. The match the highest (and the second highest if both players rolled at least 2d); lower score loses an army (thus up to a maximum of two armies); defender wins ties. Which allows for epic defenses even if the armies are 20 : 1.<br/><br/>So, I think that depending on your design goals, this could apply to ties. The player should always win ties and you only ever match the least number of dice. That means that the player rolling 1d versus 6d still has a chance to walk away with one victory point, rather than rolling a six and then the GM walking away with five victory points. <br/><br/>FREX<br/><br/>GM rolls: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1<br/>STEVE rolls: 6<br/><br/>STEVE gets one victory point.<br/><br/>Whereas,<br/><br/>GM rolls: 6, 4, 2, 2<br/>STEVE rolls: 6, 5, 5<br/><br/>STEVE gets three victory points.<br/><br/>Whereas,<br/><br/>GM rolls: 6, 6, 2, 1<br/>STEVE rolls: 5, 4, 3, 2<br/><br/>GM gets two victory points; STEVE gets one. <br/><br/>All that being said, I think the system is more or less fine as is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345621/#Comment_345621" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T21:08:32+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  9:08PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wordman</cite>Better off simulating it, most likely.</blockquote>\nI wrote a quick program to calculate the odds for the original method.  <br/><br/>Stats for stat = 1<br/>0 : 92.7%<br/>1 :  7.3%<br/>Stats for stat = 2<br/>0 : 80.3%<br/>1 : 16.9%<br/>2 :  2.7%<br/>Stats for stat = 3<br/>0 : 62.0%<br/>1 : 29.0%<br/>2 :  7.4%<br/>3 :  1.6%<br/>Stats for stat = 4<br/>0 : 38.0%<br/>1 : 41.9%<br/>2 : 12.7%<br/>3 :  5.8%<br/>4 :  1.6%<br/>Stats for stat = 5<br/>0 : 19.7%<br/>1 : 42.9%<br/>2 : 16.2%<br/>3 : 11.5%<br/>4 :  6.9%<br/>5 :  2.7%<br/>Stats for stat = 6<br/>0 :  7.3%<br/>1 : 29.6%<br/>2 : 14.2%<br/>3 : 14.3%<br/>4 : 14.2%<br/>5 : 12.9%<br/>6 :  7.3%<br/><br/>I think that's correct.

A line like "2     27266      2.0%" means that, of the million tests for that number of player dice, the player scored exactly 2 victory points in 27,266 of them, which is 2% of the total. Negative victory points for the player indicates victory points gained by the gm.<br/><br/>Not positive the code is correct, but it looks reasonable.

Doesn't materially affect the numbers, but is why the percentages all end in .0.)<br/><br/><code>$ python leftcoastsim.py <br/><br/>Count of how many times player scores X victory points with 1 dice (1000000 total tests)<br/> -6     73090      7.0%<br/> -5     295433    29.0%<br/> -4     142543    14.0%<br/> -3     143452    14.0%<br/> -2     142648    14.0%<br/> -1     129245    12.0%<br/>  1     73589      7.0%<br/><br/>Count of how many times player scores X victory points with 2 dice (1000000 total tests)<br/> -5     27162      2.0%<br/> -4     100211    10.0%<br/> -3     212617    21.0%<br/> -2     217653    21.0%<br/> -1     245411    24.0%<br/>  1     169680    16.0%<br/>  2     27266      2.0%<br/><br/>Count of how many times player scores X victory points with 3 dice (1000000 total tests)<br/> -4     16653      1.0%<br/> -3     78093      7.0%<br/> -2     193789    19.0%<br/> -1     330161    33.0%<br/>  1     270326    27.0%<br/>  2     94439      9.0%<br/>  3     16539      1.0%<br/><br/>Count of how many times player scores X victory points with 4 dice (1000000 total tests)<br/> -3     16355      1.0%<br/> -2     94500      9.0%<br/> -1     269403    26.0%<br/>  1     331315    33.0%<br/>  2     193445    19.0%<br/>  3     78734      7.0%<br/>  4     16248      1.0%<br/><br/>Count of how many times player scores X victory points with 5 dice (1000000 total tests)<br/> -2     27024      2.0%<br/> -1     169060    16.0%<br/>  1     244998    24.0%<br/>  2     217801    21.0%<br/>  3     212787    21.0%<br/>  4     101131    10.0%<br/>  5     27199      2.0%<br/><br/>Count of how many times player scores X victory points with 6 dice (1000000 total tests)<br/> -1     73957      7.0%<br/>  1     129440    12.0%<br/>  2     142394    14.0%<br/>  3     143582    14.0%<br/>  4     142242    14.0%<br/>  5     295283    29.0%<br/>  6     73102      7.0%<br/></code> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345898/#Comment_345898" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-13T20:01:36+00:00" title="October 13, 2011  8:01PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John and Lester, thank you for creating those simulations! That's great work - they will give me a good starting point for figuring out how those probability curves feel in play. What I noticed first off is that it looks like the failure rate (where a player scores no victory points) is pretty harsh when the player is rolling very few dice.<br/><br/><hr/><br/>Nathan, thanks for that Risk alternative. I'm not quite sure what's going on with the last example: could you talk me through why both the GM and Steve get victory points from their rolls?<br/><br/><hr/><br/>Hi Per!<br/><br/>As a preface, I really took the results of your playtest - about the need to simplify and clarify pretty much all aspects of the game - to heart. Changing the dice mechanics is really something I hadn't considered before: I've just assumed that's what I should do, based on the fact that that's what I first came up with.<br/><br/>The current mechanics seem fiddly to me for three reasons:<br/><br/>1. I have to write a lot of instructions for the current 'Sorcerer' style mechanics, whereas I can explain the BW style mechanics in about three sentences.<br/>2. Players need to handle (and acquire) quite a few dice.<br/>3. There's a little bit of time involved in calculating the outcome of a conflict (which can take people out of the game).<br/><br/>When I couple those reasons with a comparison of the success/failure rates between the two methods, I think I'm starting to prefer (or at least want to test out) something that feels a little different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345907/#Comment_345907" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-13T20:39:17+00:00" title="October 13, 2011  8:39PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 13, 2011 9:46PM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, so in Risk [and not in Left Coast] you roll usually three dice if you're attacking and two dice if you're defending. You then compare the highest and second highest results from each player respectively. Sometimes, you get situations where both sides lose an army.<br/><br/>EG<br/><br/>Attacking Player gets: <span style="color: #FF0000;">6, 2, 2</span><br/><br/>and the Defending Player gets: <span style="color: #00FF00;">5, 3</span><br/><br/>So, you match the highest respective dice <span style="color: #FF0000;">[6]</span> and <span style="color: #00FF00;">[5]</span>, thus AP wins, and then the second highest respective dice <span style="color: #FF0000;">[2]</span> and <span style="color: #00FF00;">[3]</span>, and the defending player wins. The extra <span style="color: #FF0000;">[2]</span> die is disregarded. <br/><br/>If you were to adopt this for Left Coast, that means that some results would mean that both the GM and the Player might get victory points.<br/><br/>In the example I gave, the third highest respective dice match, the Player won, because [3] is better than [2].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345910/#Comment_345910" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-13T21:31:25+00:00" title="October 13, 2011  9:31PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent - that makes sense.
