I've been knocked unconscious."<br/><br/>One perennial trope of the teen supernatural genre has been the convenient ability of all bad guys to knock well-meaning regular cast characters out at the slightest of blows (thus taking them out of the action, but still able to recover in time to give the hero the critical information as to where the villains have gone).<br/><br/>There's nothing specific in the Monsterhearts mechanics about it, so I was wondering how people were incorporating PCs losing consciousness?<br/><br/>I've previously simply treated it as a condition in order to end a PC v NPC fight without killing a PC by using a hard move to get a string and then spend the string to impose the condition. Is anyone doing anything different? I don't mind giving a villain with a string on the Witch geek the ability to creep up behind her, spend the string to knock her out and take her prisoner, but it feels less right for a weedy PC Fae to be able to spend a string to instantly knock out a Chosen at the beginning of a fight. What approach have people been taking?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387109/#Comment_387109" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-14T17:36:48+00:00" title="August 14, 2012  5:36PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            you're groggy and winded, the fell creatures are looming and Valdamir has his claws raised for one final blow to end your misery.
