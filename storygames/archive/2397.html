                    First, have a look <a href="http://www.ennieawards.com/judgenominees.html" rel="nofollow"> at the list of nominees</a>.<br/><br/>So, I'll be brutally honest here. If you think I'm wrong, please do tell me why.<br/><br/>Kathryn Gertie-Barden doesn't have much to recommend her: she's enthusiastic, she's done something with ENWorld before and she's played "everything from Amber to D&amp;D". It strikes me that she's hoping to get elected because she's well known on ENWorld.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Bauman is pretty much the same: "valued member of the ENWorld family" doesn't wash with me and the feminity thing isn't much of a recommendation (there's other females in the running).<br/><br/>There's something I rather like about Andrew Branstad. It's the way he talks about games as if he really, really enjoys them. I like that. <br/><br/>Not sure about Tim Bruns. He gets a black mark from me, right off, for "even tried LARPing", and apart from that he seems to have been to a lot of conventions.<br/><br/>I like Mark Causey. He plays lots of different sorts of games and he wants to get his group to have fun. That's good for me.<br/><br/>Michael Crow? The gaming experience impresses me, but not the reviewing experience. He's an OK choice, probably. Why doesn't he name the indie RPGs?<br/><br/>Sean Frackowiak's picture puts me right off. So does the fact he's "unafraid of making blunt assessments". I appreciate the honesty, but he'll be near the bottom of my list.<br/><br/>Chris Gath "reads and rereads RPG books", which strikes me as a bit weird. Apart from that, he spends a lot of time on RPG sites. It's not a great recommendation, I think.<br/><br/>I quite like Scott Hall because he seems to enjoy the games he lists. I'm not sure where I get that impression from.<br/><br/>Oh, that's what Jessica Hammer looks like! Huh. Honestly, when I started this post, I thought she'd forgotten to submit her nomination. But there she is. I nominated her, so I can hardly comment unbiasedly.<br/><br/>Graham Johnson plays a lot of games, which is good, but he owns lots of games just to read, which is bad. <br/><br/>I like Kevin Kulp's selection of games (Call of Cthulhu, Paranoia), because I like those games.<br/> He's a video game designer, so his opinion of RPGs would be interesting. And I like the way he gets involved: he's MCed the awards and he's been a site admin. But wait. He's written and playtested RPGs professionally? How is he eligible to stand?<br/><br/>FranÃ§ois Labrecque seems to like the games he plays, but I'm not seeing much to make him stand out.<br/><br/>Not sure about Robert Miller. I don't like the way he writes his bio, really: he starts with "I have the time", which isn't, to me, a great recommendation; and then he talks about the way he posts on forums. I wish he'd talk about the way he gamed instead.<br/><br/>Stuart Parker has a good selection of games which I like. Also, I like the way that, although he's judged for the Ennies before, he doesn't seem to <i>expect</i> to win.<br/><br/>I like Jeff Ranger's backstory, but again, it makes me wonder: how is he eligible to stand? The phrase "He appreciates your repeated placement of him in the august company of his fellow Judges for the entirety of the ENnies existence to this point" strikes a bad note: I'm not going to vote for someone based on the fact that everyone else voted for him before. But, still, something about him I like.<br/><br/>Christopher Richeson's main recommendation is that he's reviewed loads of products. I'm not sure that's a great recommendation. However, I like that he mentions the smaller press games.<br/><br/>Doug Ruff is English, so he's probably get a vote from me. I like the mention of Tunnels and Trolls, but I wish he'd talk more about what he plays now, rather than where he posts.<br/><br/>Jeremy Ware says he'll <i>playtest</i> the games, so he'll definitely get a vote from me.<br/><br/>What do you think? Be honest about people's qualifications, but keep away from flaming them (there's a fine line).<br/><br/>Graham                </div>

                            I had no idea Teflon Billy's name wasn't William. In any case, he's always been OK by me online and the time I met him at GenCon he was very cool. He's been a really solid and fair judge every year IMHO.                        </div>

                            Well I crafted a couple questions on the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23250.0" rel="nofollow">Forge thread</a> where the judges are answering Forgies questions. I tried to weight them so there wasn't an easy cop out answer. I also tried to weight them so the answer I wanted to see wasn't apparent.  So far I've been most impressed with Doug Ruff's answering of those questions. He's striking me as blunt, and honest, and not afraid to give people the answers they don't want. This is causing me to think he has some integrity, as bluntness, and honesty are qualities I like. Integrity is what I think is most important in a judge.<br/>
<br/>
I'd encourage other folks to craft some hard questions in the same manner now that I've revealed my terrible secret.                        </div>

                            Well, I'm honest enough to admit I've read this thread... Graham, as the OP, could you tell me whether you want judges to contribute here? I suspect it's better if we butt out - but if so, I'd like to see some of those concerns (especially concerns about eligibility, which could be damaging) posted as questions somewhere else so that the judges have a fair chance to respond.<br/>

                            I have the same concerns Doug does, so please feel free to tell me to butt out.  I do have a few points I'd like to make.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding playtesting the products: I really don't see this as a possibility.  Maybe a couple of games get put into someone's normal RPG night, but the judges are being given hundreds of products.  In previous years judges have taken an entire week off work towards the end in order to finish reading and evaluating these products.  Most judges in the ENWorld thread just flat out said they wouldn't playtest, as it's too many products as it is.  I said I might playtest if I suspected a product would be substantially different in play than what I got from reading it.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding my own evaluation: More than anything else I'd really like it if folk considering me would take a look at a few of my reviews that interest them.  Some folk don't seem to think much of reviewers, but I put a lot of thought and effort into my reviews.  I award high marks and low marks, and while I'm willing to reconsider my opinion of a product I do stand my ground under criticism.  I've also reviewed a lot of smaller press RPGs.  Dictionary of Mu, Spirit of the Century, Zorcerer of Zo, Don't Rest Your Head, Truth &amp; Justice, With Great Power..., Dogs in the Vineyard, and others.  I've done this because I love those games, because I think the most fun stuff is coming out of the indie movement, and because I want to raise awareness of those games.  I still love mainstream RPGs too, however, and have reviews of Wizards of the Coast, White Wolf, Pinnacle, and other big publisher products.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be great if folk would consider why people like Chris Gath, Michael Crow, other judge nominees, and myself write reviews.  If you turn it into a dollar per hour gig we make $1 - $2 an hour assuming we receive free product.  We do it to support the community and help out our hobby as best we can.<br/>
