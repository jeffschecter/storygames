Before heading overseas on a tour of duty with the military, my brother Mel charged me with taking care of his actual play podcast <i><a href="http://virtualplay.podbus.com/" rel="nofollow">Virtual Play</a></i>. I managed to produce a few episodes, but then something happened and *poof* the whole site went away. <i>I swear I had nothing to do with it!</i> To keep the flame, I created a site called <a href="http://actualreplay.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow"><i>Actual Replay</i></a>, and I just posted the first new <a href="http://actualreplay.blogspot.com/2010/05/actual-replay-1-structured-freeform-in.html" rel="nofollow">episode</a>.<br/><br/>You can find the episode on the Internet Archive <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/StructuredFreeformInTheIndieRpgDesignCommunity" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It consists of excerpts from interviews I conducted with Paul Tevis, Emily Care Boss, Chad Underkoffler (with Rob Donoghue putting in his oar), Ryan Macklin, Jason Morningstar, and jeeper Frederik Berg \xd8stergaard, and so it's a departure from the normal AP podcast format. But I think it's interesting in its own right, and it offers a glimpse of game designers grappling with ideas that challenge their assumptions about how games work. It also connects to an <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/wjw11/Blurring_the_Boundaries.doc" rel="nofollow">essay I'm working on</a> on the same topic that I've submitted to the proceedings book for the "larp summit" at <a href="http://www.wyrdcon.com/" rel="nofollow">Wyrdcon I</a> in June.<br/><br/>I should mention that if you find either the podcast or the article interesting, there's some desultory conversation you may wish to join going on at <a href="http://structured-freedom.com/forum/" rel="nofollow">Structured Freedom</a>, the forum Remi Treuer set up as a place to talk about these things. But any comments or feedback you'd care to offer here are cool as well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270988/#Comment_270988" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T13:05:02+00:00" title="May 13, 2010  1:05PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2010 1:08PM by John_Harper.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, Bill.
