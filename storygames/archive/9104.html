For example:<br/><br/>It's Misha's spotlight episode.  Grisha, his old buddy, has been instructed to kill him, but he can't because he loves him.  They both did Article 144 time in the Zone together!  Misha's got a "snitch" tattoo on his forehead he earned for saving Grisha's life!  Luckily, Grisha is muy loco and convinces his imaginary friend Ilya, dead since season one, to do the deed for him.  Because Misha needs to be killed - Ilya told him so.<br/><br/>So there's a great scene where they meet at the Chicken Masters restaurant and Misha lays out crime scene photos of Ilya's death, trying to snap Grisha out of it, and Grisha's seeing Ilya pointing a gun at Misha but it is really his hand.  Episode's almost over.  There's a conflict.<br/><br/>Misha wants Grisha to snap out of it and not kill him and return to reality.  Grisha wants "Ilya" to take Misha out, to cleanse the stain on Vor honor.  These are pretty intense stakes, but very appropriate for the spotlight, and the final episode of the season.  Cards were drawn against the Producer and both players won.<br/><br/>How do you handle binary conflicts in your PTA games?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201409/#Comment_201409" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-09T08:27:50+00:00" title="April  9, 2009  8:27AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I think there might be a couple of other hinky things going on with this scene, but I'll have to look over the rest of the Big Store info to be sure.  Anyway, it's not directly relevant to the issue of binary conflicts, I don't think.)<br/><br/>You ask far too much.<br/><br/>By that I mean you're committing the classic PTA misstep of horning in on the narrator's duties.  It's important to frame up your conflicts in terms of actions, not consequences.<br/><br/>The action Misha wants is for Grisha to acknowledge that Ilya is not real.<br/><br/>The action Grisha wants is to kill Misha.  But even that goes too far.  Grisha wants to shoot Misha.  Or Grisha wants to shoot someone.  Heck, let's cut right down to the bone and say Grisha wants to pull the trigger.<br/><br/>So, both players win.  Grisha will acknowledge that Ilya is not real, and he'll also pull the trigger.  Now it's up to the narrator to decide how that actually plays out on screen.<br/><br/>Maybe Grisha looks Misha right in the eyes, says "Of course Ilya's dead."  And then shoots Misha in the face.<br/><br/>Maybe Grisha snaps like a dry twig when he realizes the depths of his insanity, and shoots himself.<br/><br/>Maybe Grisha/Ilya calmly raises the gun, points it at Misha's face, and pulls the trigger.  Click.  Grisha says "I hid the bullets when you weren't looking, Ilya.  And I don't need you here any more."<br/><br/><br/>That's my take on it, anyway.<br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201412/#Comment_201412" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-09T08:30:40+00:00" title="April  9, 2009  8:30AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2009 8:40AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, that makes a lot of sense.

But even that goes too far.  Grisha wants to shoot Misha.  Or Grisha wants to shoot someone.  Heck, let's cut right down to the bone and say Grisha wants to pull the trigger.</blockquote>\nRoger, I think I agree with what you're trying to say, but I would phrase things differently. I agree with you that the players were infringing on the narrator's duties, but I disagree with how you propose setting stakes.<br/><br/>I'm not a PTA guru, but the way I generally approach "conflict resolution" is to ask what is the <i>effect</i> that the player wants to see, rather than what is the "action" they want to perform. The issue with the above situation---as I understand it solely from Jason's description---is that the players were declaring both the effect they wanted to see, as well as how the effect was to be manifested. The "manifestation" part is what should be left up to narration.<br/><br/>The thing is, if you focus on "action", rather than "effect", you might end up with a narration that doesn't respect what the player thought they were getting when they won the conflict. For example, let's assume that Grisha's player was actually envisioning killing Misha. If the stake was set as "Grisha pulls the trigger", and the narration came out as Grisha shooting himself, then there's a good chance the player might feel cheated, as that's pretty much the opposite of what they thought they were winning.<br/><br/>So based solely on Jason's description, it seems to me that Grisha's stake should have been "Misha is killed", or possibly "the stain on Vor honor is cleansed" if that was what the player was really trying to get at. Of course, depending on what exactly the player wanted, the stake could have been set as "Misha pulls the trigger", but that doesn't seem consistent with Jason's description.<br/><br/>Does that make sense? Is there some reason why this approach wouldn't work for PTA, or why another approach is more desirable?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>How do you handle binary conflicts in your PTA games?</blockquote>\nAgain, I'm not a PTA guru, but generally speaking, if you focus on the "effect" question, I often find that stakes begin to differentiate themselves. If they still seem binary, the thing I do is just "zoom out" and talk about the situation as a player with my fellow group members, to see if we can "talk out" or negotiate appropriate non-binary stakes.<br/><br/>PS---The "effect" question is just a re-phrasing of the whole "player intent" idea.

Perhaps it's just that it seems to dismiss whatever intent the players may have had in announcing those actions, giving the narrator (either one of the players or the Director) an excessive amount of control over the story's direction.  <br/><br/>For example, if we assume that the actions here are "Grisha shoots at Misha" and "Misha shows grisly photos to Grisha", it leaves the door open for almost anything to happen during narration.  Aside from throwing everything they have into winning narration rights (not just winning the conflict), the players would seem to have no power to guide or frame the conflict and its results.<br/><br/>Is it assumed that the narrator is taking everyone's goals and ideas into consideration when narrating the outcome?

I've certainly encountered the "I want to live" / "I want you to die" scenario. Like I said, at that point I mostly just step back and ask if the group collectively has some suggestions on how to make things non-binary. (Well, honestly I must admit I tend to be loose when setting stakes, which often means I have to rig narration to get everything to make sense. I keep telling myself I should be more strict with the stakes.)<br/><br/>Something I've heard suggested before is that the players can try to keep playing out the scene until appropriate non-binary stakes emerge, but I'm not sure that I've actually ever tried that. Maybe some people would prefer it, but to me it seems that just talking about it as a group would be faster and/or more fruitful.<br/><br/>That all is assuming that you can't differentiate stakes by focusing on the effect/intent question, like Jon illustrates above.<br/><br/>The "everyone loses" scenario can be frustrating, since sometimes there's no way to avoid it before hand. I generally find the way to deal with it is very situation specific. Sometimes, "everyone loses" means the conflict remains unresolved, and never will be. But since that can be unsatisfying or doesn't always make sense, more often "everyone loses" basically means a re-roll, maybe immediately or maybe at a later time, but preferably under slightly different circumstances and/or narration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201436/#Comment_201436" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-09T11:32:14+00:00" title="April  9, 2009 11:32AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh -- I was discussing this thread with another friend with whom I've played PTA, and he mentioned the same concerns, so there's definitely something to it.  There's more than one problem here so I'll do my best.<br/><br/>First of all, yeah, it's inherently hard for me to look over someone's shoulder at an AP and say "Dude it would have been awesome if that one guy there had just shot himself."  So take my specific examples with a pretty big grain of salt.<br/><br/>The flipside is that for a narrating player who is immersed in the game, this all becomes a lot easier.  They're swimming in the rich context of the game itself, so they're generally pretty plugged in about what's going to rock and what isn't.  Furthermore, PTA is really good about encouraging feedback between players.  If the narrator tries to pull something too crazy, there'll be enough groans and rolling eyes to warrant a second look.  If that fails, the rules fully support someone saying "Look, my character just isn't going to do that.  Try again."  So there are checks and balances here.<br/><br/>A lot of my advice here was informed by my own play experience, in which the absolute best parts were when I was really surprised by something my character ended up doing.  So I'm a bit more of an advocate for that style of play than some other people.<br/><br/>This is all a bit peripheral to the bigger issue of getting down to setting stakes, which is pretty much where the issue of binary conflicts arises out of.  I'm just going to flat out say that I'm pretty sure "My character wants your character dead" is going to be problematic.  I suggested one alternative, which was certainly on the extreme side of things, but there are other ways to handle it.<br/><br/>In retrospect, yeah, "actions not consequences" might not have been the most helpful way of phrasing things.  I'm still sort of feeling my way around some of this stuff.  I'll look through some of my own AP and see if I can find a good example of where we've either sailed around a binary conflict, or straight into it.<br/><br/>(This keeps popping into my mind, so I feel like I need to share, even though it's pretty tangential:  As another resolution, Grisha believes that he's shot and killed Misha.  But he hasn't; Misha's fine.  So now he's seeing a dead guy and not seeing a live guy.  The symmetry in that appeals to me.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201438/#Comment_201438" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-09T11:41:58+00:00" title="April  9, 2009 11:41AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>(This keeps popping into my mind, so I feel like I need to share, even though it's pretty tangential:  As another resolution, Grisha believes that he's shot and killed Misha.

I think its the same issue (seen through the lens of a different system) as discussed in <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9030&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow"> This recent Mouse Guard Thread </a> where two groups of mice had the same goal to kill the raven and if one won and the other lost, they couldn't both be true.  My suggestion there I think applies here as well...If both sides have the same goal, you're probably not drilling down far enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the stakes were either of the second two options (or something else similar) than that should be pretty straight forward to handle. You simply have to fill in each of the four boxes of the matrix plausibly (or rather the narrator does).<br/>\n<br/>\n"Misha wants to live", "Grisha wants 'Illya' to do the deed so he doesn't have to"?<br/>\nBoth Win: Misha survives, Grisha is convinced that Illya pulled the trigger...he may or may not realize Misha is still alive...after all he's already delusional, that's for the narrator to decide.<br/>\n<br/>\nMisha Wins:  Misha survives, Illya didn't do the deed.  Lots of possible interpretations there.  The most obvious is the Grisha realizes Illya "isn't real" and can't pull the trigger himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrisha Wins:  Misha's dead, Illya did it.  This one's pretty straight forward.  Grisha is saddened that Illya had to kill Misha.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth Lose:  Also pretty straightforward.  Misha's dead, Grisha's under no illusions who the trigger man was.<br/>\n<br/>\nor<br/>\n"Misha wants Grisha to come to his senses", "Grisha wants Misha dead?""<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth win:  Grisha comes to his senses, and kills Misha anyway<br/>\nMisha Wins:  Grisha comes to his senses, can't shoot Misha<br/>\nGrisha Wins:  Misha's dead and "Illya" killed him<br/>\nBoth lose:  Grisha's still delusional but Misha's not dead...possibly he survived the shooting, or possibly "Ilya" refused to do it "saying" Grisha had to do it himself and Grisha couldn't.  Again narrator's call.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's lots of possible ways to slice it.  Any will work as long as you can think of entertaining and plausible results for each of the 4 boxes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201451/#Comment_201451" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-09T12:58:50+00:00" title="April  9, 2009 12:58PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, this must be the second season of a series I remember enjoying some time back.
