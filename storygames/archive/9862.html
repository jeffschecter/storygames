They are certainly poorly written and badly organized, but if you sit down and read them through, you will find a completely playable and totally complete game.  Yes, there are points of ambiguity and gaps here and there you have to paper over, but they actually aren't that large.<br/><br/>That said, the attraction of S&amp;W (whether core or whitebox) is that they've done much of the cleaning up and organizing for you. However, there is stuff in the LBBs that *isn't* in S&amp;W, so it's still an interesting exercise to engage with them.  Stuff like explicit procedures for dungeoneering and wilderness adventures.  The latest version of S&amp;W core did add some of this stuff in, I'm not sure if S&amp;W whitebox has it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219288/#Comment_219288" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-18T09:40:59+00:00" title="July 18, 2009  9:40AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marshall Burns</cite>while OSRIC and Swords &amp; Wizardry are all about "having an adventure" or something, and import a bunch of unnecessary rules from later D&amp;D editions and supplements that dilute the dynamics of the original game.</blockquote>\nUm, that's a weird characterization.<br/><br/>First of all OSRIC is a straight repackaging of AD&amp;D1e: so not OD&amp;D at all.<br/><br/>S&amp;W Whitebox is a clean up of *just* the LBB rules. If it commits any sin, it is the sin of omission. As I mention above the LBB contain pretty explicit procedures for adventuring, much of which aren't included.<br/><br/>S&amp;W Core includes a few very judicious additions from Greyhawk: variable weapon damage, fast hit point progression, and more spells (hey, magic missle!). In the latest revision, they also added back a big chunk of those missing dungeoneering procedures (although not the wilderness adventure stuff).<br/><br/>So I would argue that S&amp;W gets you pretty dang close (I dunno what all this "having an adventure" stuff is about) to what Marshall is talking about.  The LBB do have a little more though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219488/#Comment_219488" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-19T17:29:22+00:00" title="July 19, 2009  5:29PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In defense of the "unplayability" of OD&amp;D, I can see where folks are coming from in denying that harsh label, since obviously several folks (myself included) are playing it just fine.

Also you had to figure out how to transport all the loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings like Long bows being super powerful, but hiring men who knew how to use them was expensive.  If you managed to take control of a castle you'd get that castle's knights in your warband.  They wouldn't cost anything but if they died they couldn't be replaced.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mention this because I think that game was rooted in the same spirit as all of those Henchman and Hirelings rules in the old games.

Its kind of the same thing now, as new retro-gamers with no connection to 1970's wargaming try to make sense of the text; and I think that's the context in which James was warning of OD&amp;D's unplayability. It really is a play experience best picked up by playing with an existing group, not by a cold reading of the text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
