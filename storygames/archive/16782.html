Yet). <br/><br/>For others, check out threads like this: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/222518" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/222518</a><br/>(unfortunately, my other shout outs to awesome artbooks are tucked in "Stuff to Watch (Month)" threads. If you do a search for +"parkablogs" in the search window, you'll see those threads.<br/><br/>Anyway, this latest salvo from parkablogs here, a visual guide to historic wear throughout the ages -- <a href="http://parkablogs.com/picture/auguste-racinet-costume-history" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://parkablogs.com/picture/auguste-racinet-costume-history</a> -- and wanting to blab about it here got me to finally creating a long-form ongoing thread where we talk about new or recently influential (to you) artbooks. Sort of an endless (?) Stuff to Watch thread for artbooks.<br/><br/><b>Why Artbooks?</b><br/><br/>So recently in education they're revising the "<b>Are you a visual/audio/tactile-kinesthetic learner?</b>" model, finding it to be not as useful as once imagined: However: What-evvaarrrr. I'm visual/tactile (mostly visual). It's led to setbacks in life, but opportunities as well (it's very hard for me to pick up info from reading computer manuals, but I can visually demonstrate through picture, model and metaphor complex technical ideas to technical and non-technical people). It's affected my hobby a huge amount: I've not ever really been entertained by reading pages of setting info, but seeing 1-2 really well drawn pictures usually flips my shit out and gets me on the right page. It wasn't the pages of text of Dark Sun and Planescape setting background that pulled me in, it was the art in Planes of Chaos (and the visual book that came with the core box, the 16-page thing for players) and The Veiled Alliance that got me into those settings big-time.<br/><br/>Cue artbooks. Books-of-art (fine art painting coffee table books) are not new. But this this I'm calling "artbooks" is pretty new. Landing somewhere between comic book, contemporary fine art compilation, video game manual, and contemporary studio/artist profile, these art books usually have works that can be very influential to gamers, particularly in terms of establishing setting. It's one thing to describe with wonder a series of upside-down temples hanging from a cliff face, and showing a picture of one taken from the Western Air Temple picture from the Avatar The Last Airbender artbook. ( <a href="http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/29300000/The-Western-Air-Temple-air-nomads-29368338-720-480.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/29300000/The-Western-Air-Temple-air-nomads-29368338-720-480.png</a> )<br/><br/>Or trying to roleplay a one-shot in a fabricated setting: "Sort of post-apocalypse. Basically, people came to this planet to find oil, and got a ton out of it. Then we found another, better resource, didn't need oil anymore, so left this planet as-is and moved on. So the world is kind of a post-apoc retro slummy scifi setting." ...yeah, or you could pass the book <b>KOLONIE</b> ( <a href="http://parkablogs.com/content/book-review-kolonie-forgotten-frontier" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://parkablogs.com/content/book-review-kolonie-forgotten-frontier</a> ) around the table, and in 5-10 minutes all five of your players are on the same page in terms of setting, and perhaps have been inspired for characters, equipment or kickers by some of the pictures.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">@Mark_Causey</a> loves the Persona (Shin Megami Tensei) setting of demon-summoning teenagers *almost* as much as I'm obsessed with the Final Fantasy X setting. He ran a game of Archipelago II for a table of people who were interested, but never played the games. Folly, right? Normally, yes. But with a quick 5 minute introduction (which would have been a longer 20+ minutes and boring without the books) he also passed around two artbooks/Visual Guides to the games/setting. Five minutes later, everyone was on the same page and diving in. Mark said it was the closest RPG experience to the game/setting he's done to date; and this was a table full of people who had never played the game before.<br/><br/>So that's my advocacy blurb, and the starting post to this ongoing thread. <br/><br/>Post about art books that you found inspirational, and please post:<br/>* At least a little about it (even if you haven't bought it yet and are just reading a parkablogs or other review). What you like about it, etc.<br/>* Stuff you might use it for in relation to gaming (particularly important if you haven't bought it/used it yet, to discuss what it <b>might</b> be used for)<br/>* If applicable, if you've actually used it at the table, what the book brought to the table.<br/><br/><b>NOTE:</b> Art *sites*, like Art of Animation ( <a href="http://theartofanimation.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://theartofanimation.tumblr.com/</a> ) and visual design *sites* like Francesco Mugnai ( <a href="http://blogof.francescomugnai.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://blogof.francescomugnai.com/</a> ) are indeed awesome, but if we linked to "pictures we liked" we'd never end. This thread is for <b>art books</b>, not just awesome pictures on the net. Thanks!<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
