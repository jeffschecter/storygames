                    I had a dream last night in which a group of people tried to teach me a game. The game was called Tengu. There were five or six people playing and a bunch of people around them watching. They would take turns rolling dice and making up stories from the dice. The dice were regular six sided. There were chips that were used for keeping score and betting whether the player would "hit his mark", which involves getting all of the dice accounted for in the time allotted. It went something like this. The guy at the head of the table picks up a bunch of dice (like 6 to 10 he had them cupped in his hand) he shakes them up and someone turns over an egg timer (a little one three minutes) then the guy arranges the dice. He sets them up in a line and begins to narrate. He had six minutes to make a chapter of his story. Then the next player would do the same thing. And so on around the table.<br/>
<br/>
 The only rule I know for sure is that the story had turn-arounds, which followed the dice. A 1-3 was bad thing that happened to the character in the story, and 4-6 was a good thing. A 1 was something worse than a 2 or 3 and a 6 was similarly better than a 4 or 5. So if there was a roll of 1 2 2 4 4 4 5 5 6, there would be one really bad thing happen two failures five good things and one really good thing in that chapter (I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember anyone calling them chapters but that is how I have come to think of them). There are points scored for bringing things into your story and using them later in another chapter. These were recorded with chips there were also points for incorporating stuff from other stories. This would be a sort of fortune in the front thing and the player would be rewarded for coming up with conflicts and resolutions matching what the dice rolled.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The player would start his story, "There was a guy named Joe. He was an Itinerant records salesman (this is not the story from the dream, I came in to the middle). Joe came to a new town and, like he always did he took his sample records and his portable record player and scouted out the high street.  But on his way to the high street, he runs into a gang of punk kids who surround him (one of the 2s). Joe is frightened of them, but starts to if their parents might want to buy some records and one of the kids pushes the records out from under his arm from behind. Startled Joe turns around and uses the momentum in the phonograph to clock the kid (one of the 4s). The kids scatter and Joe picks up his records and trudges off to a bar to take a drink "to calm his nerves"(another 2). Joe has had a problem with alcohol on and off heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lost jobs to it but he is trying to quit. He reaches for the door to the bar and pulls it open. As he pulls the door open he says to himself, " No! I need this job (another 4). He starts to let the handle go but the door keeps opening and there coming out of the bar Joe stands face to face with the father who left him and his mother 10 years ago (the 1)Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and so on.<br/>
<br/>
The person who has the most points at the end is the winner.  There was also a rule that if you couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come up with something you could call "Line". The people around, whether they were playing or not, would shout out suggestions and the player would pay a chip and take one of the suggestions. <br/>
<br/>
The images that have stuck with me are the people standing around laughing and clapping for the stories, the guy rolling the dice and lining them up. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know if it would work the way I have remembered it, but I want people to clap for my stories.<br/>
<br/>
I want to play this game. The only part I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know is the scoring.  I was thinking you would get:<br/>
1 chip for every dice you used (this doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem like it would make people clap for big numbers of dice but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what I can come up with)<br/>
1 for every thing tied in to someone elseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story<br/>
2 for every item or character, that you re-incorporate from an earlier chapter<br/>
If you hit your mark you get 3 times the number of dice you used in chips<br/>
<br/>
It cost:<br/>
1 chip to bring in a new character/object   (but free in a chapter part detailed from a 1 or a 6)<br/>
1 chip to buy a "Line"<br/>
3 chips to change a dice to some other number <br/>
If you miss your mark or run over your allotted time, there is a penalty of 2 chips for every dice unused<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who want to interpret the dream:<br/>
<br/>
-I joined a new gaming group recently and they taught me to play Dogs in the Vineyard (which has the sort of dice rolling and push dice nar in the dream). <br/>
- I have read, but not played Universalis.<br/>
-I have read Keith JohnstoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Impro.<br/>
-I have felt a little jealous reading about the cool gaming get-togethers in Chicago and Virginia.<br/>
-I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what Tengu meant till I googled it this morning. It is a Japanese spirit that slays vanity. In the dream I thought it was Nepalese. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know if that has meaning but the name is cool enough for me.<br/>
<br/>
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure all of these things were responsible for the dream coming out the way it did, but that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really matter. If you can think of anything that would make this a better game I would love to hear about it, especially the betting part of the dream which I have not come up with anything for. I will be getting Impro out of the library to reread the passages on story creation to see if there is anything in there which would help. I made the scoring up whole cloth, so it can be changed completely, I feel less sanguine about changing the other parts. I want to see if it works like in the dream.                </div>

                            That's really cool, Thor.  I sometimes get notional game mechanics or solutions to mechanical problems in my dreams, too.                        </div>
