Plus, a lot of the games I like to play have a semi-GM or not-really GM (like, uh, <i>Bliss Stage</i>), so I'm not sure if it's kosher to bring + pitch them.

The goal is for gmless, one-shot, no-prep games, but I haven't heard that broadcast recently. No one said boo to me when I pitched Monsterhearts or My Daughter the Queen of France. Similarly, no one would be too ticked if I put out a one time message saying to bring mixes for Ribbon Drive (there-by breaking the no-prep rule a little). I also think I might be able to get away with doing a second session of a particularly interesting Polaris game if the same people showed up (breaking the one-shot rule). <br/><br/>You can think of the justifications for having the no-prep, one-shot, gm-less rules, right? Each helps when playing with a bunch of strangers week after week. But these rules are based on previous experience, they aren't commandments and the same judgement that placed them allows them to be bent slightly and temporarily.<br/><br/>At the Story Games meetup in Olympia, we play MonsterHearts and Apocalypse World all the time. Eventually, we crave a long form version, and we set it up for outside the regular meetups where we can focus on playing with strangers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371988/#Comment_371988" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T15:19:38+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  3:19PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Ben's rule isn't "no GM's" - it's "no multi-session campaigns."

I co-ran SGBoston for three years, so I totally dig the pick-up games vibe. We just didn't do GMless pick-up games that much (because they mostly didn't exist back then; that's why I wrote Geiger Counter!), but I get one-shots, definitely.  We didn't do no-prep either, but I can kinda see the reasoning behind that (i.e. it's no big deal if nobody wants to play your game that week, since you didn't put a ton of work in). What does that mean for playtesting, though? That's a whole ton of prep, yeah? (writing a playtest draft). Nobody ever guilts people into their game with that? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><b>Jamie:</b> Yeah, I really like "no assumption of multiple sessions, but if everyone shows up next week and wants to play again, cool."

Don't write your character backstory ahead of time, etc. Obvs a facilitator has to prep a little; they have to remember the book and maybe print a couple things. But if the facilitator starts playing before everyone gets there (writes a bunch of the story for us)... you can see why you'd want to discourage that. Certain things might have to be pre-gen to make a one-shot feasible, but the rule exists to put gentle pressure against that type of thing. <br/><br/>As for play-testing, at the Story Games <i>Olympia</i> meetup, we have one Thursday a month for playing playtest versions of games. Just like all the other rules, we've broken it a few times for good reasons (we need to playtest the Selkie for example) but we try to honor the spirit that the rule was made up for: we are trying to play games with strangers and those strangers will (very generally) have a better time playing a finished game. I don't know what the playtest rule is at Story Games Seattle, but I imagine that you'd have to pitch it just like anything else, and then folks would be warned that it was a playtest. Then they can choose to play that or something else that it pitched. (This is good training for pitching your game and isolating what is attractive about it to others). <br/><br/>I know Kingdom has been playtested a lot by Story Games Seattle folks. They might chime in.<br/><br/><br/>edited to add Olympia.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372022/#Comment_372022" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T18:43:30+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  6:43PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2012 6:44PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For months, people have asked me privately to post something explaining the success of Story Games Seattle, our methods, etc. I've been woefully slow in doing so, because I've been busy with things like cons and Kingdom. But I should really get around to it. The questions you're asking Jonathan are directly a part of that. What Morgan and Jamie are saying is dead on.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mathalus</cite>As for play-testing, at the Story Games meetup, we have one Thursday a month for playing playtest versions of games.</blockquote>\nLest there be confusion, Morgan is talking about Story Games Olympia.\n<blockquote>I know Kingdom has been playtested a lot by Story Games Seattle folks.</blockquote>\nNot at meetups. We scheduled outside games. Same with Microscope: it was never played Story Games Seattle until it had been playtested a zillion times.<br/><br/>The rule at Story Games Seattle is pitch no playtests unless it has already been substantially playtested and is already well towards done. People are showing up who have never gamed before and it is not the time or place to try to explain what they may or may not be getting into by trying an unfinished game. Story Games Olympia's solution of having a designated "playtest" meetup is very smart.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mathalus</cite>In my mind, no prep means don't play before you play.

"Prep" means making the fiction before you get to the table, playing before you play as Morgan very accurately puts it. Printing out rules or studying them so you can teach is not what we're talking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MummyKitty" title="MummyKitty"><img alt="MummyKitty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/582/nF6IT7RM67QPV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MummyKitty">MummyKitty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372480/#Comment_372480" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T21:25:07+00:00" title="April 11, 2012  9:25PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @Mathalus, thanks for the clue about the east side meet up!
