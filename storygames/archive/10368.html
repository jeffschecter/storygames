That's sort of a start:<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5063" rel="nofollow">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5063</a><br/><br/>I'll scrounge up the PDF for you and post it up. Not that it's a good game, or even a mediocre game. It totally doesn't function as-is. But you don't need to take my word for it.<br/><br/>Anyway, to tell the story: a couple months after GenCon 2007 (when it was at the Ashcan Front), I was working on trying to solve the inherent problems in the game. That's when, after several conversations with Lenny Balsera about the game, he said "Dude, you need to shelve this for a bit and make a game about killing orcs or something."<br/><br/>From that line was born Mythender. (Well, from that and a half-dozen other things poking me in that direction anyway.)<br/><br/>But, beyond that, a couple months later I was playing more of Paul's Penny, and after giving him a crapton of feedback (and since we chat frequently, was easy to go further into said feedback), he offered me the job of editing it. In many ways, Penny was the amnesia game I wanted, more than Know Thyself. Working with Paul on Penny meant I didn't need to make KT. My lust for creating an amnesia game was sated by helping my friend make his ninja-badass.<br/><br/>Then earlier this year, when I realized the fundamental flaw on which the rest of the game breaks: Know Thyself would work a shitton better if the central character (as it's a one-PC/many-GM game) actually *thought* he knew himself, rather than know nothing. I haven't talked about this at all online until now, and much with anyone other than I think Lenny &amp; Paul. But it's on my "well, after Dresden. And Mythender. And the other five books I'm working on" back burner.<br/><br/>So, it's not in development right now. It is dead. But from its ashes something else may rise. Something more akin to psychological horror of discovering who you are behind the lies you believe, or something like that, mixed with a psychotropic play environment. (And, well, I was cutting my teeth on KT. When I come back to it, whatever it is will actually work.)<br/><br/>And my friend Jerry did badass photography for the custom desk. That *is* online:<br/><a href="http://tomorrowtheworldgames.com/knowthyself/ashcan/cards/" rel="nofollow">http://tomorrowtheworldgames.com/knowthyself/ashcan/cards/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230923/#Comment_230923" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-09T14:31:49+00:00" title="September  9, 2009  2:31PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, Ryan. Thanks for the story. I agree that Penny is totally badass, so thanks for your hand in that. Hopefully Mythender will come out all shiny (still sad I didn't get a chance to play it at GPNW, but the Upgrade rocked)!<br/><br/>Also, this seems like a good place to say: I'm working on a GC09 entry, and Master Plan is really incredibly helpful, both in ideas, and, more importantly, encouragement. I thought your "I believe...!" statement was a bit cheesy when I first listened, but now it actually makes me feel encouraged.
