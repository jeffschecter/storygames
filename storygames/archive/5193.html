Help a brother out!<br/><br/>So this thread is not about playing RPGs with different languages.<br/><br/>It's about ways to explore language perhaps in a fantasy setting, and things that we could do to make the process of language more interesting.<br/><br/>For example, my D&amp;D character can speak Human, Elven, and Abyssal.<br/>My Shadowrun character presumably speaks Japanese and Portugese, with some English.<br/><br/>Normally, in games, this means:<br/><br/>GM: There is writing on the wall in Dwarven. Does anyone have that language?<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>GM: There are two people in the corner speaking quietly. Can anyone's character speak French?<br/><br/>With the usual success and failure conditions. If you have that right language that just happens to fit the adventure, a metaphorical doorway opens. Otherwise, it remains closed and blocked. So, traditionally, as a player I tend to choose "Common" and nothing else (cause it's too easy to pick the "wrong language for the adventure/mcguffin" unless languages are free or are defined by my character's background. As a GM, I never really have characters speak foreign languages unless they are doing so to enhance the mystique of speaking a language no one understands, or unless I see that someone took "Halfling" and I want to throw them a bone for choosing it.<br/><br/>So what can we do to make languages more exciting?  Specifically:<br/><br/>1) What can we do in play to make different languages interesting?<br/><br/>2) As a GM, what way can we use them other than a "you have it or you don't" switch for puzzles and secret info and stuff?<br/><br/>3) What can we do to encourage players to choose different languages, without fear of choosing the "wrong one"? <br/>-- (obvious fix: If your CoC explorer has "Farsi" written on her sheet, then by God have Iranian artifacts in the game. But aside from that, what else is there?)<br/><br/>Looking for creative suggestions, an exploration of how to make language and language choices fun and interesting in a game, be it D&amp;D or Transhuman Space.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117298/#Comment_117298" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-01T09:50:49+00:00" title="January  1, 2008  9:50AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 1, 2008 9:51AM by chearns.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>3) What can we do to encourage players to choose different languages, without fear of choosing the "wrong one"?</blockquote>\nWell, could it be done in reverse? <br/><br/>Like, instead of saying, my character knows Human, Elvish, and Abyssal, now throw me a bone, could it be my character knows Human and two other languages, and then, if there's writing on the wall in Dwarven, or there are two people in the corner speaking quietly, the players could determine if they want to spend their slots on the language or not, depending on how badly they want the information. <br/><br/>For example, if the Dwarven writing is happening in a segment that has nothing to do with my characters goals, then screw it, I don't know Dwarven, let whoever wants that information burn one of their slots. But, if those two people in the corner are tied in to who killed my siblings, then you bet I can speak the language.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117299/#Comment_117299" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-01T09:56:37+00:00" title="January  1, 2008  9:56AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris, that's how it works in Gumshoe, actually.

"Oh really?"<br/><br/>Except you wouldn't have to arbitrarily restrict it along those categories: You could be the soldier who happens to have picked the secret language of turtles in his childhood, or such. Or the thief who picks up the language of shadows to aid him in his profession. "Darkness, cloak my passage!" "What's in it for me?"

Its not just knowing or not knowing. We generally have three different vocabularies. There's language we can understand when we hear it, there's language we can use in speech, and there's language that we can write. They're not the same thing and people aren't equally good at them.<br/><br/>Also, often a word or phrase can have two or more meanings, giving you a different translation depending upon the choices you make in deciphering the information. I think a lot more could be made of the potential for sensible but erroneous readings. You might think you completely understood and be completely wrong.

On one hand, the setup firmly places the PCs as strangers in a strange land.  They don't speak the language of the people in this land natively -- so, at best, they speak it as a second language, and at worst there's no common language between the PCs and all the NPCs.<br/><br/>I'm planning on suggesting one of two ways to tackle this:<br/>1. Don't worry about it.  Just like in many sci-fi shows, everyone speaks the same language, perhaps with some colorful words that highlight culture.  (Currently, I'm using "S\xfcdlander" for foreigner -- literally "south-lander" in German.  That'll have to change as I find a more appropriate word.)<br/>2. Play up the language barrier...uh, somehow.  Yeah.  Somehow.

Then let the players roll their language skills to determine what language it's written in, not whether they understand it or not, but rather they get to decide which language it is with a successful roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117443/#Comment_117443" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-02T09:12:26+00:00" title="January  2, 2008  9:12AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>2.

Example: 13th Warrior -- Antonio's character becomes more accepted among the barbarians as he picks up their language. Another example would be any case in which a subgroup identifies itself by its jargon -- if you can drop the appropriate jargon, you gain access to that group.<br/><br/>* Language as understanding: Some story facts may simply be inaccessible without a matching language. I'd assume this would fall into stuff like social relationships (X owes Y something, which you can't know w/o speaking the language), language-triggered effects (magic, voice-activated technologies, memes that don't translate correctly, psychic constructs that work only in certain languages).<br/><br/>* Language as obfuscation: Perhaps you can turn language into an offensive tool, a way to hide your intent. If you're not talking, the guy checking you out will have to resort to his own observation of you: You're carrying a sword and your shirt's covered in blood, I'll bet you're the murderer! But if you can speak the language (and/or use the jargon), then you could actually bypass objective observation and impose a <i>subjective perception</i> onto a target.<br/><br/>* In Actual Play, I've always enjoyed providing unreliability of information due to partial understanding of language. This might be as subtle as not understanding nuances, or as hardcore as simply misreading "left" for "right".<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117676/#Comment_117676" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-03T10:27:00+00:00" title="January  3, 2008 10:27AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The two ways in which I could see language being used in a game in a more interesting manner:<br/><br/>1) Assign spells/special abilties to having the language.<br/><br/>Obviously, Clinton kicked open the door with Zu on that, but you also see it in one of the D&amp;D magic supplements as a separate form of magic.   But- let's take that a step further- what if only certain spells can be cast in certain languages?   For example, Protection against Evil requires knowing Celestial?  Then languages become this fascinating stepping stone to making strategic choices and a way of dividing up spells into groups so that no one can have a full range.<br/><br/>2) Cultural markers<br/><br/>As Ryan points out- not knowing a language, or speaking it poorly, can simply mark you as an outsider.  <br/><br/>But let's take it from foreign situations to simply current living situations.  There's a whole lot of politics about whether you speak a second language in the US.   And it swings from whether you're marked as an outsider to even how folks in your own group might consider you.

It's about jokes, camaraderie, insults and threats. It can be used to discuss any topic except the health, well-being, mental state of, or concern for a superior.<br/><br/>Polite language is the default mode of speech. <br/><br/>Respectful language is used to speak to superiors. When using it, a character may not refer to himself or his own needs; also, the character may not curse, utter profanities or speak in anger or harsh tones.<br/><br/>Humble language is used when the speaker is attempting to aid or help the recipient of the speech. When using it, the speaker cannot claim credit for an action, boast or brag, or speak in anger.<br/><br/>Rules-wise, when entering into a conversation with someone, either side has the ability to call for an Etiquette test in order to set the level of language appropriate for the interaction, with the caveat that someone who is of lower rank, even when victorious in the Etiquette test, may not choose to set the level of speech lower than polite.<br/><br/>Once the level of language is set, breaking the conventions incurs a +2 Ob to the social skill test he is roleplaying. <br/><br/>Alternatively, the winner of the Etiquette test may choose to set the level of language to Verse. If you choose to take a conversation to Verse, you can ignore the speech constraints. However, violence and war are frowned upon as poetic topics and inclusion of such would be justification for a Disadvantage.<br/><br/>The rules are pretty simple, but they create some very cool effects in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117744/#Comment_117744" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-03T12:36:32+00:00" title="January  3, 2008 12:36PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>1) What can we do in play to make different languages interesting?</blockquote>\n<a href="http://wso.williams.edu/~msulliva/campaigns/munchkins/" rel="nofollow">Munchkins</a>.

Check out Paul B's suggestions, they are gold.<br/><br/>While it's rules-wise, you could take a look at the use of language in Burning Wheel's Blossoms are Falling. There are different levels of language that can be used in a Duel of Wits - informal, formal, poetry, etc - and each one restricts what can be said. So you can maybe convey the same information using different styles of language, but the way you do it is different in each.<br/><br/>These are all dialect versions within a larger language, but the concept can be used between languages as well. The better you know a language, the more complex you can make your communications, the more complex the ideas you can impart. And of course, the better you know a language, the better you understand that society, because their social structure and their ideas about the world are all present in their language. Nowadays, you can learn a language through audio recordings and movies. In Ye Olden Days, you'd have to learn it from somebody else, and so you would learn about them along with their language.<br/><br/>EDIT: Crossposted with Thor, who beat me to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117753/#Comment_117753" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-03T12:44:54+00:00" title="January  3, 2008 12:44PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thor, this language system sounds very intriguing!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117756/#Comment_117756" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-03T12:52:23+00:00" title="January  3, 2008 12:52PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite>There's a whole lot of politics about whether you speak a second language in the US.</blockquote>\nCould you please elaborate on that? Not being in the US I don't really get what you mean.<br/><br/>I think the idea behind that is learning another language is like admitting the inferiority of your own (my interpretation). Also, English has been so dominant in America, and America has been so isolationist for much of its history, that many people see no need to learn a second language. Americans have never had any reason to doubt that their language is not the superior, dominant language. In Europe, only France can come close to the same experience.<br/><br/>Here's an example from academia: Middle Eastern Studies.<br/>It used to be that if you wanted to study the middle east, the first thing you would do is learn Arabic. Obvious, right? Nowadays, knowing Arabic can actually be detrimental to your academic prestige, as you may be seen as an "Orientalist" or even some kind of sympathizer. Nevermind you can't get any first-hand info from the middle east without Arabic...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117773/#Comment_117773" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-03T13:19:38+00:00" title="January  3, 2008  1:19PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Understood.<br/>Dude... you've got issues <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Learning another language is seen as a big plus in italy.

Let me explain a bit more.<br/><br/>French used to be the most prestigious language in Europe. Educated people all over learned French. For a Russian aristocrat to speak Russian to another Russian aristocrat was an insult, because it was a peasant's language. They would speak French. This situation lasted a long, long time, pretty much picking up from when educated people all spoke Latin, and trailed off when the British Empire and the US came to dominate the world economically and culturally.<br/><br/>So if you grew up learning proper French in this period, why would you want to learn another language? After all, anybody worth talking to speaks French! A slight exaggeration, of course, but that's the mindset. All the other countries in Europe can remember a time when somebody else's language was more important than their own, usually several levels of other languages. In Italy, for example, you have lots of regional dialects (like piedmontese), and then old Latin was replaced by the Florentine dialect, which became the model for modern "Italian" and then the French and the Austrians and the Spanish all conquered sections of Italy, and French was important world-wide, and then English, later. So it is not surprising that Italians (or most Europeans, really) would see the utility in speaking multiple languages.<br/><br/>The British ushered in the age of English dominance. But they could (and can) still remember when somebody else's language was king. Even at the height of empire, knowing French (and Latin, and Greek) was an important part of an English education.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117806/#Comment_117806" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-03T14:54:59+00:00" title="January  3, 2008  2:54PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The US, on the other hand, has pretty much been able to lord it over everybody from the beginning. There were a lot of Germans in the early colonists, but the new American government decided that English would be the official language.<br/><br/>After that, they colonized the Indians, stole territory from Mexico and Spain, swindled territory out of France and Russia, and basically prevented non-English culture from flourishing. New immigrants came from all over, but were quickly anglicized. Nothing like Quebec in the US.<br/><br/>They didn't like tromping around in the world, either, and when they did - it was on their own terms. Alliances and treaties for both world wars were conducted in English - at Versailles (for WWI) Clemenceau and Vittorio spoke English (and the Japanese delegates didn't speak much at all). After WWII, you've got Roosevelt and Churchill, with Stalin using an interpreter.<br/><br/>American education has traditionally played down anything foreign. You learn about America, and not really other countries. In my dad's time, anyway, I don't know if it's better now. I was educated in Canada.<br/><br/>So it's only now that the US is really experiencing a decline in power, an influx of other languages, the fact that knowing multiple languages is damn useful, etc etc. And it's not having the best time of it, especially given the long history of racial/cultural tension in the US.<br/><br/>Is it fucked up?

In the US, it becomes focused on what your "first" language is, as the source of identity.  If you speak English, then learn another language, good for you!  If you speak something else, then learn English, you're a foreigner... even if you can trace back your family history more than 8 generations in this country.  <br/><br/>For interesting stuff, try looking at the tensions around Spanish, French, Creole, Gullah, any recent immigrant group or any indigenous languages in the US.<br/><br/>Think of it this way- if speaking one way marks you as superior, inferior, native or alien, it says a lot about the area and the people you're dealing with.

Johnstone's word have been sparking lots of thought about language in game settings, just like Andy was asking.<br/><br/>Interesting Language Use 1: The Language of the Empire<br/><br/>In this setting there is some kind of superpower (generally an Empire, or something similar) that shares a language (think Latin in the Roman empire). If your character is not a native "imperial" speaker he will be percieved as foreigner and inferior by imperial people (independently from his social status). Also, various degree of fluency in the imperial language will influence the reactions in "social combat" situations.<br/><br/>Interesting Language Use 2: The Language of the Arts. <br/><br/>This mimics 1700 europe: each broad subject of conversation in high class circles has a language attached. Art and Music is discussed in Italian, Romance and Politics in French, Science and Philosophy in Latin, business in English, Diplomacy in German (or something like that: change according to your setting and taste). Now, you need proficiency in many languages to be a real social monkey: discussing of a subject in the wrong language is seen as uncouth and inefficient, and not only can give you minuses to your rolls, but could even cause miscommunications, since some languages lack the correct words for some subjects!<br/><br/>Interesting stuff <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117934/#Comment_117934" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-04T09:07:43+00:00" title="January  4, 2008  9:07AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2008 9:14AM by Larry.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used to be more interested in this issue. Games like GURPS and Hero even have tables for linguistically similar languages costing less points or whatever. But at some point I guess I realized that a) the necessary level of exploration of the many subtle things which make language cool for me, and b) keeping handling time low enough to actually be fun to use in a game, were mutually exclusive goals. It always seems way cooler on paper than it turns out in play.<br/><br/>I should point out that in a sufficiently abstract conflict resolution system you could, just like any other skill, have a given language  (Mountain Folk tongue 2d8, New Pelorian 12w1) and use it to get your desired outcome in an appropriate situation. Instead of treating language as a communications blocker, you could treat it like any other social skill or cultural affinity. So if you don't have the right language skill, you can still maybe communicate if you can narrate a rationale for it. ("Using 'Expressive gestures,' I point and grunt at the stranger until he gets a rough understanding of the object we're looking for.") Having the language skill just gives you an obvious option.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118264/#Comment_118264" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-07T08:30:21+00:00" title="January  7, 2008  8:30AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While it was a big thread-drift, the discussion about the social ramifications of knowing a second language in the US contains a GREAT idea for use of language, in particular with other applications of it mentioned above:<br/>* Designate some languages as "socially stigmatizing" (Orcish or Demonic) and others as "socially promoting" (Elvish or in politics or arts; Gnomish and Dwarvish in sciences).<br/>* Socially stigmatizing languages could, in turn, be attached to spell use (per above) or be required for some guild entries (Mages, Thieves), or some-such. Thus, there's a push-pull of desire to know a "verboten" language versus hiding that knowledge.<br/>* Socially promoting languages might be requisite in certain guilds (Tinker's, Mining, Masons) or situations (at court, church, or theater). Thus, there's a stimulus to gain languages one might otherwise skip in favor of languages with more immediate benefits (like learning a bunch of monster's tongues to be able to deal with/persuade/con them).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119097/#Comment_119097" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-11T03:56:00+00:00" title="January 11, 2008  3:56AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my last but one big campaign I created a chart showing how all the setting's languages, living and dead, were related to one another, with the most obscure languages being far down the line at the root of many branches, and the tips being diverse but current tongues. This meant that I could introduce languages the characters had never seen before, and they could still attempt to read them based on recognizing similarities to things they did know.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I could say "The book is written in a script you do not recognize, you have never seen it before, but it *is* a little like the texts you have been studying in New Hrkun. You suspect that it might be Old Hrkun, or even a dialect of Tenebrian". (In fact it seems I still have the chart online <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.teuton.org/~stranger/Tanaloth/Encyclopedia/L.html#Languages" rel="nofollow">here</a>).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing was, as David suggests above, all but the most current languages were totally stigmatized, languages of a now dead and hated Empire that the new religion taught were all devil worshippers. That meant that, apart from approved and holy blessings, all magic appeared in these ancient and forbidden languages .. and they were also what monsters spoke. So knowing them was very valuable, but also very suspect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley" title="Jack Aidley"><img alt="Jack Aidley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley">Jack Aidley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119105/#Comment_119105" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-11T06:53:55+00:00" title="January 11, 2008  6:53AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Riffing off Larry, you could abstract social skills to being entirely language based so that rather than having:<br><br>Diplomacy 2d8, Fluent English, Intermediate French, Basic Spanish<br><br>You'd have<br/><br/>English 2d8, French d8, Spanish d4.<br/><br/>And when rolling to bargain, cajole, seduce, negotiate, whatever, you roll your language skill.

The subject is one that I've studied some, and am fascinated by (being a Toliken fanboy, dontchaknow). And excuse me, I'm about to get long and perhaps rambly. In fact I think I just realized that my loquacious and rambly style probably comes from my idolization of writers like Tolkien and William F. Buckley Jr. Hmmm...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider that even in everyday use of your best known language with other competent users of that language, that problems in interpretation occur. In fact, the science of communication tells us that it's not really a question of binary understanding of one another, but every attempt at communication is just a question of how badly it went. If you take my meaning. No communication is perfect, and most is seriously flawed in one or more ways. <br/>\n<br/>\nConsider, for example, that often we as speakers aren't really even sure what it is that we're trying to communicate. Our idea may not be well formed. Then there's the attempt to put it into words, which often fails to some extent. Then there's the attempt by the reader to obtain from the words transmitted the meaning. Which can be foiled not only by a lack of conveyed meaning from the broadcaster, but also by simple mechanical problems with hearing and other various impediments. How often have you listened to somebody and not really made out some word that you heard, and not asked for clarification for whatever reason, instead trying to discern the meaning of the sentence from it's incomplete context? <br/>\n<br/>\nThese sorts of things happen constantly, and, again, that assumes two "native" speakers. <br/>\n<br/>\nA real question with any language is whether or not the user actually thinks in the language. I can speak Spanish... badly. When speaking the language, I must always think in English, and then recall what the translation is, and then attempt to speak it. This extra step causes no end of trouble in terms of getting the communication across well. One generally becomes proficient in a language by starting with common phrases and can begin to "simulate" thinking in the language by using these. For instance, I'm fond of saying, "Mi Espanol es muy mal." Trans: My Spanish is very bad. But past this I have to go very slooooowly. <br/>\n<br/>\nEfficient use of a language is all about how quickly you can get an idea across, as well as how accurately. If you're slow and deliberate, you can often make yourself understood by taking a lot of time. Often, however either the transmitter or the reciever doesn't have the patience. I am reminded of a cab ride I had in Paris once where my wife spoke very little French, and the cabbie was from Spain, and spoke French as a "second language." We were unable to communicate at all that way. Using Spanish, of which both me and my wife speak a little, we were able to get a few phrases across, but couldn't really get the idea of where we needed to go. Fortunately we had an address, and the driver got us there... but the ride cost us $50 US in 1990. Our lack of skill in his languages offended him I think. In any case he certainly didn't have the patience to try to figure out what we were saying in our badly mangled version of his language. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in fact, I think that language use is entirely a social skill. Treating it as such is completely "realistic." In face language can be thought of as "The" social skill. Almost all other social skills are subsets of it. If you cannot communicate well, you cannot be socially apt in almost any other way (raw physical atraction, perhaps, aside). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course Larry saw me coming and mentioned language in Heroquest. That game is interesting in that the cultures of Glorantha are very "bronze age" especially in one very important way - members tend to speak one language, unique to the culture, and no others. Now that's not to say that many PCs in that game aren't exceptional and travelers who have learned other languages... its a common and trivial thing to add a language to your charcter sheet. Better yet, what often happens is that we'll reel forward in time a week in the new land, and players will spend one Hero Point and purchase the local language at the beginning level (13). Which represents a crash immersion course in the language. Or they'll even begin play with that language, under the assumption that they arrived there a while ago, and are sensible enough people to have aquired a smattering of the tongue. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that always fascinated me about Conan is that he was not some dumb brute in the books, but quite a capable linquist who picked up the local langage wherever he roamed. I think that this solves quite a lot of the potential for communication problems. In fact, when we incorporate a new PC into play in a place, and he's not a local, I ask first, "Why has your character come to this place?" And in the answer we'll find the reason for the character having taken the time to learn the language. How can a character desire to be a merchant or do diplomacy in a region if he hasn't taken some time to learn the local language? <br/>\n<br/>\nSo any good system that allows retroactive purchase of abilities tends to handle languages just fine. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I say that because the obvious problem with language is what happens if the characters encounter others, and have no language in common between them. The results are as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119169/#Comment_119169" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-11T12:46:19+00:00" title="January 11, 2008 12:46PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...from above.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. You allow no communication beyond sign-language and such obvious things as body language and expression. The problem here is that usually NPCs exist in order to deliver information to keep the game moving. Sometimes language isn't neccessary in this. For instance, I have a scenario in which PCs encounter cruel slavers, and, assuming that they free the slaves (I haven't seen them fail to do so yet), the slaves don't speak their language neccessarily. But the slaves make it clear that they want to follow the PCs, not knowing their way in the desert in which the encounter occurs. But if the information is more complex, then this may not suffice. Over time, you're going to want the NPCs to be able to speak. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. You ignore the problem. Which takes one of three sub-forms, generally:<br/>\n  A. You assume that everyone speaks the same langage in the world. Not very realistic, but simple, and internally consistent. <br/>\n  B. You have a "Common" language that everyone speaks. This at times may seem implausible, yet even Tolkien uses it, and there are some real-life examples. The term Linga Franca applies here. It should be noted that, realistically, "common" languages tend to be the language of one dominant culture that has made it's use profitable for many to use (or even has forced its use on an empire). <br/>\n  C. You assume a "babelfish" solution, meaning that there exists some magic or technology like the babelfish from the Hitch-hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Adams comments about the existence of the babelfish proving that there is no God, are actually a subtle commentary on the fact that this is an obvious plot device meant to keep the action from revolving around issues of language. <br/>\n<br/>\n3. The D&amp;D solution mentioned by Justin... you have characters all know so many languages that somebody will know the one needed in all likelihood. This has several drawbacks, however. <br/>\n  A. It makes it a cultural assumption for all cultures that they are massively multi-lingual. I don't know about you, but I don't find that to be particularly plausible. Again, even Tolkien had his characters knowing multiple languages, sure. But they were supposed to be exceptional in this. Samwise doesn't know anything but his rustic version of Westron. Frodo does, but he's wealthy and educated. <br/>\n  B. Worse, it assumes that there's only one human language, largely, as if all humans are from one nation. This is, in fact, embedded in the World of Greyhawk where "common" is supposedly the result of the vast majority of the map having been once under the sway of a single great empire. Possibly plausible, but even in the Roman empire nobody spoke Latin as their primary language outside of Rome. Yes, Oerth has other languages, but even these tend to be racially aligned instead of the more realistic cultural alignment, and seem to be spoken second after common. Put another way, in the real world, there are a lot of languages, and even Tolkien is working under the assumption that the area in question really only has the one human culture (Numenorean, for lack of a better unifying term). The orcs certainly have their own language, and speak Westron pretty much as a plot device as a second language. We would assume that the Easterlings have their own languages, too. So <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that all of these solutions has drawbacks in certain situations. This is why langage is such a bugaboo in RPGs. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's because, frankly, usually langage is not meant to be central to play. As a corrolary to Renato's point, don't make language central by putting specialized mechanics on it, unless you really do want it to be central. That is, despite my reservations about the methods above to deal with the potential problems of language barrier, I'm for them if you really don't want the game to devolve into some discussion about language and it's effects, itself. Which I think could be dread dull, especially if undirected. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why I like the HQ solution, again... it means that language is mechanically included, and treated as anything else, so you may, if you wish, investigate how it impacts any particular contest, or ignore it at your lesiure if it's not your thing. It's only important when you want it to be. And, the purchasing option being available, you can usually plausibly avoid the language barrier problem when you need to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above is an attempt to discuss Andy's main question. But then there's Ryan's interesting follow-up, where he does intend, quite diliberately and directedly, to investigate the language barrier. OK, that's way cool, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe single simplest and, I think, most common use for language barrier in RPGs is as a privacy mode. That is, you have the two dwarfs, and an elf, then they probably all use common to speak to each other most of the time - but if the dwarfs want to speak to each other, and not let the elf in on what they're saying, then then can communicate in the language they share with each other, and which the elf doesn't know. This can be done for several reasons, but often is done mostly as a slight to the character left out of the conversation or just to annoy them. Sometimes it's done for tactical reasons. If you figure that the orcs don't speak your language, then you can feel free to shout battle plans to each other in the midst of a fight, and your opponents won't be able to take advantage. Etc, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis relates to the concept of inclusiveness that David was getting at, following the discussion between Renato, Johnstone and Chris, or Paul earlier in the thread. This isn't a new idea... Gygax included the Theives' Cant in early versions of D&amp;D. But it's definitely fun, again, to think of this as a social skill. One's rank in an organization could be very closely tied to how well they speak. It's probably arguable that those who speak well rise in rank. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for speaking Gibberish... I hope that was in jest. I have done this for comic effect, or to get the idea across in short bits on occasion. But I always then immediately move on to, "You can't understand a word he's saying, as he goes on and on trying to explain something to you."

Needless to say, in my next game, everyone bought Ancient Asyrian, Arameic and Sanscrit as bonus languages, just to be sure.<br/><br/>Language can be very frustrating in real life: I might be able to speak and read in English and Spanish, and read some French, Catalan and Latin. But whenever some of my friends speak in Finnish, I'm at a complete loss. Some of my favorite writers are Serbian, and I know I'll never read them in the original, and, when I met one of them, I had to rely on a translator. My only point here is that, if you're going for realistic, multiple languages are going to be frustrating and plain unfun.<br/><br/>Also, the idea of language families and affiliations is pretty recent, and, arguably, in a Medieval-based fantasy game, not at all that apparent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119448/#Comment_119448" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T11:48:42+00:00" title="January 14, 2008 11:48AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Translator," above, made me think of nice situational hooks around language (if using Mike's Point 1).

And even while they do not know the language, I allow them to try understanding it by other means (asociation, body-language, etc). I like "role playing" foreign and strange languages as gibbering. That way they feel they are actually missing something.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf everything else fails, they do have access to magic (They can use Tongues and Comprehend Languages. I play DnD. Sue me!)<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that I also use that same setting for some written stories, and I like playing on the cultural differences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
