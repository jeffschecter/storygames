This list is called the \u2018Menu\u2019, and each of the things on that list is an \u2018Ingredient\u2019.<br/><br/><b>Using Adjectives and Nouns</b><br/>One method of generating Ingredients is to define (as a group) features that make Barsoom different from other science-fiction worlds.<br/><br/>To use this method, try to find a single adjective or noun that encapsulates each defining feature. The best such adjective or noun is one that suggests an emotion, a cultural aspect, or even a philosophy.<br/><br/><i>Trevor defines Barsoom as a romantic vision of Mars, and so he chooses the adjective \u2018romantic\u2019 as an Ingredient in the Menu. Koren says that for her Barsoom is a savage world of honour, noble sacrifice and constant struggle. There are lots there to work with, and she chooses the adjectives, \u2018savage\u2019 and \u2018noble\u2019, and the noun \u2018struggle\u2019, for the Menu. And Evan articulates that for him Barsoom is filled with lost cities, heroic adventures, and forgotten, ancient secrets. Again, lots there, but he settles on \u2018adventures\u2019 as the noun to add to the Menu, and \u2018ancient\u2019 and \u2018heroic\u2019 as his adjectives. Fi-nally, Sanjay says Barsoom is about the celebration of com-passion, loyalty and bravery. And so he writes down \u2018loyalty\u2019, \u2018compassion\u2019 and \u2018bravery\u2019 on the Menu. <br/><br/>Now the group has an initial list of Ingredients that reads, romantic, savage, noble, struggle, adventures, ancient, heroic, loyalty, compassion and bravery.</i><br/><br/><b>Using Popular Media</b><br/>Another way to come up with Ingredients is for each player to name a favoured sample of media that explores the sword-and-planet genre. Consider the media examples listed in Appendix X. <br/><br/>Usually, it is best to come up with and review this kind of media before getting together to play.<br/><br/>Now each player names what about his chosen media-sample he thinks is most engaging or particularly representative of Barsoom. These preferences become your list of Ingredients.<br/><br/><i>Trevor listens to \u2018The Tharks\u2019 (a song by the Russian band, Barsoom, from their album \u2018Under the Moons of Mars\u2019), and thinks it\u2019s both romantic and violently heroic. So he chooses, \u2018violent heroism\u2019 and \u2018romance\u2019, for Ingredients. Evan watches the old \u2018He-Man\u2019 T.V. episode, \u2018Double-edged Sword\u2019 (as representative of the sword-and-planet genre) and picks up on \u2018high-technology among ancient ruins\u2019 and \u2018desert\u2019 as features of that episode. Inspired by 1980s T.V, Sanjay watches the first episode of \u2018Darkstar\u2019 (again, being representative of the same genre), and selects \u2018lost cities\u2019 as his Ingredient to include. And Koren reads the English translation of Oscar Hurtado\u2019s, \u2018La ciudad muerta de Korad\u2019, and selects \u2018blood-thirsty foes\u2019 and \u2018lost stranger\u2019 as Ingredients.<br/><br/>The group now has this for a list of Ingredients: violent heroism; romance; high-technology among ancient ruins; desert; lost cities; blood-thirsty foes; and lost stranger.<br/></i><br/>In the example above, the group has not restricted itself to interpreting their media to just adjectives and nouns, and that\u2019s just fine. They are still keeping their Ingredients relatively concise.<br/><br/><b>Use the List Provided</b><br/>Alternatively, you can use the list of Ingredients for a Barsoomian campaign included with these rules in Appendix X. If you use this list, then each player chooses up to two Ingredients from it to add to the Menu for your gaming session.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti" title="lorenzogatti"><img alt="lorenzogatti" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti">lorenzogatti</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449023/#Comment_449023" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-14T09:53:52+00:00" title="October 14, 2015  9:53AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice guidelines, but how much of this kind of setting definition should be preliminary (as implied here) and how much could be improvised during play instead? <br/>I expect some of the agreed elements, when players actually elaborate the standards and goals of the campaign, are going to be <ul><li>conflicting in non-obvious ways (e.g. you want encounters with exotic wildlife, I want court intrigues based on alien laws and customs, and even on Mars there's no reasonable way to have both in the same place and time)</li> <li>discarded as a liability (e.g. you want sex with martians, but another player is very uncomfortable with it)</li> <li>overshadowed by something unforeseen (e.g. you want martial heroism but it becomes a distant character goal because everybody likes the current exploration and diplomacy missions that are meant to prepare the war) </li>\nTherefore, only indispensable foundations should be decided in advance.

Each of you will sketch out your piece of Barsoom, working with each others\u2019 ideas until you know a little bit of what Barsoom is like.<br/><br/>Once you know the most basic pieces of Barsoom, you\u2019ll begin to chronicle its history...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CreativeMage" title="CreativeMage"><img alt="CreativeMage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/212/nJRPAL1YGL0U7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CreativeMage">CreativeMage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449034/#Comment_449034" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-14T20:35:25+00:00" title="October 14, 2015  8:35PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ingredients are aspects of the sword-&amp;-planet genre that the players want to explore with this history.
