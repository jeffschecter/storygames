It felt like functional Munchkin in a silly but not totally incoherent world, which was great.  But we ran into problems, too.<br/><br/>In the first Labyrinth, LL'd by me, Marion and Oliviana did quite well (there were some mechanical mistakes though, which I suspect may have made things initially easier, but made them get to the boss too quickly) until they reached the boss.  They got KO'd, failed the Jailbreak, and had to be rescued by Sparkles.  End of Labyrinth.  Not a big deal, but I definitely noticed the overall fun level went down a lot as soon as the PCs started getting KO'd a whole lot.  A common problem in challenge-based play: if the challenges are *too* hard, fun breaks down.<br/><br/>In the second Labyrinth, which was Encounter Level 7, Sparkles and Marion encountered a single Level 7 monster on their first move, and got KO'd.  Boo.  We stopped there.<br/><br/>A bunch of mechanical questions:<br/><br/>-Obviously each Labyrinth has one King, and only one.  Do I put in a King of the appropriate suit and take out all three other Kings?  (After doing the rest of the Labyrinth layout, of course.)  What would the King of Hearts even look like?<br/><br/>-How do you know whether or not there will be any other BBs?  If no one has statted up any, should I remove all the Queens and Jacks from the Labyrinth deck?  (On a related note, when dealing out Labyrinth deck cards to the non-LLs, should one remove the face cards first?)<br/><br/>-On a related note, what the hell does the Jack (or Queen, for that matter) of Diamonds represent?  A Treasure room guarded by a Mark or Nemesis?<br/><br/>-Are you allowed to put more than one Labyrinth card adjacent to the gateway?  (Also, what do you use to represent the gateway?  We used a face-up card that we just said, "OK, this isn't an actual encounter, it's just the gateway.")  So that from the gateway there is more than one choice of direction?<br/><br/>-If I have a Level 6 Labyrinth, and the players flip up, say, an Eight of Clubs, what does the LL throw at them?  A level 6 encounter?  Why not just remove all the cards of higher value than 6 from the deck before laying out the Labyrinth?  (Another similar thing we ran into: the King of the Labyrinth called for Minions, and drew two black cards, but both were higher than the Encounter Level of the Labyrinth; I ruled that he got a single Level 6 Minion\u2014was this correct?  [I could also have given him two level 3 minions, or a level 2 and a level 4, etc.])<br/><br/>-If the PCs flip up, say a five of clubs, but the LL has no acolyte monsters statted up, I should just stat one up real quick, right?<br/><br/>-Let's say you're a Level 4 PC with 3 items.  If you take, say, 5 damage, can you elect to just be KO'd and not lose any items, counting on your allies (or in this case, ally) to heal you when the combat is over?  The way the text reads it seems like you could, but it's not clear.<br/><br/>-OK, here's the big one: Specialties seemed to us to be really broken.  Both times there was a TPKO, it was because of Specialties.  They're at <i>double</i> the monster's <i>total</i> level?  And there's <i>no</i> way to reduce them?  I mean, I triple-checked the book, and I know this <i>is</i> correct, but in the textual examples it seemed like the PCs were just getting lucky.  In our play it lead to a lot of frustration.  That said, there were some errors made, particularly in facing the King of the first Labyrinth, that allowed the PCs to reach the King too quickly \u2014 maybe if they'd faced more intermediate monsters they'd have been better-able to handle him.  There were also some tactical errors, like not closing with a monster specialized in blast.  But still.  Really?<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>Matt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228693/#Comment_228693" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-30T08:11:39+00:00" title="August 30, 2009  8:11AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I don't have the book to hand, but... off the top of my head.<br/><br/>You have two decks of cards: one is complete including Jokers and is used for dealing out cards in play; the other has the face cards removed (i.e. maximum of 10) and is used as the Labyrinth deck for making the dungeon -- the GM places the King and two false endings onto the dungeon, I don't think you get Jacks or Queens in a Dungeon.<br/><br/>So, there is only one BB in a Dungeon.<br/><br/>I've just made monsters up to the Level needed on the fly. So, a 6 could either be one Level 6 monster or three Level 2s or a Level 4 and two Level 1s. Sometimes we've amde suitable monsters beforehand, and other times we've just made them on the spot.<br/><br/>If I've drawn a card higher than the Level allowed I just max it out at the Level allowed. I guess it biases the monsters to be higher rather than lower (i;e. the distribution between 1 and 6 isn't even, it's more likely to be 6 than 1-5).<br/><br/>When you take damage I've put bleed tokens on the Levels that I've been damaged. We usually rest before proceeding so that we can heal, but the LL then gets a random encounter I think.<br/><br/>We fought a Ninja with a high level Sneak. It was a pain in the ass, but once we got hold of him we could bleed him down (I think only 1 of us survived the encounter -- and it wasn't the dude who had statted him up at the start of the session!). The damage we did to him reduced his cards, but you *need* to get to the right range and target his weakness (monsters have classes and only one really good thing). If you face a Speciality at its best range then... yeah... you'll get hosed.

You have to place a King and two Jokers in a Labyrinth, but Queens and Jacks are specific extra Big Bads and I'd leave them out at first. My take is that you'd want to establish these characters in/between adventures before adding their complication in.<br/><br/>On the subject of flipping a card higher than the Encounter Level of the Labyrinth p. 40/41 has that, using the Wooly Minotaur as an example.

I thought that Joe might come in himself to answer these, but as he seems to be remiss and Gregor is giving faulty answers, I'll try my best from memory:<br/><br/>The labyrinth creation procedure page describes how, after removing the face cards, you create the labyrinth by laying cards on the table, alternating between the GM and the players. <i>After this</i> the GM takes the king card (doesn't matter which one as far as I see) and up to four other faces/jokers, which he gets to add to the labyrinth at any positions where they connect to the original cards laid by the committee. The idea is that this way the players do not know where the king is, as the GM laid out up to five cards. This is also how marks and nemesises get into the labyrinth.<br/><br/>Also, the value of the labyrinth card is not enforced as the value of the monster encounter - it's just the <i>upper limit</i> of the individual monster size in the encounter. Thus there is no need to modify the deck or do other stuff just because the labyrinth level is under ten - getting a high card just means that you get to put in a single, large monster instead of many small ones.<br/><br/>Going back to the first post, some more clarifications:\n<ul>\n<li>The suit of a face card is not used the same way the suits normally are in figuring out what a room contains. Thus there is no such thing as a "NPC Nemesis" or a "Treasure room Mark", for example. This is not said directly in the book, so I might be wrong, but as there are no rules for doing anything with the face card suits, it's a pretty safe bet that you just ignore them.</li>\n<li>You can put more than one card next to the gateway, but only by connecting there from the other cards according to the legal plays. So you first put a card to the corner of the gateway and then come to the other face of the gateway from the side.</li>\n<li>The rules do not say what you should do if you don't have a rules-legal monster to work with; my own inclination would be to make sure that the players create a low-level guard and a low-level acolyte during the first round of monster creation before the first labyrinth, thus ensuring that the GM always has a legal monster. Remember that you don't have to match the value of the labyrinth card with the monster, you can just pile several monsters until you get to the dungeon's threat value. So create a 1-level guard and 1-level acolyte at the beginning, and you'll always have something legal to play.</li>\n<li>You can get knocked out and still possess items, the rules do not force you to sacrifice items.</li>\n</ul>\nGregor has the book at hand, so presumably he can verify or correct these.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229130/#Comment_229130" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T23:05:30+00:00" title="August 31, 2009 11:05PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2009 11:05PM by Ludanto.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While it doesn't explain why, the rules do suggest that the monsters made by the LL be low level, like level 1 or level 2.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JJ%20Prince" title="JJ Prince"><img alt="JJ Prince" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/images/minis/tinyGP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JJ%20Prince">JJ Prince</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229147/#Comment_229147" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T03:18:36+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  3:18AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            HI guys cheers for the input.<br/><br/>I wrote a detailed and incredibly witty reply yesterday then storygames ate it - what a bastard.

You don't <i>have </i>to use magic specialised monsters, but acolytes are the only time you <i>can </i>use them. So if you don't have any just use a normal beast (though 6 acolytes are included as ready made minions).<br/><br/>Specialities are very powerful - each monster is a one-trick pony, but it's a good trick! If you find yourselves at long range from a blasting specialist then running away is an attractive option.

Dapper Skellingtons are level 4, with a specialty of <b>Blast</b>.  Since specialties are at <em>double</em> a minion's <em>total</em> level, and since Dapper Skellingtons have a total level of 4, their Blast specialty should be at 8.  However, when at the top of page 62, Neville has his Dapper Skellingtons (of which there are two) attack Fergus, he only seems to draw 8 cards, not 16.  Shouldn't he have drawn 16 cards if the Dapper Skellingtons had ganged up on Fergus, of 8 cards twice if they had not?  Now, admittedly, since in the example Fergus drew a Joker, he wasn't going to take damage no matter what.<br/><br/>But I'd still like to know if I was reading the rules correctly or not, or was I missing something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JJ%20Prince" title="JJ Prince"><img alt="JJ Prince" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/images/minis/tinyGP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JJ%20Prince">JJ Prince</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237076/#Comment_237076" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T16:30:28+00:00" title="October 12, 2009  4:30PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi there Peter.<br/><br/>Glad to hear you've pcked up the game - may it bring you much fun in the future!<br/><br/>In the example you mention the skellington team attack refers to Eric and Tinker<i>ganging up</i> on Fergus.

So, players need to make sure that they assign their mark or nemesis to a previously unassigned card, and the LL needs to look carefully at the currently assigned jacks and queens before using them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JJ%20Prince" title="JJ Prince"><img alt="JJ Prince" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/images/minis/tinyGP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JJ%20Prince">JJ Prince</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238966/#Comment_238966" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-24T04:16:03+00:00" title="October 24, 2009  4:16AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Correctamundo!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238986/#Comment_238986" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-24T09:46:18+00:00" title="October 24, 2009  9:46AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joey P</cite>Correctamundo!</blockquote>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
