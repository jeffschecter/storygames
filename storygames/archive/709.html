<p>I'm looking for a little brainstorming help in doing a bit of a hack to tMW.</p>
<p>See, I dig the game, but I always play it in a considerably shorter time than it was intended for, and some of the fates are a little tough to wrap your brain around in that short of time.  <strong>Worst Fear</strong> always ends up being the trouble-child of the group.  None of the new players that I sit down with ever know what to do with it.  Hell, the last time I played I drew it, had what I thought was an awesome idea for it, and it totally went nowhere.  Bummer.</p>
<p>So, what I'd like to do is come up with half a dozen 'fresh' Fates that drive the game just a little faster than the ones in the book.  Here's my ideas on what would make good 6 hour Fates;</p>
<p>1)  They <em>must</em> inspire a relationship of some flavor between your character and one or more of the other characters.  Preferably more than one of the other characters.  Four of the existing Fates already do this, but I wanted to underline how important I think this is.</p>
<p>2)  They could inspire the players to author scenery, setting, props (items), and other bits of niftyness during play.  I theorize that a strong bit of inspiration here would help inspire players to reveal their Fates earlier in play.  Late-coming Fates have been a regular issue in my sessions, as has been players that aren't inspired to author NPCs or setting elements into the story.</p>
<p>3)  I'd love to see the Fates actually be more um... "Fate-like".  The standard Fates talk a lot about the characters' pasts, but I'd like to get the 6 Hour versions in line with the futures of the characters.</p>
<p>Now, to tie all that together, lemmie give you all an idea of what I've got in mind;</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p><em>The steel of your ancestors, in the hands of your favorite sibling, will be your end.</em></p>
<p><em>Secrets are revealed to you when you express your deepest love to your greatest enemy.</em></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Shit like that.<br/>
Anyone have any ideas?  I'd love to hear them.</p>

<p>Well, as I can't see any real loss from knowing what the Fates will be, I'd say that more participation = more awesome for everyone.</p>
<p>In fact, I'd be especially interested in knowing what you think of changing the Fates.  Are you familiar with the base six?</p>

                            I've discussed it with Tim.  I've even played with Tim.  I had the pleasure of GMing his own creation for him at GenCon.<br/>
<br/>
However, his goals with the game aren't the same as mine.  I want short games with the GM whipping the players every step of the way, he likes longer, multi-session games where things unfold slowly.<br/>
<br/>
And, again, it's been my experience that Worst Fear is very weak in a short-form game.<br/>

<p>It was the first Fate I ever played, and it was a one-shot of six hours.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that you should therefore like it. I'm saying it can be done and enjoyed. My character's worst fear was confronting the fact that nothing he could do would bring back his master and lover.</p>
<p>I think if you simplify the Fates, you reduce their impact. If you don't, I'm very curious to know what you come up with.</p>

I know you mean well and all, but I'm not really looking to hear that I'm wrong or that I'm going to fuck with the quality of the game for trying to do this.  I know how the current fates work, and I'm looking for something else.  Care to help out with that?<br/>

                            Eric,<br/><br/>After refreshing my recollection of the existing Fates, I'm a bit torn. I can see how several of them are weak for a short-form game, requiring more time to develop and be revealed. And I heartily approve the 3 principles you've listed. I'd also add a fourth: the short-form Fates should all call for some action. This would drive the players forward toward some end, not allow them to wallow about unsure where to go. Overall, I think this means revenge and unholy pact could still be used pretty effectively in the short-form game.<br/><br/>I'm also concerned your two examples are a bit too tightly constrained to allow the player freedom to interpret what the Fate is all about. For example, I would change the first one to "The steel of your ancestors, in the hands of someone you trust, will be your end," giving the player a lot more leeway. <br/><br/>Let me mull on some other options.                        </div>

                            Right on.  I'm open to the idea that my examples may be poo.  I'm even open to the idea that some of the existing Fates may fall completely into what I wanna do.  But I'd still like to come up with six fresh ones.  <br/>

                            Eric,<br/><br/>How have you been coming along with this? I'm psyched to see the eventual results come Gen Con. Below are a couple potential Fates I came up with. They ended up a bit too long, I think, but I'll leave you to judge. Feel free to edit, ignore, or use at your leisure.<br/><br/>-You know the only way to redeem your dishonor is to cleanse the stain with your blood. But are your companions worthy of your sacrifice?<br/>-You are dying of a slow, painful disease that you want to keep secret from your companions. Perhaps there is a cure, but if not, you hope to die sword in hand, not in a sickbed<br/>-You are one of the Ainu (the oft-despised minority race of Japan), and you know this mission is an opportunity to achieve the glory you deserve. You will grasp it whatever the cost.                        </div>

<p>I just finished reading tMW, so let me try to come up with a few Fates off the cuff. Just brainstorming...</p>
<p><em>Mercy</em> You have promised your soul to the Gods, and thus have faith that there is something to be found in the Witch's life - some element of culture or fragment of his past - that proves he is worth salvation and forgiveness. Your fellows have only blood on their minds. What will it cost you to be the bringer of Mercy?</p>
<p><em>Gluttony</em> In the deep of your heart, where most find a soul, you know only a hunger for riches, luxuries, comforts, but you can enjoy none of them: you can only acquire, consume and destroy them. You know how to fake a brave face, but ultimately you're all about your own Greed - and you know that your avarice will cost a fellow man very greatly.</p>
<p><em>Assassin</em> This bounty is nothing compared to what drives you to an unforgivable deed, assassinating one of your fellow ronin in the course of this adventure. The terms of your contract are clear: firstly, by discussion, come to confirm that this man is conceivably the target of the contract; then, eliminate him. Make it look like an accident if possible, or kill him without any witnesses present. If this is not possible, you must destroy both of yourselves, but above all you must not return from Mt. Fuji without fulfilling your task.</p>
<p><em>Artisan</em> You are the master of some craft or true art, and through a dream you know with certainty: you will have your once chance to create a masterwork here, on Mt. Fuji, at the lair of the foul Mountain Witch. You may be able to take this moment to create a work of glory that will last thousands of years, but whether you do or you not, you know that your skill will fade quickly as you descend from the Mountain.</p>
<p><em>True Power</em> The Mountain Witch possesses a terrible power, and something drives you - a secret patron, or perhaps your own ambition - to take control of his manse once he is defeated, or die trying in the attempt. What is the nature of his power, and can it be controlled?</p>
