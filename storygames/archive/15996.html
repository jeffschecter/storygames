So we're playing a modern day, one-on-one game with classical demons from medieval woodcuttings, and Carly has decided that her demon, Vetis, has a Desire for <i>acquisition.</i> And I am pumped about playing this guy. At the moment he just seems strange and wacky and a bit annoying, like he has a cell phone and is fascinated with downloading apps, and he went grocery shopping and now her fridge and freezer is totally STUFFED with raw meat, and they visited a friend of hers and that scene hasn't resolved yet but he's totally going to try to pocket some of her shit. But I totally see him eventually going somewhere sinister and terrible, like he'll buy the apartment building she lives and evict the inhabitants and then start buying <i>people</i> and chaining them up in the basement. He might start a business and hire her friends, but I don't know what kind of business it would be yet.<br/><br/>Well, I guess the obvious business would be acquisitions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364328/#Comment_364328" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T14:12:44+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  2:12PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Sorcerer</i>'s fuckin' great, ainit?

We had, like, sessions, plural, where I was interacting with my demon a lot and barely rolling anything all session--my demon wasn't opposing me at all, because everything I was doing was working perfectly into her plans. And, eventually, shit hit the fan in a big way.

As long as the demon is aligned with the Humanity/world-building details everyone came up with, I don't think you need to worry too much about anything except playing them more or less as they are. (Outside of specific Bangs you come up with, I mean.) Left unchecked they will just naturally reach a point where what they want to do is emphatically not-good for the Sorcerer or someone they care about.<br/><br/>Edit to add: I wish I was playing Sorcerer, hrmph.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364358/#Comment_364358" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T15:53:51+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  3:53PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Demons as cartoons is really important.<br/><br/>I'm GMing the game Hans is talking about.  It took me 2 or 3 sessions to finally find his demon (a passer named Kennedy)'s voice.  When I finally did the idea I had seemed super stupid.  Kennedy is Hans's PC's connection to the art world.  She's basically his agent.  I finally stumbled on the idea that she wants to make a reality show about struggling artists and plans to rig things so that Hans's character (Kelly) comes out on top.  My first thought was: no, that's dumb.  Then I remembered the cartoon thing and ran with it.<br/><br/>All of a sudden Kennedy is all over Kelly's life.  She's pushing him to make "dramatic" decisions for the sake of the "narrative" she's building around him for the audience.  At one point Kennedy moved into Kelly's basement and there was this scene where Kelly went down to visit her and discovered that she had this huge bank of monitors set up down there and that she'd installed cameras all over his life and was just obsessively editing footage.<br/><br/>Yeah, it was great.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364543/#Comment_364543" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T06:47:07+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  6:47AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I wish I knew why the "demons are cartoons" thing was such a huge key to unlocking Sorcerer play for me so I could articulate it. But it makes them way more fun, and it also occasionally startles me. Like where we're at in the game now, Vetis is running around the sorcerer's friend's apartment stealing things and he totally dominated her on a Will roll to get him to stop (complete victory) so obviously he just keeps going and stealing EVERYTHING he can. Books, spoons, an apple. And I totally didn't see the scene going this way where the sorcerer is trying to comfort her grieving friend and her demon is running around ransacking the place. He's not doing it to piss her off, he's doing it <i>because that's what he is.</i><br/><br/>I guess they key was in realizing that they don't have to be malicious or subversive in order to cause problems. They just have to have recognizable motivations that they take way, way too far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364563/#Comment_364563" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T07:28:21+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  7:28AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorcerer AP makes me happy.
