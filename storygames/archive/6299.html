But I don't know how to do it properly for my game. Can you share you experiences and wisdom?<br/><br/>The background: Principia is set in an alternate-world renaissance where the players resolve the burning questions of the age while fighting for the things they care about. PCs have drives, which are dynamic aspirations, relationships, or burning personal questions. Drives act as flags and provide resources when the PCs engage them or seek to resolve them. Through the War of Ideas mechanic, the struggles of the PCs are woven in with the abstract questions of the age. Check out the Web site for a bit more:<br/><a href="http://planet-thirteen.com/Principia.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://planet-thirteen.com/Principia.aspx</a><br/><br/>In setting design, we decide what several particular areas of the world, called positions, mean in our setting. The positions are: art, alchemy, astrology, the Church, engineering, heresy, nobility, and reformation (with maybe some additions).<br/><br/>So, for example, we may decide that in our world alchemists mix chemicals and blow things up, engineerings build clockwork robots, and the Church runs thing from cathedral zeppelins. Or maybe alchemists are charlatans who con nobles with stories of lead turned into gold, engineers are social maniupators and use brainwashing, and the Church fearfuly worships the Greek gods (who literally exist and walk the earth).<br/><br/>Also we create a proto NPC and maybe an organization for each position.<br/><br/>Ideally, this process should give us several things:<br/>- NPCs to make the focus of PC drives<br/>- Ideas, social norms, and institutions to be challenged (or affirmed) through the War of Ideas<br/>- Cool hooks and gimmicks to build interest and be exploited in play<br/><br/>A compact, evocative setting is desired, rather than a laboriously detailed document.<br/><br/>I've got a few prospective ways of doing this, but I'm bewlidered by the options and not sure which method will give me what I want. Here's what I'm considering:<br/>- Have a setting design session where we sit down and answer a bunch of pre-set questions about the setting<br/>- Have a gab session where the GM makes notes, then makes the decisions and brings them to the game<br/>- Present a default setting, then write up a number of "other ways to play"<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139490/#Comment_139490" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-13T08:56:53+00:00" title="April 13, 2008  8:56AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>I've got a few prospective ways of doing this, but I'm bewlidered by the options and not sure which method will give me what I want.

If someone likes customising the game world, essentially they get to do some of that at the very start, then never ever do it again for as long as the campaign runs. And for someone who doesn't like customising, they wont look twice at those rules. It stiffles the ones who are interested in using it, and it wont be used at all by the ones who aren't interested.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/schlafmanko" title="schlafmanko"><img alt="schlafmanko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/schlafmanko">schlafmanko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139545/#Comment_139545" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-13T20:58:28+00:00" title="April 13, 2008  8:58PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2008 9:09PM by schlafmanko.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think it's that much of a problem if the players customize the world at the beginning and then hand subsequent control over to the GM.  I figure there are two main reasons to customize a setting: so that it interacts more fruitfully with the thematic questions the players want to address, and so that players have a stronger emotional investment in the game. (i.e. by gaining a direct sense of ownership over the world, incorporating elements that they have visceral reactions to, and linking those to other player's thematic issues as well as their own)  Neither of those necessarily needs continuing player tinkering to work.<br/><br/>The first of those reasons (tighter thematic focus) is why it's good to have character creation and setting customization integrated with each other.  It also sounds closer to what Tony's going for in the reasons he lists. <br/><br/>At least in my experience, when setting customization and character creation get too far separated, it's easy to wind up  creating a world for its own sake, based entirely on what seems cool.  You wind up creating so much cool stuff that you don't know what to do with yourself.  Especially when you're creating collaboratively, the world addresses a kitchen sink full of themes that don't necessarily play off of each other, and then you get to character creation and create a new set of issues that's only tangentially related to the thematic issues that the setting is best suited to address.  Tony has enough different areas open for customization that I'd worry about that happening unless people went into the customization process with a clear agenda.  <br/><br/>I love creating cultures, but what I prefer is a system of customization that lets you tweak / create the cultural setting to make it more suited to what you want to address in play.  When my group started our most recent game, we followed a process that went something like vague set of themes --&gt; vague setting --&gt; vague characters --&gt; slightly more focused themes --&gt; more concrete bits of setting --&gt; less vague characters, and repeat until things are as fleshed out as you want.   The other advantage of this was that it helped us create characters that interest each other, because as the characters were being made, they incorporated setting elements that other people were coming up with to address the themes they were interested in.  <br/><br/>If increasing player investment is one of the goals of customization, I suspect it would be better served by having the players answer questions together, rather than talking and then handing things over to a GM.  When I don't know which of my setting creation ideas the GM is going to incorporate, I feel less ownership over the setting and get confused about what I can consider true about it.  It makes the world feel more nebulous and distant to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20K" title="John K"><img alt="John K" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20K">John K</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139552/#Comment_139552" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-14T01:16:07+00:00" title="April 14, 2008  1:16AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How I'd do it (borrowing from both Shock and a game I'm writing)...<br/><br/><b>Pre-campaign section</b>: Make a grid with the positions along the top and required info along the side (multiple boxes exist for some things). Each player takes it in turns to fill in until it is 1/2 full.<br/><b>During campaign section</b>: Everyone has a Setting score that starts at 0. Anyone can fill in a box at any time and gets 1 setting. Someone with a lower Setting score can veto the 'box filling' and replace it with there own idea (they gain Setting and the original player doesn't in this case).<br/><br/>Thus you have a world that is complete enough to play in but still accepts ideas from the players later. Players includes the GM, and you could weight his influence on the setting if you liked (2 goes for every 1 of the players, 1/2 Setting point per idea later, fill in one box per position free, whatever you like really).<br/><br/>As schlafmanko suggested you may want to integrate this with character generation. It's a nice idea and may also reduced the amount of time required to set up a game. The 'During campaign section' has worked for me in play testing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139764/#Comment_139764" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T11:01:30+00:00" title="April 15, 2008 11:01AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2008 11:06AM by Jogesh EZ.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>Also we create a proto NPC and maybe an organization for each position.<br/><br/>Ideally, this process should give us several things:<br/>- NPCs to make the focus of PC drives<br/>- Ideas, social norms, and institutions to be challenged (or affirmed) through the War of Ideas<br/>- Cool hooks and gimmicks to build interest and be exploited in play<br/><br/>A compact, evocative setting is desired, rather than a laboriously detailed document.<br/><br/>I've got a few prospective ways of doing this, but I'm bewlidered by the options and not sure which method will give me what I want.

I'd take a look at Falling Blossoms and Burning Empires (possibly Mortal Coil and Solophist too, but I haven't seen how those work). The point is, make those questions more than just about the setting.  They should fill out character drives, place NPCs - both friend and enemy, give characters connections to each other, and lay out the background in a general sense.<br/><br/>Going back to the first part.  Make the creation of NPCs a part of character creation.  Or more explicitly, make the NPCs a part of character stats (and intertwined with drives either directly or just mechanically) and make ideas, social norms, and institutions a part of character stats (what do they believe, is it normal or scandalous, and what's their relationship with one or more institutions).  I suspect that hooks and gimmicks will automatically build interest since players are likely going to be creating characters that interest them.  And more so if their drives are consistent with the rest.<br/><br/>If the positions are all connected within this, you should have your setting creation occuring as well. Someone might decide that they hate the Church, are an apprentice engineer, and has an NPC nemesis who's an alchemist. Everyone gets to decide what those mean (or at least players with characters that have those connections, to the approval and advice to the rest of the group for something everyone thinks is cool).<br/><br/>But in short, the way I see encouraging setting customization is to make it an inherent part of getting the game off and running. It has to be a part of character creation, or at the very least, a group activity at the beginning of a campaign (it could be something only the GM does, but that's boring and plenty of games have done that for the past 30 years). Doing it just in the text will certainly present the option (take a look at the WoD books - total sandboxes, but only encouraged by the text, there's no system that backs it up, so many games end up using the broad default assumptions) but it won't be encouraged as a part of play, and I think you'll find many instances of play would end up using whatever seems to be the "default" way to play (probably something very much resembling Renaissance Europe with a bit of magic and fantasy).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139773/#Comment_139773" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T11:31:26+00:00" title="April 15, 2008 11:31AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's SO much out there to use as guidelines, I just say Go Research:<br/>* <i>Burning Empire</i>'s World Burning neatly integrates the nature of the world with what the PCs want to play (if at all foresighted) and yet hangs neatly with the over-arching meta-setting (it helps that it's sci fi and, thus, can support a vast variety of worlds).<br/>* <i>Universalis</i> Tenets give every player a say in the initial story premises, with a economy mechanic to provide limited veto power. All further Facts follow the same economy of give and take.<br/>* <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> basically hands the players the narrative authority over what is "Faithful," so that they can explore the issues that most interest them. Fans have, basically, boiled out the mechanics one must change to "drift" to totally different settings or genres. (You gotta break all that stuff out, to avoid being "genre-bound" or to avoid others having to do it for you... poorly.)<br/>* <i>ASCII <a href="/forums/profile/HACK">@HACK</a></i> (ahem) takes the <i>Universalis</i> coin mechanic and puts it squarely into a character's domain, allowing the Adventurer to "find" items by buying them, or the Opposition to "write-up" zones and challenges by buying them.<br/><br/>My own ever-unfinished generic LARP system, being more traditional, approaches this by establishing several initial Options and Toggles, to suit genre, and then advises (err, will advise) GMs how to combine Abilities and Modifiers to create all manner of effects. What the GMs do to "storify" those is left as an exercise for the reader (though I offer--err, will offer--a lot of general advice about pacing, factionalism, economy management, site practicalities, etc).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
