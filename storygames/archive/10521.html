This started out as a pirate game, but in an effort to focus on social dynamics (rather than sabres and pistols) I\u2019ve reworked it as an rpg for playing out <i>The Lord of the Flies.</i> Though the game has changed a lot in the process, some of you may recognize some of what follows from a query I posted a week ago over on the Forge forums. Those guys were really helpful, but the forum software has been really unresponsive this past few days, so I\u2019m shifting the discussion over here. <br/><br/>I\u2019d like to get feedback on my system for tracking and rewarding social relationships: both the abstract dynamic (am I trampling my fruitful void?) and the resource economy (will resources balance out over the long term?) Assuming that all goes well, I\u2019ll be submitting this for Iron Chef, so let me know whom to credit for any help received. <br/><br/><b>Four basic traits</b>: Hope, Fear, Brutality, Cunning. Since traits rise and fall throughout play, they are tracked using poker chips. Each character has a different color of poker chip, so the game silently tracks the exchange of chips between characters.<br/><br/>Hope keeps you going from day to day. It\u2019s used to find everything you need to survive. <br/>Fear keeps you alive in times of danger.<br/>Brutality hurts others and makes you stronger.<br/>Cunning tricks others and makes you smarter.<br/><br/><b>Conflicts: </b>Narrative stakes are set at the outset of any conflict, just as in DitV. Any of the four traits can be used to contest a conflict, so long as the stakes and the means employed are appropriate to the trait in question. In addition to winning the stakes, the winner of a conflict also wins a bonus and the loser suffers a penalty, which varies depending on the trait employed:<br/><br/>If you win with Hope, gain Hope and lose Fear; if you lose with Hope, gain Fear.<br/>If you win with Fear, gain nothing; if you lose with Fear, gain nothing.<br/>If you win with Brutality, steal 1 Hope from the loser and place on your Brutality; if you lose with Brutality, gain Fear.<br/>If you win with Cunning, steal 1 Hope from the loser and place on your Cunning; if you lose with Cunning, gain Fear.<br/><br/>Note that these effects combine: if you lose with Hope against someone using Brutality, you gain Fear AND your opponent steals one Hope from you.<br/><br/>The conflict system uses a standard poker deck: the higher your trait, the more cards you draw at the beginning of conflict. Cards are laid down for 3 passes, with the high card winning. I don\u2019t want to go into extra detail, but there\u2019s also a simple system for several people to combine forces and fight on one side in a conflict. Obviously, friends will cooperate during conflicts, as also minions will often work together to do their master\u2019s bidding. Friends have a special power which makes them more effective when working as allies in a conflict than two minions working together (see below). Of course, two minions can be friends with one another. I\u2019m not sure that masters can be friends with their minions, though.<br/><br/>There\u2019s also a rule for <b>escalation</b> (really desperation): if you don\u2019t like the look of your cards, at any time during a conflict you can draw more cards in an effort to avoid losing the stakes of the conflict. If you were using Hope, Cunning or Brutality, draw Fear; if you were using Fear, draw Hope. A win accomplished through desperation still counts as a loss for purposes of adjusting Traits (as if the original conflict had been forfeited), but counts as a draw for purposes of the stakes. My thought here is to create a system which is the inverse of DitV: encourage players to go for high stakes so that when things go south they\u2019re motivated to act out of desperation. <br/><br/><b>A resource economy based on Hope:</b> Assuming good weather (true 2/3 of the time), everyone gains 1 Hope as dawn breaks over the island. Over the course of the day, daily survival and PvP conflicts will tend to transform Hope into Brutality, Cunning and Fear. Fear may seem at first like the win trait (you gain fear when you lose conflicts, and you can later play fear to win conflicts) but too much fear results in paralysis, starvation, sleeplessness: you must win a conflict pitting your own Hope against your own Fear to act in the face of terror, to forage for food, and to sleep soundly. So characters will have a strong motive for keeping their Fear score low. This said, the total number of poker chips in play will nevertheless increase over the course of the game, gradually increasing the size of the average hand.<br/><br/><b>Social Interaction:</b> there are two distinct forms of social interaction in the game: friendship and subservience.<br/><br/>Friends exchange secrets. The secret (and the corresponding mutual vulnerability) defines the friendship. This trust means that if friends are on the same side in a conflict, they can look at each others\u2019 hands before the conflict, and even exchange cards on a 1-for-1 basis. If you reveal your friend\u2019s secret, take up to two Hope from your friend and place the chips on Cunning or Brutality. Your friend takes an equal number of your Fear chips and adds them to his own Fear stack. Betrayal ends the friendship and ends your friend\u2019s power over you. <br/><br/>The master/minion relationship is defined by Tribute and Patronage. The underling pays Tribute to his master out of his Hope stack. The master commences his relationship with his minion with a demand for tribute; the demand generally accompanies an order to do something, and further tribute can be exacted at any time. The master holds Tribute in a stack separate from his traits; he can add in Tribute when calculating the # cards he receives in a conflict, so long as his minions are present when the conflict begins (regardless of whether the minons participate). In addition, for every chip of Tribute held, the master can distribute 2 chips of Patronage to his minions. Minions can use Patronage in place of Hope on rolls, and can add Patronage to Brutality on rolls. The master can withdraw Patronage from a minion at any time and redistribute it to other minions; this is not considered a betrayal unless the Master specifically ends the relationship. For their part, minions can end the relationship at any time by turning on and threatening their master. But doing so does not recover the Tribute they have paid, but only transforms it into Fear held by the master. Note that, as with friendship, there\u2019s an advantage to being the first to betray: if the master strikes first, the minion can only transform half his Tribute into Fear; if the minion strikes first, the master can only withdraw half his Patronage from the minion.<br/><br/>This is a lot to read over. I\u2019d hoped to condense it more, but I find that the magic is in the details of how the traits interact, and in how social relationships interact with traits and conflict rolls.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233522/#Comment_233522" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T14:51:53+00:00" title="September 21, 2009  2:51PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get a big <img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/> on for mechanics like these.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you played them?

The relationship mechanics less so, as I was having trouble getting players to actively pursue master/servant relationships\u2014a big reason why I reworked the game as Lord of the Flies rather than buccaneering pirates. The friendship mechanic is entirely new. Hoping to run a playtest later this week at StoryGames Boston, but if the people agree to run it\u2019ll be generous on their part, since they playtested an earlier iteration last week. <br/><br/>If you\u2019re interested, let me know and I\u2019ll send you the full writeup (which would include more details on the conflict mechanic).                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233543/#Comment_233543" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T17:56:28+00:00" title="September 21, 2009  5:56PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a source of inspiration I'd strongly recommend looking up some info on the Standford Prison Experiments.

Any ideas on the in-game effects of a bad's night sleep, hunger, or fear-stricken paralysis? I figure there needs to be some reason to do these things - otherwise, I could just say "so what? So I'm starving." I think I'd need to see the friendship mechanics in action, as well - relationship maps and such would really help connect me to the action at the beginning of the game. <br/><br/>It does sound really cool, though. Lord of the Rings was one of my favorite books, growing up.<br/><br/>I think I could really see the game a lot better with an AP post, if you have any, as well ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233562/#Comment_233562" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T21:53:24+00:00" title="September 21, 2009  9:53PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2009 11:51PM by Nathan_H.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe you are indeed trampling the Fruitful Void, at least with the first post.<br/>Have you played Mafia/Werewolf?<br/>I think it may work much better using the Lord(Friendship?)as a double-edged mechanic(like Humanity in Sorcerer/Devil in Dust Devils).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HiQKid" title="HiQKid"><img alt="HiQKid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HiQKid">HiQKid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233564/#Comment_233564" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T22:43:16+00:00" title="September 21, 2009 10:43PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I gotta say, Chuck, that despite enjoying last week's game, there's alot more depth here.

If your design would benefit from having a fruitful void then the various fruitful void discussions will help you understand how to ensure you have one.

As occurred with prior versions of the game, the players didn\u2019t explore the rules for social dynamics, but busied themselves with doing stuff using the task resolution mechanics. In retrospect, I realized that the GM needs to actively push the players to socialize by setting stakes where the result of failing in a task is some version of \u201cyou need help.\u201d Thus, the GM should say: \u201cThe fruit\u2019s too high, and the tree\u2019s trunk too smooth. Maybe if you could get someone to give you a boost, you could reach that first branch, and then climb up from there.\u201d Or \u201cThe buzzing sound grows ominously louder as you start to enter the cave. Your hair stands on end. Your heart beats wildly. You dash away, terrified. Maybe if you came back with someone else, you could brave the terrors of this cave.\u201d<br/><br/>Some of the time, of course, I should resolve failure as success with a penalty (as in Mouse Guard and other games).<br/><br/>And for minor tasks I really need to unlearn habits from running traditional rpgs and learn to say \u201cYes.\u201d The trouble is that while playing I didn\u2019t have a clear sense of what tasks should be routine and which ones should require a roll. To force a roll to forage for food makes sense early in the game when the characters are learning their way about the island, but not later on. On the other hand, food is such a necessity that a failed foraging roll should be resolved as success with penalty\u2014otherwise failure leads to an infinite series of repeated attempts.<br/><br/>I\u2019m toying with the thought of adding a checklist of basic necessities to the character sheet. As characters master each challenge (how best to forage for fruit and veggies, build a shelter, hunt for meat, fashion something to signal for rescue, invent recreational play, etc.) they get a check so that they would no longer have to roll for that necessity on a daily basis. This would give players a clearer sense of what they ought to be dong. <br/><br/>Alternatively, I might place a different \u201cbadge\u201d in the table\u2019s center, describing the mood of the NPC crowd. \u201cHungry\u201d \u201cCold and Wet\u201d \u201cScared\u201d \u201cBored\u201d etc. Players who master these tasks might gain followers or popularity.<br/><br/>The trouble is that the more pre-scripted I go, the more the game becomes a closed system like a boardgame. I had hoped to create an open system, a storygame rpg. And any effort to track popularity of the PCs with the NPCs might make the game more and more one of mechanisms and not open interaction.<br/><br/>I was also unhappy with the system for conflict resolution, but I will save that question for a separate post. For the moment, I\u2019d like to get responses to the idea that the problems I\u2019ve been having in getting characters to enter into social pacts can be fixed by pushing social pacts as the means to overcome failures on crucial tasks. And, in addition, the notion that creating a list of crucial tasks will help focus players on challenges of surviving on an island.<br/><br/>Ralph, Nathan: I appreciate your discussion of fruitful voids. It\u2019s a vocabulary that\u2019s relatively new to me, and after reading around on the internet, I\u2019m still not quite sure if Vincent Baker\u2019s concept is identical with my own sense that creating a game mechanic focuses attention on the mechanic and distracts from the logic implicit in the story as it unfolds collectively.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234264/#Comment_234264" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-25T12:36:40+00:00" title="September 25, 2009 12:36PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chuck I like the direction your thoughts are going.  Maybe you can tie all of these things together.<br/><br/>So you have some basic needs that need to be met.  If you go off and do it yourself you can meet these needs irregularly and for only a limited time.  You can forage for food by your self, but tomorrow you'll be hungry again and your foraging only provided enough for a couple of days...at this stage make the players roll continuously and make failure be of the "you are hungry suffer a penalty" nature.  I'm a fan of using mechanics that help the players feel like their characters so if the rolls become tedious and frustrating after awhile...IMO...that's a good thing.  Because foraging for food should be a tedious and frustrating activity.<br/><br/>BUT...basic needs can be met longer term with organization.  Get an organized group of foragers, hunter, planter / harvesters and you'll be able to reliably provide a source of food for a larger number of people.  Now you no longer need to forage for food.  But...you can't get there without engaging the social mechanics.  Use the social mechanics to build an organized food gathering effort and as long as you're plugged into that system you don't have to make foraging rolls any more.<br/><br/>You can look to Mouse Guard and its conditions for ideas here.  In Mouse Guard failure can (at the GM's option) be interpreted as success, but with a penalty.  The penalty being taking a Condition like "angry", "tired", "hungry/thirsty" (which for your purposes would likely be two seperate conditions), "sick", or "injured".  To get rid of these conditions you have to make a roll specific to that condition.  If you're on your own, the roll is of the tedious / annoying variety.  If you're part of a group, it uses the social mechanics instead.<br/><br/>You might also look to Poison'd and its Special Conditions (I think that's what they're called).  They are essentially obstacles that are put in play (like the ship needs repairs or the crew is hungry or they're pissed off or the British Navy is on the horizon) by writing them on index cards and putting them out on the table.  If they're ignored various effects are suffered, if they're dealt with the effect is avoided or turned off.  That would be another easy way to focus play on the social mechanics as you can design situations that are simply not able to be solved by 1 person acting alone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234266/#Comment_234266" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-25T12:49:21+00:00" title="September 25, 2009 12:49PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>You might also look to Poison'd and its Special Conditions</blockquote>\nThey're "Cruel Fortunes."
