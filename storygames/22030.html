In D&amp;D, it\u2019s pretty quick to <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/almost_catching_up/" rel="nofollow">almost catch up</a> in a mixed level party, and if everyone died we all get to have that low-level fun again. D&amp;D is set up so that it\u2019s really really hard to survive the first few levels and really really hard to die after a while. In some environments, level 1 and 2 are <em>really</em> dangerous so for some campaigns I like the (house) rule that once everyone\u2019s in the party\u2019s been level 3, level 3 becomes the new baseline. You may start at level 1 or 2 if you wish but with the XP you need to go to 3. In some other environments I\u2019m like \u201cthere\u2019s plenty of things for level ones to do around here\u201d and that\u2019s where you go. This is something we usually decide up front for the campaign.</p><p>Right now we\u2019re running a module where it says explicitly \u201cA replacement character should be the same level as the rest of the party\u201d. The pro of that is that even though this module is one of the biggest sandboxes I\u2019ve ran outside of aQ [no, not because of the \u201csand\u201d pun, but because of the thoroughness of the 2e boxes], they can say \u201cwho cares about the maguffin, let\u2019s take up life as pirates!\u201d or w/e (there\u2019s even a whole <em>other</em> level 1-16 campaign going on separately in another of the ruined cities here), the module also has a schtick that prevents resurrection magic from working and if they want to make headway towards the maguffin [again, the module doesn\u2019t funnel them there, but they are strongly motivated to try to find it, go there, and do something about it], starting over would\u2019ve been hopeless.</p><p>I also interpreted \u201cthe same level\u201d as the party\u2019s <em>highest</em> level which was a mistake. Lowest or average or median would\u2019ve been better.</p><h2 id="same-level">Same level</h2><p><em>(Either party\u2019s highest level, party\u2019s average level, party\u2019s lowest level)</em></p><ul><li>Makes it so that sometimes the best way to advance is to die, unless you go \u201cparty\u2019s lowest level\u201d</li><li>Makes it possible (too easy?) to pursue high level goals &amp; maguffins</li><li>Makes it easier to be level-appropriate</li><li>Can come up with more elaborate backstory. \u201cOh mad one!

You can give away XP to other players (most likely for the purps of you want them to level up faster than you, maybe if you\u2019re ahead of them) as long as they haven\u2019t received more \u201cgift\u201d XP than they had earned normally. I.e. a party of Bob, Carol, Ted and Alice gets 200 xp each. Ted gives Alice 100xp more from his own share. Alice couldn\u2019t receive more than 200 total as gifts this way until she earns more xp normally idk I\u2019m just brainstorming.</p><h2 id="about-gaining-more-levels-at-once">About \u201cgaining more levels at once\u201d</h2><p>I wanted to touch on the \u201cGaining more levels at once\u201d; many version of D&amp;D has a rule that if you were to gain more more XP than you need to go to the next level, the excess XP is lost. I guess for when you find a ginormous treasure trove and use XP for treasure system. That rule is not in 5e (and I\u2019m not about to houserule it back in, I don\u2019t like the rule), but if you\u2019re using a version that has that rule, here\u2019s how I\u2019d tweak it: the rule would only apply to people going to a level beyond the party\u2019s currently highest level.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482163/#Comment_482163" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-20T06:27:39+00:00" title="April 20, 2019  6:27AM">April 20</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2019 6:28AM by 2097.">edited April 20</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I forgot to say that <b>for guest characters they do start at the party level</b>.

Either go by playing time (count hours or sessions or w/e, never tried anything like that though) or do full XP.</p><p>A lot of problems that other DMs report, such as fudging dice or hp, or players getting angry b/c TPK, or DMs getting frustrated b/c they can\u2019t challenge the players, go away in a sandbox because you\u2019re no longer serving up the encounters to them. They seek out the encounters themselves (no, not in a \u201cCzege principle\u201d violating way but by going out in the Dangerous Forest) and it becomes an economic game. \u201cHow much Level do we need before we can go to Area?\u201d becomes the recurring question. And their player skill, ingenuity in bypassing monsters, their luck on encounter tables, their builds etc all become super relevant.</p><p>When DM serves out the levels to suit the (upcoming) encounters, that\u2019s almost as bad as the DM serving out the encounters to suit the player\u2019s levels. You become reliant on challenge ratings or fudging or whatever, or if you refuse those things (which I do) you deserve the ire of the players when things go wrong. If you served the dish, you\u2019re accountable for the recipe. If they serve themselves, by being in control of both their own opposition (through where they go or who they make enemies with) and their abilities (through earning experience), everyone can just eat to their own liking and have a good time.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>My old school sandboxes start guest players at 1st level as well.

If she gets into more regular D&amp;D (she\u2019s played with us like four times, with about a year between occasions) that\u2019d be another thing.

There weren't firm rules for it at that point, but I seem to remember something very gygaxian about not awarding XP for "non-challenging" adventures, or something of the sort. It's an old DM worry - what to do if the players play over-leveled characters and trivialize the adventure that way.<br/><br/>The WotC 3rd edition, on the other hand, has explicit rules for how a character's XP gains get prorated: there's a table that you use to correlate a monster's CR (you basically only get XP for monster-slaying in 3rd) with the adventurer's level, and if the adventurer's level is higher than the monster's CR, then that monster's not as valuable. For example, a 4th level character gets 600 xp for a CR 2 monster, while an 8th level character gets just 300. The hilarious part is that in an encounter with multiple adventurers and multiple monsters (not very uncommon, that) you're supposed to reference the table for each adventurer-monster pair separately, which can be a bit of work I imagine.<br/><br/>If I were to DM 3rd edition in a more old school style (for a reason I can't quite fathom right now), with sandboxes and character stables and all, I would actually use that devaluation rule despite its ugliness; 3rd edition XP tables have very weak inherent inflation compared to the geometric series used in 20th century D&amp;D, which means that low-level characters don't catch up to high-level ones on their own. It's actually a very different design compared to the original, math-wise.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I don't recommend stacking multiple layers of rules for fine-tuning something like XP awards. Either every level-up costs 1000 XP (or whatever) no matter your level, but it's more difficult to gain points at higher levels, or you do something like Gygax and halve the value of the individual point every level by demanding more and more of them as you go up. Either way works, but combining them together is pretty dim, I think; a good example of the fake complexity that guides modern D&amp;D design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482185/#Comment_482185" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-20T20:17:54+00:00" title="April 20, 2019  8:17PM">April 20</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2019 8:19PM by 2097.">edited April 20</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>In some way, my remix of the <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/three-pillars-xp-revisited/" rel="nofollow">three pillars XP system</a> does use something like that.

I don't think that it's entirely obvious, and I think that you need specific techniques of play to achieve the ideal, but in certain editions of Basic you hardly need to worry about adventures being "too easy to count". Apparently it's a phenomenon that became a concern for D&amp;D authors at some point, but to me it seems like the cure is sometimes worse than the disease.<br/><br/>The key mechanical issues in having a D&amp;D where low-level dangers aren't <i>too</i> easy for higher-level characters are the existence or non-existence of critical hits and/or fumbles and whether AC has hard limits. (Consider this: original D&amp;D basically doesn't have AC scaling at all - a mid-level character adventures with the same armor a 1st-leveler does.)<br/><br/>A D&amp;D where lower-level adventures are still potentially dangerous to higher-level characters doesn't need too much in the way of penalties for being over-leveled: the natural penalty of a low-level adventure not being worth that many points is enough, as the character takes a real risk in participating in the adventure anyway. If you're going to risk your neck, you should do it for an amount of points that might help you level up.<br/><br/>In my own sandboxes I make a point of fine-tuning the rules in such a way that low-level adventures are the best choice for low-level adventurers and mid-level adventures are the best choice for mid-level adventurers. This is pretty simple to achieve as long as you manage two things:<br/><b>*</b> A mid-level character can still die in a low-level adventure because the combat system is sufficiently lethal and uncertain. Doesn't need to be as likely as it is for a low-level character, but it has to be a concern.<br/><b>*</b> Mid-level adventures have better payouts, but there are gate-keeping concerns that tend to keep low-level adventurers out: expeditions to mid-level locations are more expensive, or only reputable adventurers with the right contacts can get the hook.<br/><br/>If both of those are true, then a mid-level adventurer shouldn't be slumming it out with low-levelers too much: a more valuable character should be doing a better class of adventure altogether.<br/><br/>A pro tip: D&amp;D traditionally has dungeon features that are dangerous to higher level characters as well; not everything scales neatly, and some things simply scale pretty slowly. The absolutely simplest way to ensure that low-level dungeons are too dangerous for a valuable character is to scatter a liberal amount of poisonous save-or-die snakes everywhere. That's the sort of place where you'd rather pay a poor 1st level bastard to delve so you don't have to go there yourself.<br/><br/>In general I'm of the opinion that here, as well as in other places in the D&amp;D chassis, the designer is best served by reducing the ever-creeping idea of numbers advancement. D&amp;D has at its core the wonderfully powerful concept of the Hit Point pool, which already grows linearly as characters advance and makes leveled characters extremely robust and therefore effective. I am uncertain whether there are <i>any</i> numbers in the resolution system that need to grow on top of that, or if it's all just fake progress.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482189/#Comment_482189" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-20T21:01:38+00:00" title="April 20, 2019  9:01PM">April 20</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agree completely.<br/><br/>This was a problem that 3e/PF exacerbated and that 4E took to a ridiculous degree.

By the time characters got to level 4-5 I would start saying things to myself like "This combat encounter is so long and it doesn't really feel like the characters are even in danger". I attributed it to 5e giving characters and monsters to much HP but I think that's baloney now. For one thing I could have had the players roll for their HP and I chose not to. I was also doing things like only stocking dungeons with "level appropriate" monsters. And even worse I stopped rolling for random encounters because I was so tired of these endless combat sequences where nothing seemed to be at stake. Of course that snowballed because without the random encounters they basically walked into static encounters with all of their resources and just brushed through them.<br/><br/>The thing I latched onto when reading stuff like B/X or LL is that a red dragon has about 40hp and I said "Aha! I this is the secret to fast and exciting combat!" Of course that doesn't make any sense because the damage dealt in those games are relatively scaled down as well (is it proportional? I have no idea).<br/><br/>Anyway things are going better this time around with my current game but there is still plenty of room for improvement.

Basically the opposite of what D&amp;D5 does: as you level up, you get better at doing all kinds of things, but you only become less fragile very gradually. The most you can end up with in terms of hit points is about 3x the starting amount (so, a "high-level" character in my version of D&amp;D is like a more competent and skilled 3rd level character in normal D&amp;D - somewhere in the realm of a 10th level 5E character in terms of aptitude but with the hit points of a 3rd-level character).<br/><br/>My hope is that it keeps the game exciting and avoids that "slugfest" effect D&amp;D can sometimes have.

If you fight what the DMG says is a reasonable number of skeletons in a day, which is 48 skeletons for a party of four level 4 characters (eight per fight, two fights per short rest, three such periods per day), an AC increase of one point is the equivalent of an increase of twelve hp. If you're at level eight and are fighting the prescribed amount of 24 skeletons per fight, 144 per day, an AC increase of one point is instead the equivalent of an increase of 36 hp. So as you can see the scaling, when scaling AC rather than HP, is non linear. That's why it's better to scale HP than to scale AC.<br/><br/>Another argument in favor of having AC bound tighter than HP is because you get bigger &amp; bigger AoE spells that hit more and more targets.<br/><br/>(Again, as you know, I don't serve up "prescribed amounts of skeletons"; I run a world and there are monsters in it that the players have their characters stumble upon or seek out. This is just to show some of the math probs with AC.)<br/><br/>It's the equiv argument of "why can't there be giant humans and giant bugs" well because mass increase at a different rate than area as you go up in size.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482226/#Comment_482226" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-21T07:34:05+00:00" title="April 21, 2019  7:34AM">April 21</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2019 7:34AM by Paul_T.">edited April 21</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, sure.

That's true, yes. But... either I am too tired or you're twisting my brain around. Wouldn't these numbers depend on the expected number of monsters and attacks, as well as the typical damage output?<br/><br/>For example, if you're fighting 100+ skeletons per day, as you suggest, HP can be adjusted in a more subtle fashion. But if the numbers are smaller (like they are in a B/X or OD&amp;D context), then the reverse seems to be true - a 5% difference to-hit can be a smaller effect than an extra hit point.<br/><br/>And does this matter, in any case? Why is this important? For instance, we could scale up all damage and hit point numbers by a factor of 10, and thereby get even finer granularity.  Or we could roll percentile dice instead a d20 to hit. Does either of those somehow improve the game for us? <br/><br/>Maybe I'm just being slow, of course.<br/><br/>You're saying that AC modifiers scale differently that hit point modifiers (ok!), but I'm not sure how that gets us to "it's better to scale HP than to scale AC". What criteria are we using to judge "better"? And what's the potential failure point here? What could go wrong?<br/><br/>The only one I'm aware of is the problem where one side can't hit the other at all (a la GURPS), which doesn't happen if we tend to favour increasing chances "to hit" instead of AC bonuses - at worst they just both hit each other all the time, which I'd imagine is ok (works great in Into the Odd, after all! - and the random damage still keeps things uncertain). <br/><br/>The math makes some sense here but I'm not sure where you're heading with this in the long term, in other words.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482234/#Comment_482234" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-21T09:44:49+00:00" title="April 21, 2019  9:44AM">April 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Well, heaven knows I\u2019ve fucked up math things before so I\u2019m not sure.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019m just unconsciously doing the old \u201cblast processing\u201d schtick rn of defending 5e\u2019s design choices no matter what.</p><p>\u201cBetter\u201d = easier &amp; more obvious for DMs, module writers &amp; game / class / monster designers.</p><p>The skeletons chance to-hit isn\u2019t going up right?

This should help with party composition (and has other interesting effects I think).<br/><br/>Short-term, we plan on uniting all PCs into a giant stable - introduce them to each other, so to speak - so the name-levels might perhaps remove the roadbloack in Dyson's Delve etc. (but not get involved any further because - as Eero points out - continually risking high-level characters in adventures beneath them is a losing proposition).<br/><br/>Additionally, I think we also need to adjust expectations (and possibly the design) of high-level quests. I think it is unrealistic to expect everyone to have a name-level character at the same time. I think a mere two or three name-level characters should form the nucleus of a party for serious quests (with everyone else playing low-level extras who quickly gain a few levels if they are lucky enough to not get caught in area effects like fireball or trample attacks).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482263/#Comment_482263" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-21T21:50:58+00:00" title="April 21, 2019  9:50PM">April 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your conclusions are very similar to mine, Johann - and let me say that it's a pleasure to hear about how lethal, sandboxy and stable-y your campaign is becoming; I find these to be high virtues. I am also amazed that you're tackling the Giant series with 6th level characters [grin].<br/><br/>I am very much in favour of unevenly leveled parties, and I am also in favour of doing the exact things you're doing as a group: exploring the strategic battlespace, leveling up characters, filling up the rosters and finding the approachs that work for you. So as far as I'm concerned, anything's cool here. It would be a shame to lose track of the original high-level adventure skein you were following, but so far it seems that you have the overall picture well in hand.<br/><br/>Using a higher-level character as a battering ram to level up some weaklings is an excellent approach to leveraging a developed campaign to my mind. My religious relationship to starting at 1st level shouldn't be mistaken for some sort of desire to have the campaign remain low-level for all time; I just think that players should approach the problem holistically and solve it with the resources at their disposal rather than just give out free XP.<br/><br/>I am of the mind that generally speaking a 5th level character should be well able to seize leadership in a 1st level group and take them through some low-level dungeons. Maybe a few die on the way, but it's unlikely for the leader to die, and as long as rewarding adventures continue to be found, it'll be no time at all until those 1st-levelers are 3rd level, and then a bit after that 5th - at which point the 5th-leveler is level 6 himself, and the party is solidly mid-level. And it presumably doesn't take 20 sessions, as it seems to take us when starting from zero, thanks to the presence of the mid-level battering ram.<br/><br/>Alternatively, as you say, a firm core of mid-levelers can just take a bunch of no-level newbs into a mid-level adventure with them as redshirts. Sure, half may die on the way, but any that survive even a shorter adventure are sure to hit 2nd level even on a meager share of the spoils. They'll grow or die rather quickly even just squiring for their betters. You might consider doubling the number of entrant redshirts by having the players with name level characters run some share-eating retainer NPCs on the side; get more redshirts than just the number of players into it, and you improve the chances of even some surviving. You can then turn those heretofore-generic 2nd level retainers into player characters later as necessary.<br/><br/>Or, consider the opposite, hands-off approach: why not have the surviving high-levelers figure out some low-level questing that needs doing, and have them hire new low-level adventurers to do it? A higher-level character will presumably encounter trouble and adventure that they are motivated to address but don't want to do themselves. They can finance a lower-level party, improving its chances, and the reward money they offer is XP-worthy same as any (if NPC rewards are XP worthy, of course - some campaigns have only dungeon treasure count for that, I hear). Adult players will of course keep the financing and rewards to realistic and reasonable levels, the metagaming possibility is rather impossible to miss. Still, a juicy adventure hook with solid financing and a reward on top isn't something to ignore when you're 1st level.<br/><br/>The thing I like about this sort of campaign approach the most is the variety: instead of running through the GM's string-of-pearls, or even just managing our own rise through a sandbox, we're doing a varied tapestry of play. Getting some characters to high levels doesn't mean abandoning the low-level shenanigans, it just means adding all kinds of weird variations into the mix. It's rather obvious in my experience that a high-level adventurer will necessarily develop their own undergrowth of lower level concerns that require the players to play stuff at all levels rather than just aiming higher and higher all the time.<br/><br/>And yeah, I am with you on the possible need to rethink what high level adventures even are like. I am unwilling to commit to a stance at this time due to not having sufficient experience with high level D&amp;D, but my initial feel is that the nature of the adventures should probably change more radically than they do in the textual tradition; your average TSR high level module may not be as true and legitimate to real implications of the wargaming as I'd like. A topic for another time, preferably after we get a campaign to the lofty heights of the Giants series ourselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482268/#Comment_482268" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-21T22:08:24+00:00" title="April 21, 2019 10:08PM">April 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A question I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on (aimed at everyone!):<br/><br/>What if \u201cstarting\u201d an adventure had diegetic consequences? <br/><br/>In other words, we know what happens when you \u201cfinish\u201d an adventure: maybe you slay the monster, clear out the dungeon, and return with wealth and magic.

The adventure starts living its own life after it's been "activated" in the campaign. This generally happens when the PCs start experiencing it, but even just blatantly ignoring a very specific adventure hook might do it: once I've established that there's a lich living thataway, it's just going to be a matter of time before the lich dungeon <i>does</i> something.<br/><br/>This is all the more true if the adventurers actually visit the adventure, even in a superficial fashion. As an example of how far this sort of thing can go, I once GMed the very first scene of the mid-level AA12, "The Barrow Mound of Gravemoor" to our group. After the party abandoned the adventure (they were clearly looking for a softer target), well, it just so happens that this particular adventure revolves around a wight with a necromantic artifact - so the wight did as a wight does, and lo and behold, later on the Italian Wars (the campaign was set in 14th century Northern Italy at that point, pretty much) had a new participant in the form of an undead army rampaging about. The original adventure design was the direct implication here: it's very clear about the goals and modus operandi of the villain, everything is going to go to hell relatively quickly of nobody delves the Barrow Mound. The PCs started seriously combating the threat at this point, which lead to a delightful campaign arc as they stole the treasury of Milan (by then thoroughly zombie-infested hellscape), fought in various pitched battles against the undead threat, had their own mercenary company contract ghoulism (subtly memetically infectious in that campaign) and so on.<br/><br/>You never know how safe it is to leave a situation be. Some other adventure locations can be perfectly static, there's nothing "going on" aside from some inconsequential dungeon ecology reshuffling as monster A eats monster B and monster C moves in from the countryside.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ebear" title="ebear"><img alt="ebear" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ebear">ebear</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482278/#Comment_482278" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-22T01:07:33+00:00" title="April 22, 2019  1:07AM">April 22</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Yeah, thanks for reading my rambling charitably\u2665</p><p>When I come across as harsh about things such as fudging or milestone XP it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been burned by those things myself.

I got really burnt out and eventually suggested everyone switch to Dungeon World, which actually went pretty well for everyone and was a much better fit for what we were actually doing.

I personally consider this the nature of the transformation from low-level play to mid-level play: as the adventurers uncork various adventures and their consequences (whether the players engage the adventure or leave it bubbling) start piling up, and the adventurers experience the setting in general and learn about it, an overall strategic theater of operations emerges.

The "Bounded Accuracy" restriction only works as a method of flattening power accumulation if all other variables are the same and they're really not: from Levels 1 to 10, the mean difficulty curve (as a metric of increased DPR output and incoming DPR mitigation) of a 4E monster is approximately 18% per +1 level whereas from CR 1 to CR 10 the mean difficulty curve of a 5E monster is approximately 25% per +1 CR. So, contrary to popular opinion and 5E marketing spin, 5E monsters actually have a steeper power curve than 4E monsters.<br/><br/>The issue is that running 65+ low-level monsters as an encounter is pretty boring and shitty no matter what system you're using. The fact the 5E monster has a 25% chance to hit while the 4E monster has a 10% chance to hit is largely irrelevant here: they're both still missing the overwhelming majority of the time and the only chance they have to take the PCs is through sheer numbers and the law of averages. 4E simply offers a more fun and reasonable alternative: re-contextualize the lower-level monster in a different category. This is really only possible because 4E monsters' XP curve matches up with the difficulty curve (whereas 5E's XP curve is almost twice its difficulty curve).<br/><br/>Also, the 4E DMG recommends using monsters up to 6 levels below and 4 levels above the player characters. That's an 11-level span here. The idea you need to "re-scale" the world every couple levels is largely bunk.<br/><br/>Trent                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482302/#Comment_482302" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-22T14:33:49+00:00" title="April 22, 2019  2:33PM">April 22</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><small>Hi Trent! 4E isn\u2019t all bad!

A Fighter's actual attack bonus curve in 3E/PF is closer to +1.5 to +2 per level. 4E scaled the attack bonus curve way back  compared to 3E.

Rather, my point is that 4e is often misrepresented in these types of discussions. What I'm doing is correcting misinformation about what I play, not trying to tell anyone what they should or should not play. I just want to make that clear.<br/><br/>The issue with the mathematical analysis you're making is you are not taking into account the full array of numerical values that comprise a character's efficacy in combat: attack bonus, defense value, hit points, and average damage all combine to determine a creature's outgoing DPR as well as their ability to mitigate incoming DPR. You're just looking at attack bonus in a vacuum. So, yes, while a 4e monster's attack bonus goes up by +1 per level vs the 5e monster's +1/2 per CR (or, as I would put it more usefully in this discussion, a +8% increase in DPR vs a +4% increase in DPR approximately), the 4e monster's hit points only go up +8 per level vs the 5e monster's increase of +15 per CR and the 4e monster's damage only goes up by +1 per level vs the 5e monster's +3 per CR.<br/><br/>If you take the average stats of a CR1 through CR10 monster and factor in the increase in DPR output afforded by attack bonus and damage and average that with the increase in DPR mitigation afforded by AC and hit point gain, you get a mean difficulty curve of about +25% from CR n to CR n+1. If you do the same for XP values (comparing the difference between n and n+1), you will find a mean XP curve of +48% which is why I say the difficulty curve does not match up with the XP curve --- there is a reason 5e's encounter building rules are notorious for being ridiculously easy on the players.<br/><br/>If you do the same for a 4e monster and compare a level 1 through level 10 monster, you will get a mean difficulty curve of about +18% from level n to level n+1 and a mean XP curve of, shockingly, +18% from level n to level n+1. Now, the figures for both of these are of course simply statistical averages and the difficulty curve for both games is sharper at the first few levels and become progressively less sharp at higher levels.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is somewhat beside the point. In both 4e and 5e you need somewhere in the ballpark of 10 to 15 CR1/L1 monsters per 9th level PC to defeat the party. And, while yes the 5e CR1 has about a 20% better chance to hit they are still no more of a threat than a 4e L1 is because 5e expects a +24 damage difference between CR1 and CR9 whereas 4e expects a +8 damage difference between Lvl1 and Lvl9.<br/><br/>I hope I'm explaining my reasoning here well. I have a feeling I'm not communicating my points very clearly... something my math students can well attest to! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(I'll try to remember the number-E vs number-e issue in the future.)<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482315/#Comment_482315" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-22T17:01:00+00:00" title="April 22, 2019  5:01PM">April 22</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2019 5:01PM by Trent_W.">edited April 22</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>So you\u2019re still saying 5e did a thing that I (Sandra) likes\u2014binding accuracy tight af\u2014better than any other edition?

I was addressing the point that 4e had a sharper attack bonus curve than 3e. It does not and actually scaled back 3e's curve almost as much as 5e scaled back 4e's curve.<br/><br/>A weapon attack bonus in 4e can be as high as +38 (although only a Fighter and Rogue can attain this by virtue of their class features) and an implement attack can be as high as +34. Although again, this is misleading as 4e has maximum level of 30th level. A more meaningful comparison would be to look at the attack bonus curve of each respective game which yields the +1.5x, +1x, and +0.5x values I indicated earlier.<br/><br/>Its important to note that 4e's attack bonus curve (as a measure of probability not raw numbers) is more similar to pre-WotC versions of D&amp;D as well. Both 3e and 5e are kind of the outliers here.<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482321/#Comment_482321" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-22T19:06:50+00:00" title="April 22, 2019  7:06PM">April 22</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" rel="nofollow">Trent_W</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>[\u2026]nor do I think it particularly \u201cimproved\u201d upon 4e in regards to monster design and encounter building rules[\u2026]What I\u2019m doing is correcting misinformation about what I play, not trying to tell anyone what they should or should not play.</p></div></blockquote><p>OK, but the brief mention that I made of 4E in a post featuring on a diagram that I, myself, three minutes later noted was wrong because it didn\u2019t note ASI\u2019s is not ground for you to say outright insulting things like</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" rel="nofollow">Trent_W</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>haven\u2019t critically scrutinized some of 5e\u2019s more questionable marketing claims.</p></div></blockquote><p>and</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" rel="nofollow">Trent_W</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>The issue with the mathematical analysis you\u2019re making is you are not taking into account the full array of numerical values that comprise a character\u2019s efficacy in combat: attack bonus, defense value, hit points, and average damage all combine to determine a creature\u2019s outgoing DPR as well as their ability to mitigate incoming DPR.

I read the thread over the weekend so I may not have seen the more recent posts and was trying to hammer out a response before my students came in this morning.<br/><br/>I think its important to point that I am not directly addressing *your* game but rather the 5e rules as written. I understand you have drifted pretty afar from the 5e text in many important respects. I also don't use the 4e Rules Compendium (don't own it) but the DMG1 and DMG2 as my resources (but I do own the Monster Vault and do use the updated post-MM3 monster math). In practice I would limit monsters from n-4 to n+2 in my own games, which is a solid 7-level span (well over half a tier and nearly 1/4 of the entire game's content).  <br/><br/>Yes, by difficulty I am referring to a mean of DPR output + DPR mitigation. I'm not sure where you are getting some of your numbers from. Here's how my math worked out:<br/><br/>Monsters Kill PCs: A typical 5e 9th level PC (assuming Con 14) will have approximately 19 AC and 66 hp, whereas a CR1 will have +4 to hit and deal 5 damage per round. This yields 66/(0.3 x 5) = 44 rounds to kill. By contrast, a typical 9th level 4e PC will also have 66 hp but an AC 24 vs a L1's +6 to hit and 9 damage per round. This yields 66/(0.15 x 9) = 49 rounds to kill. If we want to cap our encounter duration to 4 rounds (since nobody wants a 40+ round battle), that gives us 11 CR1s and 12 L1s per L9 PC, respectively. Keep in mind I am not factoring in the many ways monsters can get bonuses to hit in 4E (flanking and charging, for example) nor am I factoring in 4e monsters' various recharge and encounter powers (their effective damage per round is *really* 9 x 1.125 in a 4-6 round fight) which would increase their DPR even further. Near as I can tell, they're about equally dangerous offensively in both editions despite 5e's bounded accuracy.<br/><br/>PCs Kill Monsters: A typical 9th level 5e warrior type has a +9 to hit and deals 20 damage per round with both attacks (not counting special abilities or features here) vs a CR1's AC 13 and 15 hp. This yields 15/(0.85 x 20) = 0.9 rounds to kill, or approximately 1.1 dead monsters per round. By contrast, a typical 9th level 4e warrior has +15 to hit and deals 15 at-will damage per round vs a L1's 32 hp and AC 15.  This yields 32/(0.95 x 15) = 2.2 rounds to kill, or approximately 0.5 dead monsters per round. Of course, again, we're not factoring in special abilities from the PCs which may change things up (the "nova rounds" you mention before). From what I can tell, the 4e L1 has a slight edge here due to higher hp totals.<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482335/#Comment_482335" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-22T21:11:57+00:00" title="April 22, 2019  9:11PM">April 22</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" rel="nofollow">Trent_W</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Hi Sandra <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> , I apologize for the curtness of my earlier posts.

I messed up my math. The CR1 should have 30 hp and 10 damage with the same attack bonus and AC. My bad. So, with that in mind....<br/><br/>Monsters Kill PC: 66/(0.3 \xd7 10) = 22 rounds to kill, or approximately 5.5 monsters per PC for a 4-round encounter.<br/><br/>PC Kills Monsters: 30/(0.85 \xd7 20) = 1.8 rounds to kill, or approximately 0.6 dead monsters per round.<br/><br/>I just realized another error in my analysis, however, in that a CR1 is supposed to be a challenge for four L1 PCs. This would make it equivalent to a L1 Solo in 4e, not a L1 Standard. With that in mind, the CR1/4 is structurally equivalent to a L1 Standard like you said. So, yeah. <br/><br/>What struck me during my analysis is how similar both the CR1/4 and the L1 Standard are as threats to L9 PCs in their respective games, despite the very different mathematical assumptions of those editions.<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482344/#Comment_482344" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-22T21:55:53+00:00" title="April 22, 2019  9:55PM">April 22</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I am also amazed that you're tackling the Giant series with 6th level characters [grin].</p></div></blockquote>\nThat's not nearly as impressive as it sounds because we are using a heavily modified version of DCC -- let me put things into perspective:<br/><br/>(1) PCs are tougher than in OD&amp;D: bigger hit dice, 4d6-drop-lowest (though no ability score increases), roll twice for hp at 1st level. Not exactly pure OSR...<br/><br/>(2) DCC classes have a lot more firepower than OD&amp;D's. High-level fighters, for instance, score critical hits more often, use brutal critical hit tables, and can easily perform "mighty deeds" (i.e. hamstring, blind etc.).<br/><br/>(3) PCs can spend Luck (refilled upon gaining a new level), which is very handy for those situations when you absolutely need to land that hit (low levels) or make a save (name-level only).<br/><br/>Monsters also receive plenty of buffs when I convert them, but PCs clearly have the edge. I'd say the PCs effectively punch at a level roughly x1.5 or x2 their own compared to AD&amp;D.<br/><br/>Also, I typically double all treasure across the board. Combined with delving deeper earlier due to their firepower, the PCs level up very quickly. I'd estimate 2 sessions per current level to reach the next one (e.g. 2 sessions to get from 1st to 2nd). That's a tenth of the time you guys need... The PCs completed Barrowmaze I in about 50 sessions, making level 6 at the very end.<br/><br/>(Redshirt PCs in high-level parties level up even faster, though casualty rates are high and XP tend to be more chunky in higher level endeavours.)<br/><br/>I guess that makes me a bit of a Monty Haul DM, albeit a bloodthirsty one (i.e. all the fabulous prizes are covered in the viscera of the unlucky contestants).\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I am very much in favour of unevenly leveled parties, and I am also in favour of doing the exact things you're doing as a group: exploring the strategic battlespace, leveling up characters, filling up the rosters and finding the approachs that work for you.</p></div></blockquote>\nThat's a very heartening appraisal because I was starting to get worried.

Once the party had cleared out the upper levels of Dyson's Delve, for instance, I established a routine to have the manticores lower down move up every couple of months. The PCs took some detours, so the manticores eventually emerged from the dungeon and attacked the nearby village.<br/><br/>As for the "Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl", the party has not really 'activated' the adventure. Having established their own stronghold in "The Steading of the Hill Giant Chief" (and having defended it against a frost giant war party in our first military engagement) they are currently on a diplomatic mission to amazon tribes in the North to get intel on the frost giants.<br/><br/>The second party, established to create replacements via Dyson's Delve, was deliberately put in limbo regarding the campaign calendar, so as to make uniting it with the first party later easier. It doesn't feel quite right, but seeing how that second endeavour has snowballed to create new adventures, alliances and such, I'm at a loss regarding how to handle this. (Probably just bite the bullet and unite the parties and calendars and take it from there with some downtime / what-happens-at-your-stronghold-this-year tables.)<br/><br/>(It's also problematic that the NPC lord who called for adventurers to pacify Dyson's Delve is a rival/neighbor to the name-level PCs. If they come to blows with each other we'll run into continuity errors.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482346/#Comment_482346" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-22T22:11:27+00:00" title="April 22, 2019 10:11PM">April 22</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2019 10:12PM by 2097.">edited April 22</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Trent: But even when talking about CR 1/4 you would've had the party dead in six rounds. <br/><br/>You can't just do [MkP_rounds / PkM_rounds] even for one PC vs one monster.

you totally should use the 0th level character conceit here, then! That is, let the players start with four 0th level characters instead of a single 1st level character if they want to. (They would have to stable the extra ones when they hit 1st level, but as long as they're 0th you'd allow playing multiple PCs per player.) That's such an off-the-wall idea when applied to a sandbox that it'd be hilarious to see what happens. The DCC rules totally presume a string-of-pearls campaign structure (basically legit, but not as legit as sandbox, if you ask me) with the character funnel being used only for the campaign start, but that's such an excellent way of populating a character stable quickly... why not have four times the number of red-shirts to start with!<br/><br/>Just imagine the crew: e.g. three players playing four henchmen each, plus a few higher-level characters with say two retainers per head, plus whatever armsmen the party might have attracted... that's basically at my ideal low-level party size - the size of a football team and a half, that is.<br/><br/>Your campaign does sound a bit generous with the treasure, but that doesn't equal Monty Haul, philosophically speaking. A topic for another time no doubt, but let me say that while I dislike Monty Haul (the practice of artificial power pumping), I don't particularly mind the fact that some campaigns are more generous on advancement than others. My own seems to run at a hilariously high degree of difficulty, but I don't consider that to be some sort of ultimate virtue - playing more generously is fine, too, as long as it's not stupidly trivial Monty Haul generosity. Either way, I'd never be so crass as to critique another campaign's practices from the armchair - you'll need to invite me to play if you want me to judge your game like that [grin].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482361/#Comment_482361" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-22T23:33:56+00:00" title="April 22, 2019 11:33PM">April 22</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Sandra, I think you misunderstand me. I'm using the DPR calculations for the purpose of comparing the monsters' relative threat level across the two editions (which, from what I can tell, are pretty damn near the same despite 5E marketing suggesting otherwise). I don't actually suggest the numbers I've offered would make for good encounters or anything like that. It was just a cursory analysis of DPR input and output.<br/><br/>For one thing, "in the wild" L9 4e PCs have 3 encounter powers, 2 daily powers, 2 utility powers, and (a little over half the time) an action point at their disposal. 5e characters likewise have varying degrees of special powers and class features. A few well-placed area attacks would make short work out of our CR1/4 and L1 hordes. In actual practice, they're actually *less* threatening than the numbers are making them out to be (unless the party is totally bereft of AoEs or something like that).<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ebear" title="ebear"><img alt="ebear" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ebear">ebear</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482363/#Comment_482363" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-22T23:52:48+00:00" title="April 22, 2019 11:52PM">April 22</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>[...] The DCC rules totally presume a string-of-pearls campaign structure (basically legit, but not as legit as sandbox, if you ask me) [...]<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI'm soooo curious about this. I happen to like DCC a lot, and I'm a big fan of some of it's modules too. That said I've noticed that most of the modules have a sort of "the adventurers show up just as the cultists start hurling victims into the sacrifice pit" quality to them. Even the rooms tend to be laid out in a way that funnels the players in a particular direction. So I definitely see what you mean about assuming a string-of-pearls structure, the modules are definitely a clear window into that.<br/><br/>I guess what I wanted to know is do you see things about the core rules that would get in the way of sandbox play? From what I remember it's kind of lacking in rules for wilderness travel (I may just not have seen them, since we were just running individual modules). But is it more than what's lacking though, is it also the stuff that's added like the emphasis on otherworldly patrons and such?<br/><br/>Here I go again with completely off topic questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482365/#Comment_482365" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-23T00:15:24+00:00" title="April 23, 2019 12:15AM">April 23</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" rel="nofollow">Trent_W</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>A few well-placed area attacks would make short work out of our CR1/4 and L1 hordes.

I actually ran across almost exactly this situation in the 5E campaign I played: five PCs (levels 5-7) against 20 or so low-level monsters (zombies or skeletons).<br/><br/>Because it was a random encounter and we started at a fair distance from each other, the \u201cbad guys\u201d were all dead before their initiative even came up! All slaughtered.<br/><br/>A similar encounter happened later with a band of goblins. (Maybe 15-20 of them.) They got in a lot more attacks, and the \u201csoft targets\u201d had to carefully keep their distance, but otherwise it was a very easy fight, with little real danger.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> - I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts on DCC and adventure structure, as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482366/#Comment_482366" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-23T00:31:56+00:00" title="April 23, 2019 12:31AM">April 23</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2019 12:32AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited April 23</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have only read some minor DCC adventures, actually - most of what I know of the game is from reading the core rulebook and some supplementary material (e.g. the considerately put-together Lankhmar book they recently put out). If you tell me that the adventures are sort of middle schoolish, I believe that; the books I've read are very old school in <i>aesthetics</i>, but it's not particularly challenge-oriented, GM-hygienic or wargamey.<br/><br/>It's actually an excellent example of what I mean when I say that "old school" is not a creative agenda, but rather an aesthetic; DCC is totally old school, but it's not really written for the specific kind of futile and twisted D&amp;D that I like to play myself. Very similar to <i>Mazes and Minotaurs</i> in that I like the aesthetics in both, and they're close enough for government work, but I always get the distinct feeling while reading that these people are softcore; they don't <i>really</i> embrace hygienic practice, playing for failure and player responsibility for their own success in the way e.g. LotFP does, to pick an example of the other flavour of old school.<br/><br/>(I will emphasize here: there is nothing wrong with being softcore in this sense. The only thing that might be remotely wrong is when you're not honest about what you're doing, which is admittedly a problem at times when people pretend to being more hardcore than they actually are. The world is full of human imperfection though, and that's no more special than any other sort. It's not like I'm any more sane myself, my imperfection just takes different forms.)<br/><br/>That being said, it is also the case that there is nothing whatsoever in the DCC rules that I remember as a particularly serious hurdle for using it as the mechanical basis for the hardcore challenge-oriented adventuring D&amp;D that I so adore. It's basically similar to other new old school rules texts: a bunch of mechanizations for common D&amp;D situations, with relatively little systemic text or technical framing for what the GM should do with it. I wouldn't mind running it myself any more than I would mind other good old school rules sets. It's perhaps a bit mechanically intensive, and thus not the nimblest of tools, but there are far worse out there.

This is absolutely awesome and why I chose DCC for our OSR sandbox campaign, a first for us: It makes the campaign railroad-proof because magic is so unpredictably powerful.<br/><br/>The problem is that spellburn allows PCs to 'buy' these results at will. Burn ten points of Strength, Dexterity and Personality each, and you're basically there. Abysmal ability scores (except for Intelligence and Luck) are not much of a problem for a spellcaster (your melee prowess sucked to begin with, and a low AC/Reflex save etc. are ugly, but you are in the second rank anyway).<br/><br/>It takes thirty days to recover from this <b>but if the players set the pace of the campaign (as they do in a sandbox campaign), this drawback is a non-issure</b>. Nuke the dungeon (unroof it with <i>enlarge</i>, put everyone to <i>sleep</i>, <i>summon animal</i>s like a bunch of grizzlies to clear out the monsters - this is how my group cleared the first two levels of Dyson's Delve in an evening - or whatever), go home with the treasure, wait for the magic-user to recover.<br/><br/>In my opinion, only heavy-handed DMing can make magic-users pay the price by forcing the PCs into adventures against their will, either after a big spellburn or by using the convention-style set-ups of many DCC modules ("you have until sunrise before the mysterious tower disappears again").<br/><br/>(I admit that I have not tried using DCC-as-written, but I have analysed and houseruled the heck out of it and am convinced it's not what I would want for a sandbox.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482368/#Comment_482368" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-23T00:36:28+00:00" title="April 23, 2019 12:36AM">April 23</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the DCC report, Johann - that's top self content, highly interesting.

I will in fact just start restarting the game to avoid the "black mark" if it's not avoidable otherwise.<br/><br/>I actively grow distressed by a video game when I realize that I have ended up in a feed drip without any purpose outside retaining my attention as long as possible. I'm not an animal, I don't want to be managed by a computer software.<br/><br/>It's probably no surprise that this transfers to tabletop games, too.

I would play such a game, even knowing that I was being robbed of actually developing skill, overcoming challenge, and all the other good things.<br/><br/>When the purpose of a game is to entertain a single player for a long period of time, that sounds like a great idea. However, I don't really see a good way of doing that in a group endeavour, like a D&amp;D game. Unless the game's goals are always perfectly aligned and synchronized for every character/player (so that group success and individual success are always one and the same), it doesn't sound like something that's feasible by humans in real time (and would have strange consequences if it did).<br/><br/>We do see such mechanics in some RPGs, though, like Lady Blackbird's "pool dice" (which you lose when you succeed, but not when you fail), and any game which rewards your character for failing (e.g. Dungeon World's "mark experience on a miss").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ebear" title="ebear"><img alt="ebear" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ebear">ebear</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482459/#Comment_482459" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-24T02:20:45+00:00" title="April 24, 2019  2:20AM">April 24</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> <a href="/forums/profile/Johann">@Johann</a> I really appreciate you sharing your impressions/experiences with DCC and how it applies to the style of game we have been talking about.<br/><br/>I think it's kind of interesting how D&amp;D as a system can change within a group of players.

Just out of curiosity how long did you play with it before you reached those conclusions, like approximately in terms of sessions?<br/><br/>I have this pet theory (it's probably not new), that simpler systems become more appealing over time. When you first start playing more is better, you want a lot of props like sweet crit tables and spells that summon way too many grizzlies or whatever.<br/><br/>Imagine these games are like a hot fudge sundae cherries and chocolate sauce all over it. By the time you are eating your 50th sundae you realize you can't taste the ice cream underneath at all so you switch to plain vanilla, and find out there are all these subtle tastes to it depending on where the vanilla was grown or the exact salt content of the ice cream. You eat that for a while and the hot fudge sundae looks like some awful ploy to sell you bad ice cream (and it might be).<br/><br/>Ok this metaphor is maybe not that useful, but I think what I'm trying to say is there is a context to play that haven't seen talked about (though I'm sure it has been), which is "how much are you doing it." It's funny I've never played B/X as is pretty clear from this thread. But I've always thought it would be cool to do the opposite, something like X/B. A system that has a bunch of fun toys at the beginning and then becomes more system/challenge focused at the end.<br/><br/>I think about this a lot because I've played more D&amp;D than anyone else that I know in my personal life, and I still feel like I'm just getting the hang of it. I introduce new people to the game <i>a lot</i>, and I think DCC modules are great for this because they're relatively consistent in terms of the experiences they produce (<i>consistent can also be read "boring"</i>), which is great if you're not sure if this might be the only game of D&amp;D the person ever plays.<br/><br/>Anyway I'm pretty sure this isn't a new idea to anyone here but I thought I'd bring it up anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ebear" title="ebear"><img alt="ebear" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ebear">ebear</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482461/#Comment_482461" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-24T02:44:58+00:00" title="April 24, 2019  2:44AM">April 24</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>It's not about the game holding your hand or IV dripping you.

But I'm just bad at a lot of games, even when I practice a lot I get better but I still feel like I'm way to far behind.<br/><br/>There's a game I like called <i>Hollow Knight</i> that is a platformer with really beautiful art and music. There was something cool about struggling to make it to the next area and the reward of seeing the new sprites when I got there. But at the same time I never made it to the end of the game because of time and my skill level so there's a bunch of stuff I'll never get to see which is kind of sad.<br/><br/>I think when people make these kind of interactive art experiences they imagine everyone else will experience them basically the same way they do. I'm putting words in other peoples mouths but I think in their eyes alternate modes would be a pollution of the experience as they intended it. But maybe without realizing that people won't actually have that experience if they _don't_ allow people to make adjustments.<br/><br/>I actually realize I'm talking about something different now, not a game that adapts to you, but one you can adjust yourself like a helmet strap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22030/d-d-replacement-characters-level" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22030/d-d-replacement-characters-level" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22030/d-d-replacement-characters-level/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F22030%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F22030%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
