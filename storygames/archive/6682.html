"Oh, so it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nextwave" rel="nofollow">Nextwave</a>."<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://plays-well.com/nextwave.jpg"/><br/>NOTE: They're the ones in the trench coats.<br/><br/>So... now I might have to make this happen.<br/><br/>Clearly there needs to be some hippie storygamer way for characters to have flashbacks in order to get temporary bonuses to rolls.  Like, the team is fighting MODOK (Mental Organism Designed Only for Killing) and some character makes an offhand comment like, "This beast is nothing compared to my first boyfriend."  And the entire group yells "FLASHBACK!" and we get 15 seconds of the boyfriend before cutting back to the action and giving the character a bonus against this lesser evil.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://plays-well.com/nextwave2.jpg"/><br/><br/>Other than that, I'd say 4e is surprisingly (or, perhaps, unsurprisingly) perfect.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147991/#Comment_147991" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T07:40:32+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  7:40AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I'd play that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Svante%20Landgraf" title="Svante Landgraf"><img alt="Svante Landgraf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Svante%20Landgraf">Svante Landgraf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147993/#Comment_147993" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T07:44:12+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  7:44AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is so awesome.

They might be able to refine existing powers into new types of attacks, though, or gain new equipment or something.<br><br>The part I'm more worried about hacking for 4e is how the characters never really get hurt.  The point of their enemies doesn't seem to be threatening them physically.  They're more like an impediment to their goals, which D&amp;D models less well, though I guess the whole point of an encounter is that you have to get through it to get to the next story tidbit or next encounter.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148000/#Comment_148000" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T08:03:13+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  8:03AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2008 8:04AM by J_Walton.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, I bet you could design it so that the characters have to stunt well in order to get past significant encounters.

I've thought about planning a new Nextwave team called "Secondwave"  or something like that... the idea being that players can take any second-tier (or lower) hero or even villain turned good from the Marvel Universe and remake them in an updated Nextwave style for the parody humor thing.<br/>So... I'm in!!<br/><br/><br/>I don't know about D&amp;D4...  I'd totally be willing to try it.

Leveling up your other powers or gaining new powers is not nearly as important.<br/><br/>I also think it'd be dead simple to drop in some TSOY style keys that give you Action Points.

Go through the five phases of character gen from <b>Spirit of the Century</b> (SOTC), writing a paragraph each for childhood, origin, first graphic novel, then team-ups in two other player's graphic novels.<br/>\n3. Players then assign one Aspect for each phase. These would take the place of Complications in MnM, and work just like Aspects in SOTC, being a source and sink for Hero Points. I'd give out 5 Hero Points that refresh up to 5 each session.<br/>\n4.

BOOM!!<br/><br/>RRRAAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!! Action! Excitement! Explosions! What do you get when you combine four D-list superheroes, a thinly-veiled Nick Fury clone, a hero whose code name contains an expletive, Warren Ellis, Stuart Immonen, bad guys made out of genetically altered kelp, and a giant lizard monster in purple underpants? You get Nextwave, a wild and wacky fun ride which just happens to be one of the best new comics of 2006.<br/><br/>Nextwave tells the tale of a bunch of Third-rate characters from the outskirts of superherodom assemble into a team dedicated to, as one of the taglines puts it, \u201chealing America by beating people up.\u201d They formerly worked for a secret, anti-terrorist organization named H.A.T.E. which in turn was funded and armed by the Beyond Corporation which in turn is the new name for S.I.L.E.N.T, a terrorist group which H.A.T.E. was created to fight. When the heroes find out that the company they work for is being used by the same terrorists they are supposed to stop, they go A.W.O.L.<br/>The Highest Anti-Terrorism Effort, or H.A.T.E. (a subsidiary of the Beyond Corporation\xa9) put NEXTWAVE together to fight Bizarre Weapons of Mass Destruction. When it's learned that H.A.T.E. and Beyond\xa9 are terrorist cells themselves and that the BWMDs were intended to kill the heroes, they are less than pleased. In fact, they are rather angry. So they make things explode. Lots of things.<br/><br/>Nextwave is an inventive comic, rich with humor and excitement, there is a ton of innuendo and sarcasm. It is an action, adventure no-holds-bar satire of all the tropes of 4-colored supers. This team is so thoroughly modern that they spend all their time insulting each other. When it comes time to save the day, everyone splits up and does whatever they do with little or no concern for the others. It\u2019s the ultimate group of individuals, and it\u2019s very of the moment, now that news is out that our society is more isolated than ever. Everybody lies, and everyone\u2019s a smart aleck. No Care Bear Stares saving the day here; put in a room and told to act on their core emotions, this bunch would end up eating each other. They still manage to do their jobs, though, stopping the bad and worse guys. It shows that some times when they let creators run loose, great things happen. It\u2019s billed as a humorous comic centered around five less than popular Marvel super heroes. More importantly, the humour is English, which I love. It\u2019s better than drugs in its ludicrous imagery. It\u2019s all \u2014 whether War Gardens, broccoli-men grown as interchangeable fighters, pterodactyl suits, or samurai robots \u2014 just an excuse to have fights in ever more outrageous ways. The visuals more than keep up with the ideas, especially when it comes to the killer koalas, all noses and fangs. Cuddly yet dangerous.<br/><br/>Nextwave is a very old school thrill ride that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense and certainly doesn\u2019t stand up to serious scholarly analysis. The plot is mostly an excuse for explosions. How Ellis and Immonen manage to deliver this reading experience using (post)modern trappings I have no idea. But it\u2019s certainly one of Marvel\u2019s best five at the moment.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148612/#Comment_148612" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T12:15:36+00:00" title="June  6, 2008 12:15PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Nextwave Roster:  The team is composed of Monica Rambeau the former Avenger once known as Captain Marvel and Photon she\u2019s in charge of a group of misfits who resent her authority while secretly craving it, Aaron Stack a robot who \u201cdoes robot-y things\u201d formerly known as Machine Man, Tabitha Smith is PMS made flesh - a California party girl formerly a member of X-Force known as \u201cBoom Boom" and "Meltdown\u201d because she blows things up, adventurer Elsa Bloodstone who\u2019s the super strong gorgeous fighting machine and daughter of famous monster hunter Ulysses Bloodstone she's a violence-loving English Buffy type and she's English, and a new character called Captain **** the asterisks (which are a skull and crossbones in the book) standing in for some undefined curse word he's an anti-social loser with the usual invulnerability and super-strength whose origin is a brutal parody of Green Lantern\u2019s. A seriously motley crew facing off against...  Dirk Anger, Bad Guy, is what happens when the authority figure actually wants the power given: a twisted mass of neuroses proving every rumor about every perversion possessed by every leader through history true. The team doesn\u2019t have missions so much as last-ditch protective actions, whether they\u2019re saving a town from Fin Fang Foom (the dragon in purple underwear) or trying to stop a police officer who\u2019s been taken over by a sort of virus that\u2019s turning him into a Transformer. All six main cast members appear on the cover of Avengers: The Initiative, suggesting they are one of the 50-State Initiative teams.<br/> <br/>The first of which is Fin Fang Foom, a huge ancient Chinese dragon in purple underpants.<br/><br/>You might not have heard from some of these characters in a while. Heck, you might not have heard of some of these characters at all. These aren't the type of heroes that Marvel is building big summer crossovers around or that Hollywood is rushing make movies about. You get the feeling Marvel just gave Ellis a list of characters and said, "Here. Do what you want with them. We don't care." Which might be why the team's former boss is Dirk Anger from H.A.T.E. and not Nick Fury from S.H.I.E.L.D.. The similarity between the two characters goes deeper than just the name. Nick Fury is still a vital character and therefore might have been off limits for Ellis to use.<br/>Ellis was given carte blanche to do whatever he wants with the title and the characters, then this might be one of the smartest things that Marvel has ever done. Ellis revels in the free license Marvel has given him, and this results in some of his best writing in years. He uses his free rein to make Nextwave a high-brow parody book, one where he can play with and poke fun at comic book conventions.<br/>The book is laugh-out loud funny at times, and the dialog is eminently quotable. If this was a movie, or if more people read comics, some of what Ellis comes off with would become part of our everyday lexicon. Dirk Anger's address to his new recruits is especially droll. The writing is top notch all around, silly without being stupid, amusing without being addlebrained.<br/>As if the first issue wasn't funny enough, we are treated to a letters page where such historic figures as Genghis Khan and Napoleon offer their opinions on the issue we just read. Hey, William Shakespeare likes the book! What else do you need to know to take a chance on the book?<br/><br/><br/>And as a special bonus, the letters page prints the lyrics to the Nextwave theme song. Yes, you read that correctly.<br/>Nextwave has an official Nextwave Theme Song<br/><br/><br/>It's like Shakespeare But with lots more punching It's like Goethe But with lots more crushing Like Titanic But the boat's still floating No it's not!
