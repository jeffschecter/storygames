I mean, I wouldn't say that stakes setting is "gone again". Many of the most foundational pure-form stakes-utilizing games were published just what, seven years back. That's just about enough time for me to consider them fully matured. The issue is further confused by the insistence of the Internet to take every idle musing so very seriously. A few years back everybody was all about those stakes-setting discussions Jonathan mentions, but as far as I understood at the time, it was just a bunch of discussion about people misunderstanding stakes setting, not any profound sea change. Functional play remains functional play, no matter the Internet trends.<br/><br/>I wouldn't deny that trends change, but at the sort of level of detail you're looking at there's probably no more profound answer than "Vincent Baker's been investigating alternatives recently". That's your perceived trend: one prominent designer has been doing things in somewhat different ways lately. Besides, I wouldn't even call e.g. Apocalypse World a non-stakes game, it doesn't have any fundamental differences from say TSoY, or going further back, Sorcerer. (This isn't too surprising - most of the stakes-setting discourse in the Internet is extremely superficial, mostly concerning things like who says what instead of the fundamental issues of currency and narration control.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373428/#Comment_373428" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T10:26:13+00:00" title="April 18, 2012 10:26AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, looking at relatively recent games, most feature explicit stakes.

Stakes setting was a revolutonary idea that got explored in a variety of ways. Is it still? Probably. I think it depends on the game.<br><br>It was popular because it was new and lots of designers wanted to try out this new tool and play with it in new ways. I'm sure part of this reason was inclusion in Dogs and PTA, both big early indie games and influencers - those two were my gateway drugs. Then it lost its shine and it became clear that this wasn't a system meant for every game.<br/><br/>I haven't played any of the games Eero listed, and the two I have played (AW and Fiasco) I disagree have stake setting. Fiasco you pick to establish or resolve a scene. The resolve isn't set up as a stake. The scene plays out, and you (or the rest of the table) decides if the resolution is mostly positive or mostly negative for your character.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think we're seeing less stake setting because it's not a good fit for every game. It probably isn't a good fit for most games. I also know a lot of players who have a problem with it and it sometimes proved to be a barrier for me to convert story-focused but traditional familiar players to indie games. It's a very meta concept. Setting stakes requires players to pull back from the fiction a little bit or a lot. A lot of people don't like to play that way.<br/><br/>Lately I've been seeing games trend towards stake setting as more of an undercurrent of resolution systems. Whether it's Fiasco's "let the scene play out to find the stakes" or Smallville's "let each action be their own stakes within the fiction" or some other style.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373454/#Comment_373454" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T11:44:32+00:00" title="April 18, 2012 11:44AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan: Apocalypse World has stakes-setting, it's just incorporated into the game crunch. It's exactly like TSoY in this regard: in both games you can certainly have stakes like "I turn my rival into a frog with my magic", but only if you have the crunch that permits you to request these stakes. In AW it's called "moves", in TSoY it's called "Secrets", but the basic principle is the same. In both cases the most important feature is there: we know in advance what we're rolling for, and how to interpret the roll directly against that goal.<br/><br/>Of course it's a bit different from raw universal conflict resolution with free stakes-setting, but if we're talking about strictly the latter, then that's just a specific extreme variation of the form. And if we're talking about stakes-setting in general, then I think that the fundamental question vs. older generic skill systems is whether stakes are present at all, not whether there are mechanical constraints or guidelines upon the kinds of stakes you can use. In this regard I consider any game where the rules establish binding pre-roll stakes to be "stakes-setting". The player doesn't have to be able to choose any possible stakes freely for it to be stakes-setting; in fact, I can't name a well-written game that would claim such, they all use different tools in predetermining the stakes.<br/><br/>As I intimated above, I mostly think that people have just accepted the last round of stakes-setting hulabaloo and moved on. Apparently nobody here is feeling like talking about the actual topic of the last round, which as I understood it was about contrasting conflict resolution with task resolution. Perhaps the new topic could be about whether mechanically constrained stakes (Apocalypse World) are better than freeform stakes (HeroQuest, say) or organic non-stakes conflict resolution systems (Sorcerer, IaWA, D&amp;D) <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Aaand here we are again depicting how these Internet discussions about stakes-setting are slow and weighty affairs. We could probably do one page of defining our terms before we even started talking about whether "stakes" or history or not. And another page about whether opening the safe is a stake or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373456/#Comment_373456" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T11:51:15+00:00" title="April 18, 2012 11:51AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jamie, I won't swear to it now, but I remember <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1199&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> as being pretty significant for understanding the history of the opinion of the scene at large about this particular technique.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373458/#Comment_373458" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T12:02:55+00:00" title="April 18, 2012 12:02PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2012 12:03PM by J_Walton.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I consider any game where the rules establish binding pre-roll stakes to be "stakes-setting".</blockquote>\nThat's cool: you're welcome to define terms however you want, I was just pointing out -- <i>that's not what Jamie is asking about</i>, in terms of stakes-setting emerging as a design trend and then disappearing or being incorperated in different ways.

For Luke, at least, he explains pretty straightforwardly that the stake definition part of a roll in his game is to fight a toxic gameplay culture of rolls that are unproductive, deceptive, or repetitive -- in other words, to keep illusionism out of the picture. Part of the assumption was that people might come to Burning Wheel from a toxic D&amp;D game in which the GM is expected to "tell the story," and manipulate all roll results to that end; by formalizing the communication process, you can make this harder to do, and (more importantly) signal to the players that you weren't supposed to do that. Let it Ride and "Say yes or roll dice" are part of the same structure here; they make it clear that when the players roll dice, it should be meaningful, and they should be (diagetically) well-informed about the situation -- otherwise they aren't really participating in the game. You can also look at this as the clarification of IIEE as an important part of resolution mechanic design. So in this light, stake setting is a tool to put the focus back on the things the players are aiming to change or accomplish in play.<br/><br/><b>Why not stake setting:</b><br/>So in the lead-up to Apocalypse World, Vincent talks a lot about the "moment of judgement": a point during gameplay where you have to refer to the fiction to apply the rules. There were a few game designs in the intervening period between Dogs and AW that were essentially finite state story machines: the rules interacted with each other and with the numbers on your sheet, and you made mechanical decisions, and then you were supposed to narrate stuff that was in line with the mechanical results. But, since the mechanics didn't refer to the fiction, it had a tendency to become thin and unsatisfying, because the game still "works" without proper narration. If you look at D&amp;D 4th edition, for example, you see people complaining about there being no roleplaying in the game, and other people saying "well just narrate stuff during combat!" You can do this, of course, and the game even suggests you ought to, but since there's no mechanical reason to, it often falls by the wayside in favor of "I hit him again." (Note that I like D&amp;D 4th a lot, but it's an example of this problem.)<br/><br/>My impression, which is not scientific, is that it can be difficult to align stake setting (in which the consequences of a roll are generally decided before the roll itself, and you are often encouraged to ask for what you want rather than what you believe might reasonably arise from the existing fiction) with judgement (which relies on looking at both the result of a roll, the character's decisions and the existing narrative to move the narrative forward). As Eero basically says, Vincent wrote AW, and he happened not to use stakes (although there ARE stakes when you write a front, just not directly in conflict resolution). Maybe this gave people the impression that stakes and judgement are incompatible. I suspect they aren't, but, on the other hand, stake setting is a means to an end -- if you have another way to make sure the game focuses on the player's choices, or you're not worried about a "brain damage" culture any more, what's the benefit you're looking for from having stake setting in the first place?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber" title="epweissengruber"><img alt="epweissengruber" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber">epweissengruber</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373460/#Comment_373460" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T12:23:33+00:00" title="April 18, 2012 12:23PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Burning games have stakes setting.<br/>\nHeroquest's "prizes" are stakes setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373461/#Comment_373461" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T12:26:18+00:00" title="April 18, 2012 12:26PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To add to what Liam's saying, one of the other concerns about stake-setting is "play-before-you-play" issues. Games with really effective stakes-setting don't detail possible outcomes any more than they have to, they simply say the thing that's at stake ("Your mother's trust"), not how it will be dealt with after resolution.  Otherwise, it can feel like you don't actually get to play out the meatiest part of the game, where the consequences actually get determined. This is related to Liam's point about feeling a disconnectedness with the fiction. Reactions to the potential for disconnect and pre-play have varied. "Fiction first" is definitely one. Emphasizing task resolution over conflict resolution is another (and the recent indie interest in OSR is partially related to that, I think). On the more experimental and freeform side of things, there are games that reject mechanical resolution entirely (like Silver &amp; White), replacing it with some other interesting mechanic that structures play without really resolving tasks or conflicts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373462/#Comment_373462" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T12:35:55+00:00" title="April 18, 2012 12:35PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Considering free (that is, players can choose what they are rolling for pretty freely) and explicit (players know in advance what the dice will establish for the fiction) stakes-setting, it's pretty much a feature of universal resolution systems. So you'd want to have it in any system that tries to get by with just one resolution procedure for any situation. In fact, making an universal resolution mechanic meaningful requires explicit stakes-setting; as we know, traditional games get by without explicit stakes-setting in large part because the resolution procedure involves very concrete fictional events and actions that at least give the players an illusion of concrete stakes if nothing else. On the other hand, if your resolution system is just "when you need to resolve, take one die per character sheet trait that's been introduced into the scene and then roll them all hoping for big numbers" (a common universal resolution mechanic), then the procedure itself in no way implies stakes. This is why an explicit discussion of "why are we rolling, again?" is often a necessity in this sort of game.<br/><br/>The amount of pre-roll negotiation and the ambiguity of stakes-setting may be drawn back by adding focus and mechanical elements that reduce the ambiguity. A resolution system may also be made to resolve first and establish meaning later. Both of these are different from explicit stakes-setting discussion in that nobody needs to ask why we're rolling the dice right now. It seems to me that particularly that first thing is pretty common because extra detail and focus in a game is simply fun. You can publish something like <i>HeroQuest</i> (a grand-daddy of free and explicit stakes-setting) once, but doing that again and again isn't useful in any way. In this way it's not a surprise that vanilla stakes-setting is somewhat less common as the time goes by.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>That's cool: you're welcome to define terms however you want, I was just pointing out --<i>that's not what Jamie is asking about</i>, in terms of stakes-setting emerging as a design trend and then disappearing or being incorperated in different ways. He's asking about something much more specific.</blockquote>\nYes. I was answering Jamie's question, though. Admittedly my answer is to get sceptical about the timeline he lays out, and about the very claim that stakes-setting is somehow "gone". To me it seems that we've just seen more games with a firmer and less freeform stakes-setting procedure lately, not that stakes-setting would have disappeared. There is a distinction here, even with full understanding of what Jamie was asking about. In fact, you name the distinction: stakes-setting has been largely <i>incorporated</i>, not abandoned. It's talked about less because it's become easier (thanks to more specificity in the mechanics) and less controversial at the same time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373464/#Comment_373464" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T12:40:15+00:00" title="April 18, 2012 12:40PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I do not consider Burning Wheel to involve stake setting, but that may be a semantic argument. In Burning Wheel you state your intent and describe how your character goes about fulfilling that intent in the fiction of the game (this constitutes the task). The GM then considers that intent and task, tells you what skill is appropriate to fulfilling it, what the obstacle is (the number of successes required) and the consequence of failure.<br/><br/>The intent put forward by the player and the consequence put forward by the GM look a lot like stakes. But it is limited. In Burning Wheel, your intent must be closely correlated with the task. In other words, the character, your fictional avatar in the game world, must be capable of taking an action that brings about the result you're seeking (your intent). You can't, for instance, say: "My intent is to make the castle tumble into ruin. My task is stabbing the king during the ceremony." Unless, of course, it has already been established that there is some sort of connection between the state of repair of the castle and the life of the king. Otherwise, the GM would be more than justified in saying: "Nice try. Taking out that castle is going to require an Artillerist test. Hope you brought your siege engineers!"<br/><br/>On the GM side, the consequence must also follow from the intent and task. If you're trying to seduce a barmaid with a poetry test, the GM can't say: "If you fail this test, your mother catches the plague and dies!" That's just not within the scope of the test.<br/><br/>To me, and again this may just be my semantic hangup, stake setting implies a disconnection between the action taken in the fiction and the consequences of that action. Taken to an extreme, this means a player can use any of a character's abilities to achieve any result. There is little mechanical incentive not to use a character's best ability to accomplish everything the player wants to accomplish all the time.<br/><br/>It also tends to involve some level of negotiation between the players: "No, I don't accept that. How about if the consequence is this instead..." At best, IMO, this leads to really watered down fictional events after players negotiate away any outcome seen as too detrimental to their characters. At worst, you spend significant portions of game time negotiating about potential outcomes rather than playing to find out what the outcomes are.<br/><br/>In the end, setting stakes or intent and task or any mechanisms in that vein are techniques. Games should incorporate the techniques that make the experience of playing them better and exclude techniques (even popular techniques that work well in other games) that don't serve that purpose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373467/#Comment_373467" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T12:54:05+00:00" title="April 18, 2012 12:54PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2012 12:54PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thor, pretty much no conflict resolution game works by setting up stakes unrelated to character intent and activity. In fact, it would be wise to use some other term for the rare exceptions like <i>Polaris</i>, where conflicts (whether characters get what they want) are actually resolved by a higher-order narration-trading game between the <i>players</i>. I guess they might be termed "narrative resolution", although Polaris is a bit of a poetic halfway thing in that it involves strongly defined player roles (the Heart, Mistaken, etc.) that obligate the players to endorse certain sorts of stories. If you're willing to interpret the Heart as a mythic character separate from the protagonist of the story, then it's totally conflict resolution <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Burning Wheel, Shadow of Yesterday, Dust Devils, Mountain Witch... pretty much any classical conflict resolution game has the same set-up where players declare character intent and the GM shapes this intent into the stakes before the roll. Here's how I wrote the central procedure in my TSoY rewrite:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Solar System</cite>Conflict stakes The Story Guide has the specific responsibility of declaring the <var>stakes</var> of the conflict after hearing the goals of the characters. This is a slightly intricate issue, so pay attention. Normally, when a conflict is initiated, it is pretty obvious what the conflict is <var>for</var>: a character wishes to bed another, say, and the conflict is over whether he manages to convince the other character to play along. The goals of the characters are rather unambiguous in this sense: whatever the characters want to do, that\u2019s usually what the conflict is about. In these cases the Story Guide just nods and gives the go-ahead for players to proceed with resolving the conflict. The most typical situation where the Story Guide needs to clarify the stakes is when a player\u2019s declared goal is <var>too shallow</var>. For example, a player might describe that his character is going to shoot another character. All well and good, but that is not actually a <i>goal</i>, it\u2019s just what the character is <i>doing </i>to achieve his goal. Is the character trying to stop the other from hurting him? Is he trying to subdue the other by wounding him? Is he trying to kill the other character? For conflict resolution the Story Guide needs to find out and bring these intentions on the table, as the players will need to know what they are resolving when narrating the conflict sequence. Another situation where the Story Guide needs to modify the stakes from the intents described by the players is when a character wants <var>too much</var>. For example, a character might want to rob the emir of a valuable jewel kept on the bosom of emir\u2019s daughter. Can the player just declare a conflict over this and resolve the exciting situation in one roll? This is a matter of <var>leverage</var>, <var>propriety</var> and <var>scope</var>. Leverage, propriety and scope When a character can try to succeed in something, he has <var>leverage</var>. A character who has wings might try to fly because of those wings, for example. A character who has sneaked into the bedchambers of emir\u2019s daughter might try to steal a valuable jewel. Leverage is being in the fictional situation that allows a character to attempt a given goal in the first place. When a character\u2019s declared goal is kinda sudden and unexpected in the context, it is a matter of <var>propriety</var>. This is not so much about moral judgement most of the time, but rather about the norms of the fun game \u2014 a very typical campaign norm is that named, important characters are not killed just like that, off-hand. So in this kind of campaign the Story Guide might question the propriety of the goal and perhaps clarify that while the character might seem to die, he might also come back later as the result of a miraculous rescue, a common motif of adventure stories. When the group thinks that some matter of fiction should not be skimmed too quickly, it is a question of <var>scope</var>. If the emir and his jewel are not important, the group might think that it is a swell idea to have the daring thievery resolved in one conflict \u2014 just roll <var>Thievery (I)</var> against the emir\u2019s <var>Suspicion (R)</var> and be done with it. If that pace is too quick, however, the group might wish to insist on a smaller conflict scope \u2014 finding out whether the character can even get into emir\u2019s seraglio, or how he outwits the guards, or how he charms the emir\u2019s daughter \u2014 these are all fine and exciting conflicts on their own, well able to branch in unexpected directions. When determining the stakes of a conflict, the Story Guide should keep an eye on all of leverage, propriety and scope: is the character in position to try for this goal, or should he first maneuver into position? Is the goal an appropriate event for the genre? Do we, as a group, want to skim or slow down over these events? Making these decisions is not as difficult as it might sound, and the rest of the group will certainly have their own notions. If in doubt, go with the goal declared by the player \u2014 if the emir\u2019s jewel is just a step in some interesting story, take care of it in one conflict and move on. </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373471/#Comment_373471" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T13:12:54+00:00" title="April 18, 2012  1:12PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, you've got stake-setting in Dogs and PTA.

In Trollbabe, the GM designs a scenario by asking a question of "what is at stake here?" I.e., what's at stake is whether or not the villagers kill the troll who lives outside their village. Or what's at stake is whether or not the kingdom is overrun by the troll army. However, the GM is supposed to keep this question secret from the players: it's just there to guide play.

It isn't completely free, though, which is one of the things that distinguishes it from story-boarding. The player can only put up one effect pre-roll (additional effects can be produced post-roll, but the player chooses between them rather than declaring them), and there are certain areas where the scope of effect is limited (for instance, you can't have "I kill Joe" as your stake, merely "I shoot Joe"). All of those things -- post-roll, often unforeseen additional consequences (i.e. Fortune in the Middle), limitations on scope and number of effects -- are things you don't see in story-boarding games (which, to be fair, were almost entirely games written for contests).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373488/#Comment_373488" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T14:04:43+00:00" title="April 18, 2012  2:04PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite><cite>Posted By: Marshall Burns</cite>So, you've got stake-setting in Dogs and PTA.

They're talking about one thing, but there's all this subtext, and then someone busts out an awesome line and the other person is all dumbfounded and flustered. And then we're like "oh no! We're having a conflict" And then we have to figure out what the stakes are, and who is involved, and pick out all our dice, and by the time we've done that, especially if it's not really clear what the stakes are, a lot of the momentum has been lost, and that delicious subtext is all out in the open.<br/><br/>Implicit stakes-setting, as in Apocalypse World, avoids that problem. We don't need anything but the fiction we've already produced before we roll, and the roll directs us straight back to the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373503/#Comment_373503" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T14:57:08+00:00" title="April 18, 2012  2:57PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Im on my cell ATM, so I cant easily post a link, but Chris Chinn wrotd an excellemt article on hisblog called "chopping the world in two" or something similar that addresses this issue very well imho.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373522/#Comment_373522" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T16:36:33+00:00" title="April 18, 2012  4:36PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That same thing happens in BW too, Simon.

That is an example of system-regulated stakes. The entire D&amp;D combat system is basically similar to e.g. Heroquest's complex conflict system. The stakes thing is not significant for it because it's already effective in processing the sorts of stakes it's used for.<br/><br/>Where conflict resolution (and by extension stakes-setting) becomes important is in the context of general skill systems that do not have conflict-regulation mechanisms like hit points backing them. For example, D&amp;D ability checks and the skill checks in the ordinary traditional games; these don't have firm conflict resolution procedures attached, which means that it's basically up to the playgroup to utilize these systems in ways that actually resolve things. Stakes-setting is one way of quickly turning an arbitrary system such as task resolution into a conflict resolution system: identify conflict, agree within the group that it's gonna be resolved via this task resolution (or whatever) and then resolve. Games like Burning Wheel and TSoY do this, and you can use the same method with a traditional game, too.<br/><br/>All that's not going to be meaningful for you if e.g. you've always had conflict resolution procedures in your personal play habits, in which case you've been able to utilize the specific task resolution systems of individual games in productive ways. I believe that some gamers have grown up like this, they've learned early on to use the task resolution systems effectively. Other gamers, on the other hand, have had their problems, usually involving illusionism or obfuscation or simple inability to communicate intent among the group. For these gamers an explicit conflict resolution system (with free and explicit stakes-setting or not) is a boon, as it effectively enforces a procedure of play where players focus on identifying conflicts, and the system is used effectively in resolving them.

Here's a fake play snippet.\n<blockquote>GM: You need to find the will.<br/>PC: Okay, I open the safe.<br/>GM: Roll Thievery. Success, you open the safe, fail, the guards catch you.<br/>(dice rattle)<br/>PC: Got it.<br/>GM: Okay, you open the safe, but the will's not in there.</blockquote>\nSo, is the line where the GM describes the consequences of success and failure stake setting? It looks like it to me -- everybody knows what's at stake for this roll. On the other hand, the thing the PC actually wants -- the will -- is not actually up for grabs here, but the PC doesn't know that. Is this conflict resolution? Looks like task resolution to me, because the roll resolves the opening of the safe. But obviously the PC is trying to find the will, so it's also a step in a larger process of conflict resolution. You could easily say, instead,\n<blockquote>PC: I raise. (dice slide) I open the safe. I'll roll in "retired thief." (rattle)<br/>GM: (slide) Block. You open the safe, but the will's not in there.</blockquote>\nNow it's definitely conflict resolution -- but in the level of this individual ACTION, it's task resolution? This is why I prefer talking about this stuff in terms of design goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373649/#Comment_373649" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T11:46:15+00:00" title="April 19, 2012 11:46AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, conflict vs. task has been used to describe waaay different things by different people.

All of those are valid intentions.  the intention Im talking about is whatever you are resolving <i>right now</i>.<br/><br/>If the character intends to <b>open the safe</b> and you set that as your scope of resolution -<br/><br/>If the system says, roll your lockpicking skill and you <i>open whatever you are trying to open</i>, then it has resolved that intention. = conflict resolution<br/>If the system says, roll your lockpicking skill and the GM decides whether that resolves opening the safe, then you have used task resolution.  The GM might say "<i>well, you did great on your lockpicking, but unfortunately this also has a digital failsafe that has 3 hours to go before it release the door</i>".  Passed your task, failed your conflict.<br/><br/>Similarly, if there was such a game where you were encouraged to use <b>Progressing around the wheel of reincarnation and eventually reach Nirvana</b> as the scope of a single resolution, you could do that via either task or conflict res depending if the system directly resoves it or it requires GM interpretation of your "gain karma" task roll.<br/><br/>The scope of resolution is irrelevent.<br/><br/>I believe the confusion over scope comes from the fact that games that dont set out to do conflict resolution usually support/encourage small scopes of resolution only (even though they do conflict resolution some of the time at that small scope, such when you want to hit a thing with a sword).  and usually, games that set out to support conflict reoslution generally allow or even encoruage larger scopes of resolution.  <br/><br/>It the my cat has 4 legs, my dog has 4 legs, therefore my dog is a cat logic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373781/#Comment_373781" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-20T02:52:07+00:00" title="April 20, 2012  2:52AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Noooo!

However it is this last system which most strongly influences how the conflicts of the town are resolved, not actually the conflict resolution subsystem. <br/><br/>There may be a third subsystem at this level, if you count player moral judgement - but that seems to emerge in some games more than others.<br/><br/>The traditional complaint about task resolution is that the task and the goal are too loosely coupled through the GM, which under some social circumstances is problematic, see the whole OSR sense of DM impartiality as a social remedy to this problem, rather than the typical indie game mechanical solution. <br/><br/>Ultimately the scopes* of the different subsystems and how they are coupled is a powerful set of design decisions, being aware and using them right or playing with them consciously is far better than blasting or glorifying a particular strategy such as explicit stake setting or task resolution.<br/><br/>   -

Look at you guys go.<br/><br/>Anyhow, I have learned.  Sounds like the reason 'stake setting' in the 'this game explicitly asks the players to set stakes' sort of sense came into being was pretty much why I expected. BUT - a lot of it is focused on 'player succeeds at a roll and doesn't get what they expect' - seems to me a more common problem in older games is 'player fails at a roll and gets punished harder than they expect' ("What? I didn't expect to get knocked out completely!") (AW's "If you miss a roll you won't like it" is a pretty neat way to solve that.)<br/><br/>That gencon conversation where a few people decided they didn't like it surprises me: 'chesting' hasn't ever felt like a problem in sessions I've played. Ron says stakes-setting games end up either 1. getting stakes via consensus or .. actually, I forget what the others are, because we've always gone with consensus and it has been fine.<br/><br/>What Jonathan said about 'pre-play', on the other hand, rings true for me and I thought maybe that's why explicit-stakes-setting was frowned upon - you spend this time discussing what's going to happen, then roll some dice/play some cards, and then some (or even none) of it happens. So it feels like some of it got narrated twice (or maybe you just skip the narration the second time because you know what happened and the extra narration seems like a forced step) and some of it you spent time narrating only to have that effort wasted.<br/><br/>I do have a sort of house-ruley approach to those sorts of games, to make that effort feel 'not wasted' - when introducing the 'possible consequences' I try to narrate the threat into the fiction. If 'blown roll =&gt; your wife leaves you', narrate in her saying, 'Gerald, if you walk out that door I'm not going to be here when you get back!'                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373893/#Comment_373893" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-20T18:59:57+00:00" title="April 20, 2012  6:59PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>If the system requires added human judgement to resolve the character's intentions, then it is  doing task resolution.</blockquote>\nPTA is task resolution by this definition.<br/><br/>Cool, so PTA supports task resolution and encourages a big scope.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373894/#Comment_373894" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-20T19:01:19+00:00" title="April 20, 2012  7:01PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Yeah, that's not a definition I've ever seen and it seems immediately disproveable.</blockquote>\nHey Paul.

Someone points out that they are looking at the exact same block as before, and confusion and a lot of arguing ensues.<br/><br/>The widespread tendency is to look at a game, let's say Dogs in the Vineyard for example, and when you hear that that game has "conflict resolution", you start to spread around your newfound knowledge about the way conflict resolutions needs Mormon gunslingers to works....  (the example is ridiculous and exaggerated, but when you have people confuse conflict resolution with explicit stakes-setting or one-roll resolution, it's not the same thing?)<br/><br/>Ron Edwards use the word "Synecdoche" a lot in his big model essays to describe this process of mistaking the part for the whole (or the other way around).<br/><br/>The meaning of these words, in Forge Theory, is much simpler: you don't need to take out the entire block of rules from a game to get conflict resolution, for example.  Conflict/task is ONLY about "when you roll" (or more generally, when you use your game's equivalent of a roll). Do you roll dice to see if your character is stong/fast/clever enough to pull/climb/notice something? That is task resolution, you are literally "rolling to see if you can do the task".  Or, in your game, you roll ONLY when there is a conflict between characters? That is conflict resolution.<br/><br/>Vincent found a very clever way of describing conflict resolution: "roll the dice or say yes".  People in the Internet were able to misunderstand even something so simple, but if you read the entire chapter that describe that rule, its meaning is clear: don't roll for task (climb a tree), roll only when there is conflict: conflict resolution.<br/><br/>This doesn't requires stakes, and doesn't even require that the roll resolve the conflict of interest between characters (often it doesn't). The combat system in D&amp;D is conflict resolution, because you use it... only when you have a conflict.<br/><br/>The problem of these definitions is that they are TOO simple.  People search for some hidden higher "truth", something mind-blowing that describe an entire game system. But these words are made to be used with each other, simple concept that have to be put together.  <br/><br/>So, ending this rambling:  Stefoid, you are wrong. Really, really wrong. You made a pile of a lot things and called the entire pile Conflict Resolution, even if there are really a lot of examples of games that use conflict resolution that violate every single thing you said.  Even Dogs in the Vineyard and Primetime Adventures would not be conflict resolution by your definition! Both require A LOT of human judgment after the roll to resolve the situation.(and this other little bit is called Fortune in the Middle: if you don't have that human judgment it's fortune at the end)<br/><br/>About stakes, many others have already said what happened, but seeing that a lot have said otherways too, I think I will add this post to the first camp:  the problem with "stakes" was a similar problem to the one I talked about conflict resolution: corruption of the meaning of the word.<br/><br/>"Stakes" was always the wrong word to describe what in Trollbabe was called "goal" (but could be called "intent"). I don't know where, in which game, the meaning of these two words were exchanged and "stakes" began to be used to describe the character's objective, but this caused a lot of the problems: calling it "stakes" a lot of people did misunderstand the meaning, did not understand that it was the characters in-fiction objective, and started story workshopping games that weren't made to be played like this (an this is easily shown in the amount of people who complain online about PTA, and when you ask them about it, it come out that they misunderstood exactly that point of the system)<br/><br/>These days, I see a lot of games with stakes, but (1) they are less explicit about it, and (2) they don't call them stakes anymore. <br/><br/>The problem was (and is) not the use of "explicit stakes": they work really well, and that is reflected by the way they took off in indie game design in 2004-2006. The problems was and is about making people (and in particular this gaming culture) to understand how to use them. At the end dropping the word was simpler.<br/><br/>P.S.: The new edition of Trollbabe has almost 50 pages more than the previous one, and has less rules! The added pages contain detailed and precise instruction to help people understand how to use the rules. At this time is, I believe, the best "teaching test" for the kind of explicit stake-setting conflict resolution used by a lot of other games, including PTA.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373919/#Comment_373919" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-21T02:37:14+00:00" title="April 21, 2012  2:37AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2012 2:56AM by stefoid.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>So, ending this rambling:  Stefoid, you are wrong.

If the official definition of conflict res is you only roll when two characters have conflicting intentions, then sure, thats the definition.  A definition is what it is. <br/><br/>And I think I was sucker-punched with the PTA thing.  On reflection, with PTA a player states their characters intentions and the rule is if they get the most red spots or whatever, their intentions are realised -- the GM interpretation relates to <i>how</i> their intentions are realized, not <i>if</i>.  So by my definition, the system does conflict res.<br/><br/>And I also cant recall their being a specific rule for PTA that says "conflicts are only about conflicting character intentions".  There is one example where a characters aim  is to look good in front of her friends for instance.  Maybe the 'only when characters intentions conflict" is implied.  Not sure.<br/><br/>But I find my unofficial  definition really useful.   In fact, Im going to make it 'official' and call it Challenge Resolution.  Conflict resolution, by your definition, is a subset of challenge resolution as defined by me.<br/><br/>With challenge resolution, <i>you roll when a character acts under pressure</i>, where 'pressure' is defined as - yes - when a characters intentions are in conflict with another's.  But also when the character's intention is being attempted under time, physical or emotional duress.<br/><br/>But the theory is the same - if the system resolves if the characters intentions are realised without human interpretation, then its challenge resolution.  (which is inclusive of  conflict resolution).  If the system requires a human to interpret the roll/pips/whatever, then its task resolution.<br/><br/>My game uses challenge resolution.

This is difficult when you're not asking "what is your definition?" but rather "what is the official definition I can hit people in the head with?". This latter question is foolish, at least until we finally get the RPG police going. They could probably have a, like, special office for terminology definitions. Then we could finally answer the plaintive cries for simple, comprehensive and official terminology. It would surely be a fine day, for afterwards nobody would need to understand anything of substance beyond the terminology people happen to use, they could just confidently use words with dictionary meanings to chatter at each other.<br/><br/>D&amp;D combat system is definitely a conflict resolution system for any meaningful way of using that term that I know. It funnels and regulates all fictional activity into terms that are trivial to apply for answering the question of who wins this fight. I've never heard of anybody playing D&amp;D in a way that would have undermined the conflict-resolution power of the combat system; even the most railroady GMs are forced to cheat on the dice rather than ignoring the outcomes of the combat system. Simultaneously the Climb skill in 3rd edition for the most part is utilized only as task resolution, simply because the system in play proffers no strong guarantees about the significance and meaning of the resolution procedure. (That is, there is no guarantee that the task of climbing a wall coincides with a conflict, and even if it does, there is no guarantee that climbing the wall would contribute to resolving that conflict.) Obviously enough, if you play it like conflict resolution, then it is conflict resolution; doing stakes-setting is one way of ensuring that you're not rolling those Climb checks just to feed the GM's perverse need for dice rituals. Say these magic words before you roll, and the check magically turns into conflict resolution: "This wall is in between me and my goal. If I succeed in this check, I want no more shit about this wall - I'll have cleared it fair and clear!"<br/><br/>Something I usually say about these vapid terminology discourses is that hopeless confusion will persist as long as one insists on viewing "conflict" and "task" as complementary opposites. They're in fact phenomena at entirely different levels. There are resolution systems that are both conflict and task resolving at the same time, and ones that resolve neither. If the only way you can view task resolution is as something that is not as good as conflict resolution and is somehow opposed to it, then you don't understand much about traditional rpg writing. If you feel like this applies to you, dear reader, I recommend my write-up about <a href="http://solarwiki.janus-design.it/it/node/19" rel="nofollow">task resolution The Shadow of Yesterday</a>. It's the chapter immediately before the conflict resolution rules, and it's a related but separate topic. That game has both task and conflict resolution simultaneously as plain as day, and you need to in fact resolve tasks outside conflicts routinely, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373944/#Comment_373944" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-21T10:16:23+00:00" title="April 21, 2012 10:16AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2012 10:16AM by JDCorley.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>D&amp;D combat system is definitely a conflict resolution system for any meaningful way of using that term that I know.

I'd be happy to give my piece on the Vampire social powers mechanics, but I don't know the game nearly well enough to comment on what the text or the players actually do with those systems; to determine whether they're conflict resolution in the theoretical sense one would need to consider how easy it is to void conflicts while utilizing those mechanics. What usually makes a traditional design ineffective as conflict resolution is the GMing method that encourages hogging pacing and positioning powers to such a degree that the GM ends up as the sole decision-maker over when, why and how task resolution is used. This is the default punching bag in advocating for conflict resolution mechanics (or other explicit conflict resolution procedure; don't have to be mechanics). Having arbitrary conflict resolution attached to an exact task resolution can feel like playing D&amp;D combat with arbitrary, secret GM-controlled hit point totals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373948/#Comment_373948" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-21T11:13:34+00:00" title="April 21, 2012 11:13AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Eero said (in both his previous messages)<br/><br/>Jason, D&amp;D combat is a fixed-stakes conflict resolution with fortune at the end.

I've been playing it a lot lately, and it's really automatic and natural for me, but phrasing what is happening in exact theory terms is not easy. This is obviously further muddled because I'm not coming to it fresh, but rather from a background of a decades-old rpg culture. I have no idea if people in the '70s have thought of the same mechanical ideas we use in the same ways.<br/><br/>(Don't hold me to it, but my first stab at phrasing it is that old-school D&amp;D as we play it uses a string of miniature conflict resolutions where each monadic task/conflict is handled technically in isolation from each other, and the consequences of each are judged organically, so that nobody is in fact controlling where the events might end up - there is no narrative authority. This jumble is given its crucial backbone by legitimized player rights: the GM is obligated to "show his work", he needs to justify it before he declares drastic consequences. You can only fall to your death as the result of certain procedures, so those are followed with care. In tight situations this might even result in "redo" and "corfirmation" checks where nearly the same thing is rolled for several times to ensure that we err to the side of clarity and player rights - if e.g. a character is going to die, we'll establish the result to everybody's satisfaction. This looks superficially similar to illusionistic "roll until the result satisfies me", but the motivations and judgment over the procedures is entirely different.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373961/#Comment_373961" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-21T12:20:57+00:00" title="April 21, 2012 12:20PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2012 12:22PM by JDCorley.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I don't know the game nearly well enough to comment on what the text or the players actually do with those systems; to determine whether they're conflict resolution in the theoretical sense one would need to consider how easy it is to void conflicts while utilizing those mechanics.</blockquote>\nYou can do it with about the same ease as you can as with D&amp;D combat: "You kill the orc, and another orc walks in and attacks."<br/><br/>"You Dominate the guy into telling you everything he knows, but he doesn't know anything."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373973/#Comment_373973" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-21T15:59:48+00:00" title="April 21, 2012  3:59PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2012 4:06PM by stefoid.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>The meaning of these words, in Forge Theory, is much simpler: you don't need to take out the entire block of rules from a game to get conflict resolution, for example.  Conflict/task is ONLY about "when you roll" (or more generally, when you use your game's equivalent of a roll). Do you roll dice to see if your character is stong/fast/clever enough to pull/climb/notice something? That is task resolution, you are literally "rolling to see if you can do the task".  Or, in your game, you roll ONLY when there is a conflict between characters? That is conflict resolution.</blockquote>\nSo D&amp;D's combat system is conflict resolution.<br/><br/>(But the Climb skill is task resolution.)<br/><br/>Maybe it's not that the Internet has made me stupid, maybe the definitions are blurry and fuzzy?<br/><br/>I reckon if you stick with my definition, and call it challenge resolution, youll be fine.  <br/><br/>With stakes (in the dramatic sense of the term - like why are we fighting?), the significant question is what scope of resolution does a game allow/encourage to set?    If the scope of resolution is large enough, what is 'ultimately' at stake can be aligned with immediate intention, and resolved 'in one go'.  Otherwise stakes must be approached through successive resolutions.  This is independent of task/conflict res.<br/><br/>Those are the two vectors I find helpful to understand <br/><br/>1) does the game tell me if I achieve my intent, or does the GM?<br/>2) what scope of resolution does the game use?<br/><br/>With your example, whats at stake with the orcs?  Lets say they are trying to open the gate to let the army in.   So a permissive game might allow you to set the intention to kill ALL the orcs to be resolved.  By either task or conflict res ...  If you make your intention to kill all the orcs, and roll your combat skill, and the game says by doing that you will achieve that intention, then you achieved your stakes as well - by conflict res.  If the game says you roll the dice but the GM decides if you achieved your intention, and the GM says you did, then you have achieved your stakes via task resolution.<br/><br/>Similarly, if the game requires you to have smaller scopes of resolution, you can still use multiple conflict resolution instances to achieve the stakes.<br/><br/>In my game, dramatic stakes are aligned with goals.  Players set goals.  When play proceeds to a point where a goal is up for grabs, dice can come out.  The scope of resolution in my game is at the smaller end of the scale, so most goals (stakes) are achieved iteratively - but each resolution is confli... err, I mean challenge resolution - in other words every time you state an intention to be resolved, the resolution mechanics determines if you get it, not the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373989/#Comment_373989" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-21T22:52:21+00:00" title="April 21, 2012 10:52PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2012 11:17PM by stefoid.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            argh                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T" title="Frank T"><img alt="Frank T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T">Frank T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374062/#Comment_374062" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-23T01:37:45+00:00" title="April 23, 2012  1:37AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Confidential to the OP: "Stakes" and "conflict resolution" are both terms that tend to cause a lot of confusion about definitions.

Any player can make suggestions, and everybody should feel free to toss it around until you arrive at the right thing.<br/>What\u2019s at stake is: does your character\u2019s brother shoot the woman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>So now you only have the one 1 left. You can\u2019t See my Raise, so I win the stakes. Your character stands there with the wind out of his sails and I have my character push past and on into town, where he murders the shopkeeper\u2019s supposed wife.</blockquote>\nYou don't set Stakes like: "If I win, I get this. If you win, you get that." There is no "if X wins, Y happens". Instead you just agree on what specific thing you are fighting over. What is at stake (singular). Who wins get to say what happens. And the actions back and forth in the conflict help inform that final result. It's important not to preplay because we don't know if someone is going to Escalate from talking to shooting till we actually play which will greatly influence how we determine what happens to what is at stake. By establishing too much up front, we make a lot of the actual conflict feel forced or predictable in Dogs. <br/><br/>I think Stake Setting works great for many games.<br/><br/>For example, Stake Setting in Mouse Guard (called Conflict Goals) are awesome!\n<blockquote>Conflict Goals<br/>Each team picks a short-term or immediate goal they wish to accomplish as a result of this conflict. Conflict goals are similar to your character\u2019s session Goal. Include a statement about your character, an action and a target. <br/><br/>Lieam is ambushed by a snake. He knows the snake is going to try to kill him. He sets his goal: \u201cKill this snake so that Kenzie and Saxon are safe.\u201d <br/>The snake\u2019s goal is simple, \u201cKill this mouse so he cannot find the location of my nest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Winning a Conflict<br/>If you reduce your opponent\u2019s disposition to zero, you win the conflict. You achieve your goal. Lieam wins the conflict against the snake. He reduces the GM\u2019s disposition to 0 while his disposition is 1. He accomplishes his goal; he kills the snake. However, if you lost points from your own disposition, you have to compromise with the loser. See the Compromise heading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Losing a Conflict<br/>If your disposition is reduced to zero while your opponent has points left, you have lost. You do not accomplish your goal as stated. The snake does not kill Lieam or drive him away from its nest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Compromise<br/>If you lost, but took points off your opponent\u2019s disposition, he must offer you a compromise. Compromises are like twists, but in this case they are the result of the whole conflict, not just a failed roll. And players also get to introduce compromises, not just the GM. Once the conflict has ended, the first thing you do is compromise. The loser makes an offer to the winner, \u201cFine, you win, but\u2026\u201d The degree of the compromise should be appropriate to how much disposition the winner lost.The results of the conflict are set\u2014the winner achieved his goal, the loser did not. Now discuss an appropriate middle ground for compromise.</blockquote>\nI don't think Stake Setting is problematic in itself. <br/><br/>The problem is that Stakes became popular and was then added to games that didn't have or need it... like Dogs. <br/><br/>It's like any sort of hack. You have to be careful how your additions affect the rest of the game. <br/><br/>Although Stakes became so popular, people assumed games like Dogs already had them. Most games I've played with experienced Dogs players usually have them try to set 2 sided Stakes with some level of pre-play. I then show them in the rules where that isn't how it works and almost every time they are completely surprised!<br/><br/>But in Mouse Guard Stakes works great because it works with the design itself. We may pre-play the result slightly but the conflict itself then tell us how much of that result happens so there is a reason to play out the conflict in detail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374087/#Comment_374087" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-23T07:53:39+00:00" title="April 23, 2012  7:53AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "make a statement about the character" element is easy to overlook but IMO is the secret sauce to the whole thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374423/#Comment_374423" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T22:07:42+00:00" title="April 25, 2012 10:07PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, basically, as with any school of lit crit, setting stakes is a tool, and sometimes useful.
