James Mullen will be offering two games from a shortlist of four:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Day After Day:</b> a player-lead storygame  about the short and long term consequences to be dealt with in the aftermath of an inexplicable event in a small town; part <b>Microscope</b>, part <b>Dogs in the Vineyard</b>, in a sci-fi/horror genre.<br/></li><li><b>Just Heroes:</b> a simple <b>Apocalypse World </b>hack for playing golden or silver age superhero games; minimum prep, maximum action.<br/></li><li><b>Blood &amp; Water:</b> the storygame of <b>Being Human</b>; the past few times I've run this, it's tended towards the fae end of the spectrum in terms of PCs, so I'd like to run a session which gets back to the roots of the idea and has the housemates as characters from the horror genre, or at least dark urban fantasy.<br/></li><li><b>Excision:</b> a modern urban conspiracy/espionage game, where the PCs are renegades and mavericks forcibly recruited onto a covert team that investigates, infiltrates and dismantles any organisation seen as a threat to the state, with a genre element; think <b>Kolchak</b> meets <b>Leverage </b>by way of <b>Spooks</b>.<br/></li></ul>\nHe's after feedback as for which should run.<br/><br/>Mist77 will be offering a game of Shadowrun (blurb TBA), and we may have a game of Space: 1889 if the Kickstarter files turn up in time.<br/><br/>Keep your eyes peeled on the <a href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow_games" rel="nofollow">Concrete Cow games</a> page for all the details of the games on offer. <br/><br/><b>Safefy</b><br/>Concrete Cow now has a <a href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Harassment_and_inappropriate_conduct_policy" rel="nofollow">harassment policy</a>. I was enormously helped by the wonderful Shane who does this kind of thing for a living. The policy boils down to, "don't be a dick, and do something if you see someone else being a dick." So it's business as usual, but hopefully with some added assurance that everyone should feel safe.<br/><br/><b>Food</b><br/>We'll be doing another lunchtime curry, in the same place with the same menu.\n<ul><li>Poppadums<br/></li><li>A starter (Onion bhaji)<br/></li><li>A chicken dish (Chicken tikka masala)<br/></li><li>A lamb dish (Lamb dopiaza)<br/></li><li>A vegetable dish (Mixed vegetable curry)<br/></li><li>Pilau rice<br/></li><li>Naan</li></ul>\nand you can still order alternative vegetarian dishes at no extra charge. <br/><br/>However, the price has gone up a bit to \xa311 per head, plus drinks. I still think it's excellent value, so I hope many of you will make it!<br/><br/><b>Sign Ups</b><br/>We'll be experimenting with a slight change to the sign-up sheet system. <br/><br/>We'll be holding back all the sign-up sheets until 9.30am. <br/><br/>Hopefully, this will mean that people don't have to turn up at 9.00am (or earlier!) to get a choice of games.<br/><br/><b>Academic conference attendance</b><br/>And finally, I've now had official confirmation that I won't be at Concrete Cow again. I'll be attending the same conference I was at this time last year, spreading the word to everyone about <a href="http://codeclub.org.uk" rel="nofollow">Code Club</a>! Scott and Andy will be doing the requisite cat-herding on the day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428138/#Comment_428138" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-08T13:29:44+00:00" title="February  8, 2014  1:29PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot's been happening with Concrete Cow in the last week or so.
