His attractive but conservatively-dressed Danish "security" associate Maja Jorgensen is watching calmly from a nearby table. The croupiers' attention is set to be distracted by fellow-political exile "artist" Cesar Galan, who is doing a brash corporate photoshoot of a very hot Irish model named Freja MacTavish, who strangely looks much like Maja. Only Freja is dressed in a sexy red and white one-piece swimsuit with a red "Coca-Cola" sash across her chest, pageant style.<br/><br/>Rubino is set to roll the dice when <a href="http://gal.darkervision.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/frank_sinatra_young.jpg" rel="nofollow">Frank Sinatra</a> walks off stage after his last performance and strides right over to Freja. "You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. Come with me and sit at my table next to the stage while I do my next set. I'm Frank Sinatra."<br/><br/>Three pairs of eyes look aghast as a star-struck Maja walks off with Ol' Blue Eyes. What just happened their their model (and distraction)??<br/><br/>Thinking quickly, Maja does a Jamie Lee Curtis in True Lies. She pulls a red and white table cloth off a nearby table, and quickly turns it into an off the shoulder gown. Pulls her hair from it's tight bun and lets it hang down in long tresses. Then sauntered over to Rubino and blows on the "hot" dice in his fist. "Good luck".<br/><br/>Next time we see Freya is when she washes up dead on a Havana beach several days later.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370572/#Comment_370572" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-02T06:11:35+00:00" title="April  2, 2012  6:11AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Frank tangent: "I'm gonna live live live until I die!"

I enter a room strewn with old bones and dried blood. The ghost is a morbidly obese man with a chainsaw. I run but, my backpack gets caught on something. The ghost is feeling me up my leg. I kick it and run, trip and lose my headlamp, skittering in the dark. I run through the dark and scream as the chainsaw cuts me down.<br/><br/>I'm the ghosts. An urban spelunker finds a room inexplicably adorned like a living room in the abandoned subbasements. An overpowering smell of urine and medication fills the air. There's an old lady there, calling him by an unknown name, and trying to touch his face. He runs and is cornered, tries to hide, but the ghosts find him. He wants to get away and they are very angry. A piece of overhead piping explodes and shrapnel pierces him through the chest as he slumps down next to the wall.<br/><br/>I think that's 75% victories for the ghosts of all the games I've played so far. But I expect it will get higher, the escapes were really lucky breaks.<br/><br/>I still haven't tried to do "D&amp;D with MG" however, need to do that asap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370734/#Comment_370734" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-02T15:01:47+00:00" title="April  2, 2012  3:01PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>I still haven't tried to do "D&amp;D with MG" however, need to do that asap.</blockquote>\n...?!

We were passing through High Elf territory as guests, when dark-and-high elves (sent by the Elf Queen, in a move against The Druid) show up and attack. We survive. In the process, the Bad Elves (combo of two races) had set fires in town (which we helped put out), killed many innocents (we immediately tended to the injured), etc.<br/><br/>Anyway, one of the surviving high elves in charge comes over as we're tying up the enemy high elf general with rope for judging/sentencing, and he begins to argue with me. Basically casting doubt on us, that we were somehow responsible for the disaster, that we were somehow "in on it" as some sort of elaborate ruse.<br/><br/>Me (as Konstantinos Arissa The Dark Elf): "Indeed, sir? You are implicating us in this attack? An attack, I might remind you, sir, that we barely survived ourselves? ("I show him the holes in my tunic from sword slashes") The fires in your city that we are currently putting out? Creating the injured that we are currently attending to? All we intended to do was to pass through your wood, and in the process saved you and your city. And you implicate us in this treachery? I have more of your wounded to attend to, so you will allow me to pass. <b><i>Good day, sir</i></b>."<br/><br/>GM (as high elf): "Yes, but it could have all..."<br/><br/>Me: to GM: "Hey, I said good day sir!" (remembering in the last battle that their MD/Mental Defense was 13) (I roll myself a charisma check with IIRC my courtesan or noble background, I forget which, in front of the GM; I pass exceedingly)<br/><br/>Me: "<b><i>I said, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Good Day, Sir</span>!</i></b>"<br/><br/>GM (immediately): The high elf looks stunned and shamed, and lets you carry on.<br/><br/>The system?

The party confronts and defeats a green slime, an ogre, ten zombies and two bugbears in quick succession.  Essential elements of the victory are the Turn Undead ability and curing spells of the two clerics included in the party.  Don\u2019t fight undead without clerics!  The best part is, we rescue a gnome merchant and his assistants who agree to handle the sale of all loot taken from the Moat House and future explorations, for a small fee.  Derived from the weapons carried by the two bugbears, we incorporate the Morningstar Merchant Company, with the crossed morningstars hanging above the entry to the rented emporium.  With his earnings, our ranger fulfills a lifelong dream and buys a warhorse.  Our wizard meets with the Hommlet leadership and is provided a Find Familiar spell\u2014which he promptly does.

This time I was MC and she was the helpless victim.  Per her request, we skinned the game with a post-apocalyptic setting.  And no, she doesn't know about Apocalypse World, so that was my own secret amusement as I mixed and matched my lumpley games.<br/><br/>Silva, in search of food and gasoline, climbed to the top floors of a skyscraper that had been mostly reclaimed by nature.  In one room she found human bones piled like wood for a campfire.  They had gnaw marks on them.  She investigated the cabinets in the room finding a knife and an empty canteen.  When she turned around again there was a figure sitting Indian style holding up and examining each bone in one of the piles with a disturbingly keen amount of interest.  It did not look at her as she feared it would; instead it cocked its head ever so slightly and <i>smelled</i> her.  It stood up and started closing the distance between them, never looking at Silva but always testing the air for her appetizing aroma.  Silva froze in fear as the creature neared and finally turned to look at her with hunger in its eyes.  Silva turned to flee, but noticed that what used to be piles of only bone were now piles of bone and flesh.  The piles began unfolding themselves into mockeries of the people they used to be.  Silva tried to sprint past them, but as they flailed about like broken dolls they knocked into her and knocked her down.  The ghost loomed above her, grinning a wolf's smile.<br/><br/>I often find little mechanical hitches when I play Murderous Ghosts (like, should I be turning pages here, or, wait, is this a loop I'm supposed to be in?) but I am <i>always</i> creeped out by it.

Literally right in the middle of a decisive combat.<br/><br/>So to build that tension back up, and to carry us a little farther than memory, we played Mist Robed Gate.  Players generated exaggerated, mythic versions of themselves.<br/><br/>After we catch up to the point from two weeks ago, we keep on in MRG.<br/><br/>Yu-chen abandons Kian Hwe and Mo Yin to face the dreaded, hundred bladed Poison from Beneath the Dark Mountain so that she can catch up with Temu, the massive wolf who is responsible for the death of her "patron."  Temu [hands her the knife] and demands that she yield and let Temu escape to the Northern Desert to be with his tribe.<br/>Yu-chen cannot do this willingly, [and plunges the knife into Temu's sheet] demanding that he fight with her one last time.<br/>The massive wolf splits the very earth beneath Yu-Chen's feet, freezes her in an icy sorcerous spell, and uses Kian Hwe's slave as hostage in the fight, but Yu-chen fights on, weilding her jade staff with fire and wrath.<br/><br/>All votes in, and Temu stands victorious.  [The knife is calmed, Temu is not in threat of death.]  "You have found your tribe, go to them, little horse-dog-friend  I will return to mine."<br/><br/>Elsewhere, Mo Yin manages to not only steal the Gilded Axe from the Great Poison, but also to shear off several of his arms.  (Mo Yin in Jadeclaw is an amputee, but in his Legend he is able to control a force equal to a phantom fist.)  The Poison retreats back to it's cave.

The plane is out of control and will crash unless something is done!

From there, he uses his kinetic powers to guide the aircraft to an emergency landing in the East River, next to Riker's Island.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, Dr. Gust--a flying teleporter--confronts Electro and attempts to intimidate him into surrendering.  Electro laughs in Dr. Gust's face, and follows up with an electricity blast to same!

The Long Range Desert Group raiders are traveling 300 miles behind enemy lines to strike an Italian airfield. Armed with trucks...with guns on them. The group is using a captured Italian truck, loaded w explosives and fuel and driven by a LRDG soldier wearing an Italian uniform, to lead the raid and hopefully trick the gun emplacements for enough time to get past them.<br/><br/>The Leftenant totally blows his 'Engagement' roll, and the raiders get stuck in a hidden minefield. In close range of the enemy guns. With the lead truck destroyed and on fire and the British driver thrown to the ground in the midst of the mines.<br/><br/>The ex-driver says "I want to run through the minefield and straight at the gun emplacement. Then pull a sticky-bomb off my back, throw it in, and dive to the ground." Then he proceeds to roll a maximum success using the 'Are You Crazy??' move.<br/><br/>And then we imagined the "busted two ranks from a sergeant to a PFC for letting his men get slaughtered while he hid in the basement of a house clutching a metal chess pawn" alcoholic soldier do exactly what he described.

Amina's antics in the torture chamber  spawned the catchphrase of the evening: All the maids drinking 40s in the basement.<br/><br/>The second half got a bit better. The maids banded together to save master Crowley from a monstrous creature who looked like Marlon Brando in his <i>Island of Dr. Moreau</i> phase. The creature turned out to be Kiki's vampire grandfather and the vampire who turned Amina into a vampire. Kiki's a vampire, too, yes.<br/><br/>Nazar was visited by the old ninja who raised her in the ninja village. He gave her a giant Texas-sized T-Bone steak to boost her strength. He rerminded her of purpose: to help Crowley rule as the evil emporer he's destined to be.

This weapon prevents the Crimson Blades from airlifting safely away from the Ossen Mutark dungeons, so they decide to storm it!<br/><br/>Prime excitement moment: at one point, the bard/sorcerer is low on hit points and is cornered by two wraith-dwarves.  I am giddy, for I think I am going to bag a bard-sorceror tonight.  But then that wretched PC uses her Thunder Leap burst power to lay big hurt on both wraiths and jump to safety.   Curses!<br/><br/>When wraiths are hit, they turn invisible and teleport, so I take their minis off the table and note their new location secretly.  The bard-sorceror studies the battlefield to select the landing point of her Thunder Leap and decides to land <i>right in the middle of the same invisible wraiths who just teleported away from her!</i>  I struggle to contain my glee!  I have thwarted her escape.  Alas, my glee evaporates when the bard-sorcerer informs me that <i>her power does a heavy damage burst at her landing point as well.</i>  Both wraiths are hit by the burst.  Of course, the damage from this lucky break is decisive.   NEXT TIME GADGET.<br/><br/>With the wraiths defeated and the gun destroyed, the Blades airlift out of the dungeon, back towards Greyhawk.  They left dozens of their henchmen back in the lofty halls of Ossen Mutark.  All of the fortune-seekers who joined them for their northern expedition -- the silverhorn minotaurs, the Greyhawk ski archers, the halfling river wardens, the Suel refugee fighters -- all are dead.  Only the flock of kenku transmuters survived.  These crow-man scavengers had tagged along with the Blades in the hopes of scoring some meals during the short rests that follow encounters.

Curry Rice is already delicious enough, but Heroin Curry Rice is apparently the bomb.<br/><br/>Twists, turns, evidence, secrets and one long courtroom scene later, pretty much everyone was utterly destroyed save for the gangster. The chemistry researcher's player rolled a final ZERO: His epilogue was being caught by the yakuza, and the next scene is him working in a jungle drug plantation in southeast Asia for a person with an M16 slung over his shoulder and only 6 words of broken Japanese "You work hard now or dead", for the rest of his (probably not too long) life.<br/><br/>It was really interesting seeing how people in Japan came to decisions on whether to give White or Black dice. There's not as much of a dominant (like Jason M often does) ringleader dude to nod to everyone while pushing a die forward. There tended to be a little more debate, with people a little more hesitant about pushing a die forward unless everyone swung that way.<br/><br/>But you know what? I told everyone that this game requires people to bring their A game, and they F'ing brought it, every single player (I only met two of them before); from scene one the game was on fire. No one turtled. There might have been a pause here and there, but when it was time to play a role Roles Were Played.

A sound none of them had ever heard before.<br/><br/>"Shit," whisper Malic.<br/><br/>"Come on! We set up a defense at the bottom of the stairs!" shouted Gerthin. The slaves would have to wait in their chains. The outcome of this bellowed challenge would decide their fate, as well as the fate of our heros.<br/><br/>A bed roll set on fire and thrown up the stairs, a momentary distraction, a slight delay.<br/><br/>A hasty barricade is erected at the base of the stairs. X, Frida and Arianne rush to defend it. Drinks Blood and two of the men at arms slip in behind them to stiffen the front line.<br/><br/>Malic, Gerthin, Guy and Gam hastily push a row of barrels together and duck between them and the wall, taking cover.<br/><br/>The archer, Drew takes up station in the middle of the room to get the best field of fire, while remaining out of the way of the fighters at the barricade.<br/><br/>The set up took seconds. Gerthin shouting terse, tense orders.<br/><br/>Another roar. A cackling laugh. A voice, not the roarer, shouting imprecations, promising doom. The sound of hooves on stone. <br/><br/>Silence.<br/><br/>A heartbeat.<br/><br/>Sweat beading down the face, despite the underground chill.<br/><br/>A breath.<br/><br/>Dark shapes moving down the stairs towards them. Another roar, impossibly deep.<br/><br/>Drinks Blood whispers, "No. The Bull God."<br/><br/>Malic answers him, "Shit." as he fishes a scroll from his pack.<br/><br/>They're coming. Arianne flinging a spell at them, some fall, crumple before the ersatz wooden wall. One of the spear men thrusting over the barricade to finish them.<br/><br/>But there's more. They're still coming.<br/><br/>The voice. The roar.<br/><br/>Coming. <br/><br/>Down.<br/><br/>\u2026a flash of flickering fire light flies up the stairs. Malic looks up, the remains of a scroll blackening to ash in hands. His eyes follow the little ball of light. Which erupts into an impossibly large ball of light, a wall of flames, rushing, hungry, devouring. The dark figures fall, consumed. The voice stops.<br/><br/>Flames crackle, lick at the barricade.<br/><br/>A hush. A moment.<br/><br/>Then\u2026the roar, again. He's\u2026still coming, flesh dripping from his bones, one eye rolling wildly in the socket, he roars. He emerges, wreathed in flames, bellowing his fury!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Davis" title="Daniel Davis"><img alt="Daniel Davis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Davis">Daniel Davis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373912/#Comment_373912" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-21T00:18:23+00:00" title="April 21, 2012 12:18AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [DEATH FROST DOOM - MILD SPOILERS!]<br/>\n<br/>\nFuller writeup here: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.lotfp.com/RPG/discussion/topic/318/death-frost-doom-part-1-burn-everything-and-play-the-organ/" rel="nofollow">Burn Everything, and Play the Organ</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only things they didn't burn were the deer head, the purple lotus powder, and the mirror.<br/>\n<br/>\nMINER's eyes lit up when he found the lotus powder.

We're a bunch of evil scrubs - a poncy ranger, an elven bard who is basically the second coming of Leon Trotsky, a wizard who'd prefer to stab you in the kidney than use magic, and two worshipers of the Bear God, a cleric and a paladin, played by Robo and me. The Bear God apparently wants us to be pompous thugs, and we don't disappoint. We're on a mission to take the eviller-than-us hand of some lich-king to some observatory where it can be destroyed. The usual.<br/><br/>The elf gets kidnapped by reptile god cultists and we go after her. Deep underground we're ambushed by the gigantic crocodile servitor of the reptile god and it nearly kills Robo's cleric and my paladin. We're both down to 2 hit points before the thing gets put down (the ranger's dog, Pepper, is our most effective combatant). The cleric and the paladin have bonds - we're co-religionists, we're arrogant bastards, we love and trust each other implicitly. Naturally, being a priest of the Bear God, the cleric didn't bother to take any wussy healing spells, but my paladin can lay on hands! I'll help my friend out, so I roll the dice.<br/><br/>7.<br/><br/>With the paladin's Lay on Hands move, a 7-9 means I cure 1d8 but take the damage myself. So suddenly I'm praying I only heal 1 point, because anything else will kill me. <br/><br/>I roll an 8.<br/><br/>So the cleric is filled with healing energy as I give him the last of my guy's own vitality, and the paladin dies praising the Bear God's icy judgment. Then I make the Last Breath move and again roll a 7.<br/><br/>With the Last Breath move, a 7-9 means Death shows up and makes a deal with you, take it or leave it. Steve asks me what the Bear God's afterlife looks like. I say you know, everybody is fighting and fucking and messing with acolytes of the harvest goddess, it is pretty awesome. Steve says I see beyond the black gates and there's nothing. If the Bear God even exists he doesn't give a shit about me. My whole faith is a lie.<br/><br/>But there's a lich-king who could use my services...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374302/#Comment_374302" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T06:26:16+00:00" title="April 25, 2012  6:26AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, after these last five (or four) reports I'm super-pumped to play/run some D&amp;D again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374346/#Comment_374346" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T13:01:22+00:00" title="April 25, 2012  1:01PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the Kerberos Club Fate game, all the players know that Lord Gregory Sage is really Gregory's trusted servant, Reginald, a shapechanger, but the only PC who knows this is Reginald.

She was doing the right thing, but it still didn't save her.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374622/#Comment_374622" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T17:56:00+00:00" title="April 26, 2012  5:56PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2012 6:07PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man, Archipelago II, so good. We're the terminal crew on a generation ship returning to Earth after it stopped talking to our colony 200 years ago. Hard-ish science fiction, sort of a lonely, creepy Alien vibe. We decided the awake crews have these rigid sociological conditions to keep them from murdering each other and that there is no hierarchy, everything is put to a vote. And now things are getting weird, the semi-sapient AI robots are suddenly refusing orders, there's an anomalous stream of neutrinos coming from Europa, and we just thawed the military guy per protocol but he's gone apeshit because his wife died in her tube 57 years ago. My guy is the awake crew psychologist but I've managed to convince everyone he's A-OK (My destiny point this session was "you find someone on the edge of a psychotic break but cover it up").<br/><br/>We have no idea what's going on but I own "Earth/mystery" and I'm going to make it awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374783/#Comment_374783" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T16:59:42+00:00" title="April 27, 2012  4:59PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nobilis<br/><br/>Avengers style with the Powers of America, Iron, Thunder, and Anger.<br/><br/>CaptaIn Mar Vell (an excrucian Warmain) launched an attack on New York city, with racist stereotypes of "Red" Chinese soldiers and cartoonish bombs.<br/><br/>My take away is I either don't get Warmains, or I don't like them.

I have no idea how she's going to take to Pocket Danger Patrol. I lay out the styles and roles and let people start picking. Nora says "I'm playing a Ghost Daredevil. My name is Kneivel."<br/><br/>So the ghost of Evel Kneival, a Robot Professor (of women's studies), and a Psychic Pilot take on Stygian Adepts, a sentient alien timebom, and two rival atomics left over from the war in s stasis bubble. At one point the Professor attempts to defeat the bomb by transcending gender roles (don't ask me what that means). Instead the bomb infects the professor with it's own band of apocalyptic nihilism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374801/#Comment_374801" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T19:14:17+00:00" title="April 27, 2012  7:14PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ribbon Drive @ Story Games Seattle<br/><br/>First song, "Amish Paradise".

I have massively screwed up "designing" the encounters - they're clearly broken and the characters are on their last legs with almost no resources left. I decide to trigger an event that was intended to come up once the characters were much closer to their stated goal.<br/><br/>The Gaunt Man, who wishes to wipe out what life remains on Athas so that he can become the first of the new gods and recreate the world in his image, walks slowly toward the fight in progress and holds up his hand. The creatures vanish. "You seem to be... overmatched. I am the New World. Will you serve?"<br/><br/>All three characters give a steely stare and reply, "No." (Well, one says more diplomatically, "We had hoped for a better world.")<br/><br/>The Gaunt Man's hand goes up again. "Perhaps I haven't made my offer clear. Perform one task for me and I will grant you power enough to survive, and no one will know. Do not, and you will surely die." At a gesture, the storm elementals reappear.<br/><br/>"What is the task?" the characters ask.<br/><br/>"Kill the girl." (The girl is the child-priest that certain prophecies say is the only one who can resolve the battle going on between Nibenay's sorceror-king and a powerful elemental force without bringing a cataclysmic disaster down upon the city and perhaps the world.)<br/><br/>"No," says the escaped gladiator-slave.<br/><br/>"No," says the half-elf mage.<br/><br/>"Okay," says the half-giant with the arm of a warrior and the heart of a merchant. The other players look at the half-giant's player, and he says in a low voice, "I want to live."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374985/#Comment_374985" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-29T20:37:35+00:00" title="April 29, 2012  8:37PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First-ever playtest of Traveller World.<br/><br/>15 minutes in we had the first death during character generation.

In this variant, loser D-list superheroes try to save the city after all the major-league heroes have been killed off.<br/><br/>The team consisted of Mother, a woman who can give birth to anything; Refractor, who has special mirror/light abilities and talks in a very loud anime voice; and Phoenix, who has a plastic beak and can come back from the dead.<br/><br/>The game's played with Mah Jongg tiles, and you have to play x-of-a-kind (two of a kind, three of a kind, whatever), depending on the difficulty level presented to you by the DM. If you can't play, you can always score points by griefing the other players in various ways.<br/><br/>Interesting thing happened: in previous games, the characters played characters that were villainous, or suspicious of one another. But in this game, they were somewhat aspirational -- a bunch of bush-league wannabes with something to prove.<br/><br/>As a result, there wasn't much griefing at all. Instead, the players wound up helping each other out. They defeated the aliens and saved the city. But they took a lot of damage, and two of them died (one of them being the Phoenix, who came back shortly thereafter). Had they done more griefing and adversarial gameplay, instead of co-op, they could have avoided death. Clearly, the setting colored their gameplay choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375824/#Comment_375824" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-02T05:24:02+00:00" title="May  2, 2012  5:24AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafael</cite>The team consisted of Mother, a woman who can give birth to anything; Refractor, who has special mirror/light abilities and talks in a very loud anime voice; and Phoenix, who has a plastic beak and can come back from the dead.</blockquote>\nThis is my favorite superhero team forever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375825/#Comment_375825" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-02T05:29:52+00:00" title="May  2, 2012  5:29AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2012 5:34AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We're playing Dungeon World, my paladin is at 0 HP so I'm playing my AWOL brother's skanky wizard, Xeno.

Basically the premise is that Jason gets the ability, somehow, to travel to any Friday the 13th in history. Einstein discovers this, deduces what's going on, and then travels through time to gather up the people he mathematically calculates Jason will attack in order to prevent the unraveling of space time at the hands of a machete wielding manchild.<br/><br/>I fell victim to my own rules when I was able to successfully safeguard the Buddha all the way to the end of the game (every time Jason turned towards him, the Buddha would meet his gaze, his eyes full of sadness and compassion, and Jason would turn away) but the player who got narration rights narrated the final scene as a 70s dance off between the Buddha and Jason. So much for wresting any kind of poignance from a game containing Vlad the Impaler, Carl Sagan, and Charles Schultz as PCs.

Fast forward a while and the Lady Blackbird had stowed away on another smugglers ship, Naomi had blown herself (and a small Imperial base) in to the blue and Captain Vance had commandeered a mid-sized Imperial frigate. After intercepting the Lady, he found the Owl. The Captain was also rightfully pissed off at Snargle for stealing his ship. Snargle, who had done so because he was tired of the mindless murder and mayhem Vance and the others were spreading decided there was no way he was going to survive this and so rammed the frigate at full speed just as Kale <em>attempted</em> to cut the engines.</p>\n<p>This failed (I say, Snargle put the Owl half way through the hull of the frigate but killed neither Snargle or Vance) and when Vance pulled Kale and Snargle off the ship, he teleported Snargle in to the blue.</p>\n<p>Later that evening, I got an IM from Vance's player who apologised for killing Snargle, but I'd crossed a line.
