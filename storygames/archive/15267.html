Personally, I think the definition is bunko. When children play Tea Party we call that a game. When children pretend their dolls are having a dance, we call that a game too... the toy is the thing being manipulated by the game, not the game itself, but, like <b>story </b>the word <b>game</b> has a lot of loaded implications in both the world at large and the RPG community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346753/#Comment_346753" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-24T07:01:42+00:00" title="October 24, 2011  7:01AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2011 8:28AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Will Wright calls <i>Sim City</i> a "software toy", if that's a useful analogy to you.<br/><br/>"Toy" in the context of tabletop has always had a positive connotation to me, a sandbox-y game where you generate your own win conditions, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346754/#Comment_346754" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-24T07:15:11+00:00" title="October 24, 2011  7:15AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Try some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game#Ludwig_Wittgenstein" rel="nofollow">Wittgenstein</a>, it won't help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/norbertgmatausch" title="norbertgmatausch"><img alt="norbertgmatausch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/412/n6C0O3XAEQ2GP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/norbertgmatausch">norbertgmatausch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346757/#Comment_346757" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-24T07:37:07+00:00" title="October 24, 2011  7:37AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2011 7:37AM by norbertgmatausch.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My personal impression is that "toy" in a rpg context is most often used as a weapon against people who play games that are very freeform-y. In the sense of "we play <i>games</i>, but you just play with <i>toys</i>". I don't know if this is what really happens, of course. But I've gotten this impression a lot over the years.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346763/#Comment_346763" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-24T08:38:47+00:00" title="October 24, 2011  8:38AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not using it as a weapon. I'm not even trying to attack the fellow that enjoys Perfected. I'm just saying that<i> Perfected</i> doesn't have enough structure or answer enough questions for it to really be considered a game. A toy is a thing that you can do fun stuff with, but isn't a game. Take Daniel Solis's <i>Writer's Dice</i> for example. That's a toy. Can you play a game with it? Yup, and I even purchased a pair. But the fact remains that<i> Writer's Dice</i>, a physical toy (or tool, if you like) not too far removed from the metaphorical toy (or tool) that is <i>Perfected</i>, are not in and of themselves a game. Can you play with it? Yes. Does that make it a game? No. A game is something you<i> play</i>, whereas a toy is something you play <i>with</i>. Does that mean I dislike it? No, I'd play with that in the backseat of the car on a road trip with friends, but while you can make a game out of it, that page is not a game in and of itself in the same way that, say, a roleplaying poem is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of that image like it was a tower of <i>Jenga </i>blocks. The tower of blocks is a toy that can be fun to play with. You can build things with the blocks and knock them down, you can play pretend with them, you can play "<b>2001: A Space Oddysey/2010: Oddysey Two</b>" with them, pretending they are monoliths, heck, you can pretend they are carrot sticks if you like, I don't mind. But <i>Jenga </i>blocks are not a game unless you know the rules. Can it be hacked? Absolutely! Hacking is awesome, just look at the Donkey Kong version! but in the end, it isn't the blocks, but a distinct and complete set of rules for what to do with the blocks that makes it a game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion, therefore, Perfected is a pile of wooden blocks that you can do with whatever you like, which to me smacks more of a toy than a game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this doesn't hurt anyone's feelings, but if it does, I'd love to know why. Why would it in the slightest invalidate your fun if you were playing a game you made up which utilizes a certain toy vs. playing a game that already is a game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346764/#Comment_346764" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-24T08:39:14+00:00" title="October 24, 2011  8:39AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, what Morningstar said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346769/#Comment_346769" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-24T09:21:11+00:00" title="October 24, 2011  9:21AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First off, thanks a lot UserClone.

"Catch" is in itself a goal. The football is a toy. <br/><br/>I didn't use "playing" here because it's cheating to call "playing" a goal and use that to prove something is a game. You can play with toys, and you can play games.<br/><br/>Stacking blocks is a game, though a simple one. "Stacking" is a goal. The blocks are toys.<br/><br/>"Monopoly" has goals built into the rules. If you "play Monopoly," you more or less abide by some set of rules, which include or imply goals. In the case of Monopoly, there's a victory condition everyone should strive for. The rules are more important than the game materials for defining what Monopoly is. In fact, people clone the game materials and change them around all the time (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Monopoly" rel="nofollow">My Monopoly</a>). If you played with the board, houses, tokens, and money from a Monopoly game but didn't know the rules, I think most people would agree you were not "playing Monopoly." At worst, you are using the pieces as a toy. At best, you've created a new game by introducing your own rules, structure, and goals.<br/><br/>Role-playing games are more complicated. A lot of them don't really explain what a player's goals are, but players seem to know what their goals are anyway. The RPG itself might not be a game without that creative input, but most people know how to use it correctly. It's as if the actual victory conditions were absent from Monopoly, but everyone at the table knew that you were supposed to "win" by accumulating more money than everyone else. <br/><br/>Imagine an RPG that has just a character generator, and nothing else. Is that a game yet?<br/><br/>Imagine an RPG with a character generator, a rule that says "roll d20 to figure out if you succeed," and no setting, implied or otherwise. Is that a game yet?<br/><br/>Imagine the same game, but with an explicit rule for accomplishing tasks, but nothing implying what kind of tasks a character can do. This is very difficult, because skills and attributes suggest goals, right? But imagine that the character's only stat is "EFFECTIVENESS" and that you roll 2d6 + EFFECTIVENESS and if it's 8 or higher, you succeed. Is that a game yet?<br/><br/>Now, I haven't read Jocelyn's thing yet, so I don't have any opinion about it. But I have opinions about where toy stops and game starts and how to apply those ideas to role-playing games.

I didn't say it was "just" anything. I said that it wasn't this thing, it was that thing, in my opinion. And I fail to see how my opinion isn't valid. Others seem to agree that a single rule like that one doesn't constitute an RPG. There is no context. There is no theme. There is no experience to be had. There is nothing against which to struggle. There is no goal. There is no problem to solve. There is just two guys, telling a story about anything they want, and dicing off to see who gets to decide the next part. That's a potentially very fun activity, but I would not classify it as a game, really. And certainly that bare mechanic is not in and of itself a game, though, as seems obvious to me, you can easily make a game out of doing it (which is what the guy in the other thread was doing).<br/><br/>It isn't a pejorative anymore than my saying that <i>Jenga</i> blocks aren't a game, without the context of a set of agreed-upon rules, like either the classic <i>Jenga</i> rules or <i>Dread.</i> Both of those things are games, and in both cases, the tower of blocks is not a game, but the means with which one can play a game. The <i>Perfected</i> mechanic is analogous to the blocks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346842/#Comment_346842" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-24T16:54:07+00:00" title="October 24, 2011  4:54PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite>Why is making that distinction necessarily pejorative?</blockquote>\nPeople aren't attacking you, man.

I'd rather focus on the enjoyment of the "players" and not worry about if the goal is tough or competitive enough.<br/><br/>Granted, this opens up the can of worms that basically something like knitting is a game, in the sense that you are doing for personal enjoyment; but ultimately, there will be some set of goals and rules within a game of knitting that might not be apparent...things like "I want to get the sleeve done by tonight," and "best looking sweater ever," which align pretty nicely to the silly achievement lists that modern videogames have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346853/#Comment_346853" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-24T20:23:29+00:00" title="October 24, 2011  8:23PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Although I think the toy/game distinction is functional.

(2) What's the minimum amount of structure a game requires to actually be a game? What's the tipping point between toy and game, so to speak?</blockquote>\nTo me the tipping point is when method overtakes function in importance.  A d6 is a random number generator, I can do lots of things with it (some that don't even include number generation).  It becomes part of a game when the method of its use becomes of primary import.<br/><br/>Words on a piece of paper can be used for a lot of purposes.  The game emerges when we have a method of determining those words and how they work together.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SentientGames</cite>Will Wright describes SimCity as a software toy, but does that mean it's not a game? Ask anyone what "SimCity" is and they'll tell it you it's a video game.</blockquote>\nI think calling it a "video game" has more to do with the term as a colloquialism to mean pretty much any form of interactive entertainment found on computers of various shapes and sizes (there are examples within that definition that are not video games though).  The idea that SimCity is a toy and not a game comes from the fact that most people invent their own goals and purposes for their use of the program.  Even a "sandbox" game like Grand Theft Auto has some pretty well defined limits of what you can and can't do, you have a lot of "freedom" but it's mostly an illusion and the vast majority of people will use it to attempt to reach it's intended goal, telling a story.<br/><br/>SimCity on the other hand doesn't really have a goal, or express purpose.  You can set very different goals from the person on the computer next to you and these goals can be so different that even though you are using the same tool, "success" will be measured completely differently and look completely different as well.  It's like saying that a professional NBA game and a game of H-O-R-S-E are the same thing, they're not even close.  They're related and there are some similarities, particularly in the toys/tools used, but the game is extremely different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346905/#Comment_346905" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-25T11:40:28+00:00" title="October 25, 2011 11:40AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 25, 2011 11:40AM by UserClone.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very good points there, Garret.

I think part of the problem is the use of the term "toy" specifically and what that term means to different people. To some people, it's just a term used to describe an implement for play. But for some people, it can have the (sometimes negative) connotation of something that isn't serious or belongs in the hands of a child. I know that not everyone who label's a self-proclaimed-rpg a toy does so with negative intentions, but it should be somewhat understood that the designer of said rpg could take offense. Consider these parallels...<br/><br/>"It's not so much a song as it is a jingle..."<br/><br/>"It's not so much a painting as it as a doodle..."<br/><br/>"It's not so much a sculpture as it is a wad of clay..."<br/><br/>My point is, people are obviously on two sides of the fence on this topic, so it may be an issue of political correctness, but out of respect for your fellow rpg-enthusiasts and designers, it's probably not the best approach. You're throwing at term at someone that can possibly be misconstrued as a bad thing, even if that's not how you intended it. The way they see it, you're basically saying that what they intended to be one thing is actually something less. Instead of calling it a "toy", why not call it a "tool"? Does it not accomplish the same thing without the potential negative connotations? If you don't consider it a game in and of itself, then would "tool" not be another way to say that without attaching what a lot of people would consider an insult?<br/><br/>I also think there's a huge difference in what people are considering "goals". SimCity out of the box has a goal, plus many self-made optional ones. Do you start with a new plot of land and not build anything? No, you have an inherent goal of building a city. Do you leave your buildings unconnected to the power grid? No, there is the inherent goal of connecting your buildings to the power plants. While those goals might not count as a game to you, they do to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346921/#Comment_346921" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-25T16:32:17+00:00" title="October 25, 2011  4:32PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>Candy Land is a game to most people, and its useful in some context to understand it as such.</blockquote>\nCandy Land is a particularly interesting example.<br/><br/>Many folks, myself included, would argue that, in addition to goals of some sort, an activity needs to have some sort of influence of skill or choice in order for it to be a game.<br/><br/>Candy Land has absolutely zero influence from skill or choice. There are no choices. There is absolutely no way to do better or worse at a game of Candy Land. Once the deck has been shuffled, the activity is 100% scripted from that point on. The absolute only way to influence the outcome of the game is to somehow change the order in which the cards are drawn - for example, to go to the bathroom and take so long that the other players decide to skip your turn.<br/><br/>Because of that, I would argue that Candy Land is not a game. It is an activity. Even though it has goals. Even though you can win.<br/><br/>For an example of a similar activity, take out a coin. Call heads or tails. Flip the coin. If you called correctly you win. However, your choice was not meaningful. You weren't playing a game.<br/><br/>The inclusion of meaningful choice or skill, however, is a bit more controversial when it comes to defining a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346925/#Comment_346925" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-25T17:32:49+00:00" title="October 25, 2011  5:32PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SentientGames</cite> Instead of calling it a "toy", why not call it a "tool"?

He meant "toy" positively. Perhaps, he suggested, SimCity wasn't really a game at all. It was just a thing that was fun to play with.<br/><br/>Greg Costikyan then extended the distinction, by adding a definition to it. I think the definition is interesting for discussion, but not to be taken as truth.<br/><br/>Since then, the phrase "This isn't a game, it's a toy" has been adopted as a perjorative way of dissing games that don't look like the games you're used to. Used that way, I think it's worthless.<br/><br/>Remember that, in the original conception, "Toy" was a positive thing. In a recent talk, Tom Chatfield suggested we all design better toys. I agree with him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346996/#Comment_346996" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-26T13:53:27+00:00" title="October 26, 2011  1:53PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 26, 2011 1:54PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite>...good idea?

Apologies for sounding obtuse, but that was the point of my last post. It might be an issue of political correctness (lame as that sounds), but  "tool" is probably a better term to use when giving critical comments to a fellow designer to avoid the potential pejorative meaning. As far as the argument of what is and isn't a toy/game, I'd have to say that it is largely subjective and depends on what you consider to be goals that then qualify the activity as a game.<br/><br/>Interesting discussion though.
