It was pretty fun to go through the schedule picking out games for him. In every slot I gave him at least two choices -- games fill up, so he needed a Plan B -- and he got a good sampling out of it. Most of them, I knew the GM or could make a good guess at the game's quality from the reputation of the system and/or GM ("People seem to like that Happy Jack's podcast, so... that guy should be okay, right?"), but a couple of them were a total crapshoot, like that Traveller game that went south. Shitty that was his first RPG experience, but at least he had nowhere to go but up from there. And go up he did, because right after that was Fiasco, which blew his God-damned mind. <br/><br/>I <i>think</i> we're finally going to get to play D&amp;D together this Sunday at my FLGS -- we've both played with that group separately so far, but not together -- and hopefully we can expose him to some other games soon. Maybe I can get him to come down to Hyphen-Con for, uh, research purposes. The Hyph's almost all indie games this year (except for that GURPS My Little Pony game...).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368782/#Comment_368782" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-21T09:17:44+00:00" title="March 21, 2012  9:17AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, that seems like such a gift - being able to sort of take that guy under your wing and show him some cool stuff you love.

It might be worth considering doing again this year, particularly as we're now drawing twice the crowd we had back then and that I know we're now picking up more first-con-timers if not outright newbie gamers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
