One of the people associated with that early TSR inner circle ( I forget exactly which) had a parent working in some kind of therapy field where "roleplaying" excercises or games were already being used as a technique.<br/><br/>The term got borrowed and stuck.<br/><br/>The reason a term was needed was because the old grogs from the minis wargaming hobby that D&amp;D had sprung from were kinda dicks about this whole new style of play and its swords'n'sorcery themes ( rather than merely historical <i>what-ifs?</i>) and wanted to essentially eject this sort of game and this sort of play from the proper hobby of wargaming.<br/><br/>I'm sure you can draw your own parallels with the current roleplaying hobby and various sorts of not-always-just-one-character-and-divided-traditional-GM-duties-games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359956/#Comment_359956" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-16T07:16:49+00:00" title="February 16, 2012  7:16AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hell, I'd prefer if narrativism was called "premise-addressing", because then it wouldn't make people think it had anything to do with a narrative.

The words aren't exactly the same, but in English, it is common to say that an actor portrayed the <b>role</b> of, say, Claudius in Shakespeare's Hamlet.  That is completely normal usage, and doesn't imply that the actor treated Claudius as something other than a character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360018/#Comment_360018" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-16T12:21:57+00:00" title="February 16, 2012 12:21PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to throw another angle at this:<br/><br/>Have you guys noticed that D&amp;D4e goes out of it's way to specify a definition of "Role" to mean "your area of tactical expertise within the group", specifically, whether you are a Striker, Controller, Leader, or Defender. They use the term with that specific meaning extensively and, it seems, exclusively.<br/><br/>By extension, role-playing in D&amp;D4e would mean: successfully filling your assigned niche during combat.<br/><br/>I find this attempt to subtly redefine the words role and, by extension, roleplaying, to be very very interesting. If I were a conspiracy theorist, I'd be seeing Orwellian newspeak overtones in this action.<br/><br/>I mean, as far as I'm concerned, it fits extremely well with what, in my opinion, D&amp;D has always been - a set of tactical combat rules that, if you really want to, you could use as a framework around which you do some group-based story creation. I think it's kind of neat that, in 4e, the game finally fully embraces what it is actually good at. I see this attempt at redefining the core terms to be part of that effort, though perhaps it is further marginalizing to other games that come under the same blanket terminology.<br/><br/>All the more reason to continue to use the term story games.

Or is it <i>Eggy mud-diving</i>?<br/><br/>Anyway: since this thread is now about football and sports, and such ...<br/>- I love to play football. I have done so since childhood, and at a fairly high level in my youth. But I have become increasingly abhorred by the cheating done on high levels, on broadcast television, in football these last decades. Seems like no sportsmanship is left. Maradona handballs England, with no repercussions. Players take a dive, and get penalties, with cameras showing no foul; and nobody does anything about it. Players admit to cheating, with no repercussions! The players claims they'r not responsible for following the rules; the referee is! And FIFA, the organization that controls it all, don't give a damn about it. Both players and FIFA-bosses seems to be totally cynical about what kind of message this sends to young athletes; cheat and win! Of course they "take it very seriously"; but at the same time they says that there is little to be done; cheating has been, and always will be part of sport ...<br/>- And then; this winter I read an article about cheating in sports, and rugby was held up as a totally different cup altogether; they respect the referee, play fair, and uphold the ideal of real sportsmanship. There is virtually no cheating in the sport. Strange ...<br/><br/>It made me think. <br/>- Why should I care about top-football anymore? It has nothing to do with the sport me and my friends were playing. Even at the age of 8 we played fair. We held that to be important. It was crucial social learning to be berated for taking the ball with your hand; "Do it again, and you're out!" It was NOT ACCEPTABLE! So what kind of childhood did these bosses in FIFA have? Did they not learn the crucial lessons the rest of us got? I know, and most of us do too, that cheating is easy to handle; punish it harshly and make it NOT ACCEPTABLE, like we did in our childhood, and it will stop.<br/>- I expect it will stop by its own accord when people begins to loose interest in the sport. Why should we pay to watch cheating, diving, moaning and cynical "sportsmen" on TV? Why should we pay to advertise our products in connection with foul play? Why pay to see a match where a cheating team wins, in broadcasted daylight? <br/><br/>I see no reason for us lower ourselves to that level. There is so much other stuff on the telly, and so many games to play on the computer. In our backyard too. We may as well take the ball out on the field, and have fun with it; plain, interactive and fair-play fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373346/#Comment_373346" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T02:14:29+00:00" title="April 18, 2012  2:14AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heck, what's with the "playing" part, by the way?

(American) Football was invented because someone playing rugby had the bright idea of allowing a forward pass, which (of course) meant plays had to be reset each down (i.e., because more than half of both teams are WAY behind the line, after a good pass; and those players on defense are "offsides").<br/><br/>Annnnd... the "running with the ball" bit is a myth, apparently:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football</a><br/><br/>But a good one. The factual history is that is was a soccer variant that allowed one to pick up the ball but NOT run forward with it (I presume one would drop kick it to move it forward?). And apparently, there was no team size limit!
