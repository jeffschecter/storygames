                    IPR has made me very happy in the past few weeks with separate deliveries of Contenders, SotC, and today Primitives.  So props to them for their free shipping on large orders and "ship it as it's available" strategy!<br/><br/>But to the game...it's small, it's hand-stitched, it feels really good in the hand.  It seems like the kind of game you would have made in 8th grade when you didn't know what games were <i>supposed </i>to look like, and I mean that in the best possible way.  I absolutely can't wait to read it and play it.<br/><br/>And since the holidays are coming up and my ten year old nephew still has a dinosaur fetish, I'll ask if anyone has played this with younger people or if any of the subject matter would not be suitable for them.<br/><br/>Nice work, Kevin.  Even the paper feels good in my hands.<br/><br/>Chris B.                </div>

                            Thank you so much chris. I'm really happy you like it. "not knowing what a game is supposed to look like," that really warms my heart. <br/><br/>I can't wait to hear about play with kids, as far as i know it hasn't been attempted. Use their little plastic dinosaurs as minis in the play area, it's tons of fun.<br/><br/>again, thank you.                        </div>
