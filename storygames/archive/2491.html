                    I bought <i>Polaris</i> for my friend Josh for Christmas, because he'd expressed interest in it, and because I will leap at any chance to facilitate my own gaming under the guise of being generous to a friend.  Now he thinks we should play it, hurrah!  My evil plan has come to fruition.<br/><br/>In the "Central Authority" thread, people were talking about how some GM-less games like <i>Capes</i> and <i>Universalis</i> seem to have a tendency toward gonzo, over-the-top silliness, at least at first.  Has anyone found this to be the case with <i>Polaris</i>, or does the solemn tone and mechanic work to keep this under control?<br/><br/>I'm sure we'll be sifting through The Forge for good AP threads, but does anyone have any links to ones that they found particularly useful?  Anything we should take into account before we play?  I've read the book, and we're planning on getting the other two players to read at least parts of it before we play, so that should help.                </div>

                            Kirsten,<br/><br/>There was one incident of "over-the-line" silliness when <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=15517.0" rel="nofollow">I played</a>, and that was probably since we were playtesting and I wanted to push the rules a little hard. In general though, there was a lot of comic, whimsical stuff (mostly, manifesting from demons), but it all had a sinister undertone and fit right in with the dark/beautiful vibe. The ritual aspect of the game seemed to help out a lot in this regard, too.<br/><br/>Nothing like <i>Capes</i>, in this regard, at all though. Remember, it's not truly GM-less, there's two co-"GMs" on hand at any given time who can make judgment calls in thorny situations.                        </div>

                            I'd have to go with Per Fischer's advice to me. Go first. Push for something amazing, huge or difficult - killing your turncoat of a lieutenant, framing your wife for a crime, confronting your daughter over a slight and then drawing your sword. Make the player opposite work *hard* to introduce conflict.<br/><br/>I've only played a little Polaris, but didn't find it got silly. There was plenty of humor, but nowt silly. It helps that scenes are chosen very deliberately. You request a scene, play till it sings, then snap the scene shut (and chat about how well it worked).<br/><br/>Very good luck. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Joe.                        </div>

                            Oh goodness gracious me no. Our Polaris game was unremittingly tragic and awful, including my character burning down the library he loved and one of the other knights killing his wife and her lover. I think Polaris was our first stab at a GMless game too, so we didn't do badly!                        </div>

                            Hello Kirsten,<br/>
<br/>
Pretty cool to have such player interest for a game!<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few cents of mine that might help you:<br/>
<br/>
Seth Ben-Ezra did some great APs: check out the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18268.0" rel="nofollow">last one</a> (there's a link to the previous sessions which are a great read as well).<br/>
I also remember Larry's playtest reports as being really cool (they convinced me of the game's awesome niftiness).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>My experience with Polaris silliness</b><br/>
<br/>
In my recent four-session play, things got silly from time to time. But, I had done a poor job of getting the colour across (the other three players just read the "Moments frozen in time" and thought they were abstract).<br/>
Plus, two were long-time players and they had difficulties understanding how the key phrases worked (actually, the greater the experience (in trad games), the more difficulties, it seems). The only "newbie" managed the thing quite well, even catching me off balance with clever use of key phrases (even though I had already played).<br/>
<br/>
All these problems can be overcome by some good communication (or better still: have everybody read the book <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>), setting an example and just playing a session to oil the gears.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Scene framing</b><br/>
<br/>
One thing I will keep in mind (and the understanding of which did enhance our game experience) is that scene framing is very important.<br/>
Fuck dialogues and lengthy introductions.<br/>
Follow Ben's advice in the book and get straight to the point: who is insulting who, with whom is the protagonist's wife screwing, what demon is being slain, what catastrophe is it that is falling on the character, what ignominious accusations are being made, etc.<br/>
And when the climax is done, end the scene. (We often dragged on a bit in the beginning, but it's of no use and it can actually be a source of silliness when the players run out of ideas.)<br/>
<br/>
During the scene, always, always remember to include <b>consequences</b> in your statements. There's no meat in trying to tune down what the other said (except with the use of the <i>You ask far too much</i> key phrase, which is actually a bit different to just tuning down).<br/>
You don't like the consequences that the Mistaken proposes? Either take the risk with <i>It shall not come to pass</i> or hit back with great consequences of your own.<br/>
In-character dialogue which has no consequence should be banned. (A lot of roleplayers like to "act-out" their characters just for the sake of it. Don't do it in Polaris. It slowed down the game for us and led to some absurd scenes as we were flailing around trying to find something to do.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Authority</b><br/>
<br/>
Finally, one should realize that Polaris isn't all that "shared authority" over the course of a given scene. The Moons have hardly any authority (in conflict), and the Heart has only control over his Protagonist (barring the use of conflict phrases). The Mistaken has a lot of it: he controls all rivals, demons and the environment and has nothing to loose.<br/>
And while the key phrases look symmetric in theory, in play the cost to use them is, in the long run at least, greater for the Heart. The Mistaken can always steer things towards an experience roll, which will either reduce the protagonist's Zeal or refresh the themes (allowing renewed use of those powerful key phrases again, bringing the Experience cycle in motion again).<br/>
<br/>
That's were the Mistaken has the upper hand and should, IMO, take advantage (and responsibility) to steer the aesthetics of the game to the group's interests. Of course the story is about the Protagonist, but it's about the Protagonist getting hammered at by lots of things, mainly under the Mistaken's control. If the Mistaken throws silly stuff at the Protagonist, chances are that he will either disconnect from the game and grow passive or address the menace with even more silliness.<br/>
If the Protagonist acts silly, the Mistaken can always claim he is possessed by demons and steer things back a bit.<br/>
That said, the Mistaken hardly has full, classical GM control. But still he has probably got most of it (remember that he has final say over Experience rolls, the game's overarching mechanic.)<br/>
<br/>
One major caveat about this point is scene framing, which lets the framer set the scene with whatever he likes in it. And both the Heart and the Mistaken can do that (so the Mistaken's monopoly of environment, rivals and demons gets mixed into the lot). This goes back to my point about scene framing and basically takes the same idea as before: the scene should be framed aggressively so that it gains impact and pushes for conflict rapidly, letting the authority play flourish to the game's advantage.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is all a bit sketchy and perhaps I've missed a few issues. Hopefully Ben or other more experienced Polaris players can add their comments to the lot.                        </div>

                            Cristoph has good advice.<br><br>Here's my extension on Larry / Per.  If it's the first scene of the game and I'm the Mistaken, and I don't know what else to do, I set it up so that their son or daughter's one true love is a demon.  If it's the first scene and I'm the Heart and don't know what else to do, I kill the senate and declare martial law.<br><br>Polaris can turn silly or not.  There are three things to keep in mind:<br>1) The more invested everyone is in the color, the less likely this are to get silly.<br>2) It's okay to get silly, because that in no way stops you from being tragic.  To look at famous tragedies: Romeo and Juliet is laugh-out loud funny at times.  Even Macbeth has a few yucks.<br>3) The most important thing is the get authority right and play up the moons.  This is the stumbling block I see new players hit a lot.<br><br>yrs--<br>--Ben                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            And remember that the Mistaken's power is very limited (but still very powerful).  In some games I've played, people forget and drift the role to be more like a rotating GM.  The Mistaken isn't supposed to play any NPCs who aren't demons, basically.  They play demons and they can frame scenes (which the Heart can do too).  That's it.  Just demons.  Everyone else is played by a Moon.                        </div>
