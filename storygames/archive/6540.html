Do you actually do anything or is it all just stories?<br/><b>Kynn:</b>: isn't everything all stories? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><b>Kynn:</b>: Good morning! I just woke up.<br/><b>Angela:</b> Yes, but if the game is nothing more than sitting around telling tall tales it seems like it would be a bit boring<br/><b>Kynn:</b>: what would make it less boring?<br/><b>Angela:</b> Doing something. Then telling the stories from what has been done.<br/><b>Kynn:</b>: Well, that's part of the game too. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Just not sure what "doing something" means to you in this context.<br/><b>Angela:</b> Like what is done in the other games we play. GM gives a senerio and the players deal with it.<br/><b>Kynn:</b>: well, the game has a scenario and the players deal with it (and add to it), there's just not a GM<br/><b>Angela:</b> I see.<br/><b>Angela:</b> So then it's just a matter of one uping everyone else? Telling the best story? The biggest story?<br/><b>Kynn:</b>: if your action's just too unbelievable, the person acting as judge gets to shoot it down. didja read the PDF? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> it's 17 pages.<br/><b>Angela:</b> No, I didn't. It doesn't sound like something I'd want to read. Games without a GM tend to be extremely chaotic. I've never seen it work well.<br/><b>Kynn:</b>: okay<br/><b>Angela:</b> There just doesn't seem to be a measure of fairness in the concept. It leaves the door open for hard feelings just cause the judge doesn't like the story being told for whatever reason.<br/><b>Kynn:</b>: what would be more fair?<br/><b>Angela:</b> One judge.<br/><b>Kynn:</b>: why is that more fair?<br/><b>Angela:</b> Same reason it is for games like DnD<br/><b>Kynn:</b>: i mean, it seems to me that the judge could still just not like the story. and because there's only one judge, instead of a judge that changes each time, it exacerbates the unfairness problem<br/><b>Kynn:</b>: is D&amp;D fair?<br/><b>Angela:</b> Nothing is completely fair, but having one judge cuts down on the unfairness factor.<br/><b>Kynn:</b>: i'm not sure i understand why. how does having a single judge cut down on the unfairness factor instead of increasing it?<br/><b>Angela:</b> Do you have a way of over ruling the judge?<br/><b>Kynn:</b>: overruling the judge? nope.<br/><b>Kynn:</b>: but of course since the judgeship moves to a different player next time, you aren't stuck with the same judge. and sometime you'll be that person's judge. so there's an incentive to not be arbitrarily jerky.<br/><b>Angela:</b> No, there isn't. It just makes it so the game degrades into a revenge fest more often. Now if you had a way to over rule the judge like having the other players agree that the story is good. That would be a good way of keeping things more fair and organized.<br/><b>Kynn:</b>: I don't really see it as becoming a revenge fest in the way that you suggest. it sounds to me like you're talking about players deliberately playing the game counter to how it should be played, and that's a problem with nearly any game. in D&amp;D:  "you see orcs coming, what do you do?" "i turn and stab angela's character in the face"<br/><b>Angela:</b> DnD has rules that prevent the game from going too far off course. What does yours have? Trust in the good nature of people? If you rely on that you will be disappointed.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145054/#Comment_145054" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-20T09:42:45+00:00" title="May 20, 2008  9:42AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2008 11:11AM by Kynn.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><b>Kynn:</b>: D&amp;D doesn't have rules that prevent the game from going too far off course, though.

Am I right?<br/><b>Kynn:</b>: you may have played as if there's a rule, and it may be an unspoken social agreement -- i.e. relying on the good nature of people -- but the D&amp;D games don't say that there's an ability for the GM to remove you for violating your alignment.<br/><b>Kynn:</b>: D&amp;D doesn't have that either.<br/><b>Angela:</b> Find me the rule that says it can NOT happen<br/><b>Angela:</b> Go on<br/><b>Kynn:</b>: hold on a sec. you just said that "DnD has rules that prevent the game from going too far off course." i said "no, it doesn't."<br/><b>Angela:</b> Oh, yeah, you are a word twister, I almost forgot.

To me, it's not clear if she just isn't interested in GM-less play, period, or just isn't interested in the style of GM-less play described in this particular game.  There are lots of different kinds of GM-less play out there.  Maybe she won't like any of them, but maybe she might like some of them.

When I first started getting interested in indie/story games, I was worried my two friends who I usually game with would be resistant.  But, while they haven't liked everything we've tried, they've always been willing to give it a shot.  I mean, at worst when you try something new, what do you lose?  A couple hours of your time?  And you could discover something really new and different and fun.  It's very sad when people are that set in their ways they're not even willing to READ the very short rules for a game just because it's different and unusual.<br/><br/>But, I'm not really sure what you can DO about it.

Especially in groups where only one or two people ever GM, and the rest are just players. <br/><br/>If all the players are there one night, but the GM doesn't show up... there's a sense that there's simply no way they can have fun. The GM brings it all with them, you know? If the GM's not there, they might as well pop in a movie or go home.<br/><br/>When problems pop up in the game, likewise, the GM is seen as the one to fix it, since often in those groups it is the GM who wields the final authority--even when another player suggests a solution, the GM "makes it so", saving the game. In fact, in my experience, in a really trad game the players simply do not have the tools at their disposal to handle bad situations and make a bad game into a good one. I'm talking about groups where the social contract is very rigid--good players do not "metagame", speak "out of character", etc--in such a group, when a problem crops up, there is <b>nothing</b> you can do to fix it without breaking those rules and being seen as an even bigger problem.<br/><br/>So, maybe this "friend" of yours is somewhat curious about the game, but shares the common fear that limiting or removing the power of the GM will cause the game to fall off the rails and destory all the group's fun. From a certain angle, she's just poking at this new idea, trying to figure out how it'll get around this worry, and (from the transcript) you didn't do all that much to defuse her fear (which sounds really, really deep).<br/><br/>While I don't think the blame rests on your shoulders here, it does look like you didn't actually say anything about <b>what is fun</b> about your game. (From this limited window into your relationship with Angela, of course, I don't know whether that is true or not.) Arguing about details or worries with skeptics never seems to work as well as just offering them a good time--you always end up arguing about something else instead, something that bugs them (like this whole rules/alignment issue), and end up angry with each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145090/#Comment_145090" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-20T10:42:16+00:00" title="May 20, 2008 10:42AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most frustrating to me is the group where there's been a clear rift between halves -- half your group wants trad play, half your group is ready to try new things, and anything that makes one side happy actively antagonizes the other side.

Doesn't mean she isn't a lousy friend, but basing it off this one conversation that we bear witness to is really unfair.<br/><br/>There are lots of reasons she could be freaking out, and if we knew what they were, her behaviour would make a lot more sense to us. My guess is from having seen these kinds of reactions before, is that she feels attacked. I see it all the time when people discuss music, and it wouldn't surprise me that someone you were playing games with would feel attacked if you said, hey, let's play this other game which to your mind is nothing like the games we've been playing. Because all of a sudden it sounds like my games aren't good enough, that I don't know how to play, that this activity I thought we were both having fun engaging in all of sudden it's only me who has been having fun and I didn't notice you weren't so are you calling me a bad friend?<br/><br/>And on and on and on goes the defensive paranoid mind. And we all have one of those.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145097/#Comment_145097" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-20T11:06:10+00:00" title="May 20, 2008 11:06AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2008 11:06AM by lachek.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (IANAP)<br/><br/>Yeah, so, each and every one of us can see this issue from either side... because however trad or indie aligned we consider ourselves, we've been on the other side of the fence too. We can make arguments pro- or con-Alignments, pro- or con-GM, until we're blue in the face.<br/><br/>That's not what this is about. As Christopher alludes to, this sounds to me like an identity affirmation issue: "What's wrong with the way we've been playing  / what's wrong with me?". Which, frankly, is stupid - who says that about movies? "What's wrong with comedies? Why do you want to watch horror all of a sudden? <i>Why do you hate fun?</i>". Rather, it reminds me of the inane Mac/PC religious wars - someone gets a Mac, and suddenly a bunch of PC users feel threatened. Neither side is capable of saying "well, PCs are good at X, while Macs are pretty good at Y - since you do a lot of X, a PC might be better for you."<br/><br/>Point is, I didn't hear Kynn say "well, AWKA is teh ultimate in RPGs evar, it can do anything!". What I heard was Angela saying "your game can't possibly work because when you play D&amp;D with it, it will fall apart". That's a statement mired in narrow-mindedness, misconceptions and aggressive protection of self-identity. Hearing it said about your <i>own</i> game would be incredibly frustrating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145098/#Comment_145098" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-20T11:08:59+00:00" title="May 20, 2008 11:08AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite><cite>Posted By: Kynn</cite>GM gives a senerio and the players deal with it.</blockquote>\nI have plenty of friends who feel that's what roleplaying games are all about. <br/><br/>An anecdote, for what it's worth:<br/><br/>I had a discussion about some of my ideas with a fellow I used to game with, an intelligent, educated, generally reasonable fellow in his late 30s. He was extremely adamant:<br/><br/>"Any game that does not have a GM and a strong prepared scenario is not an RPG."<br/><br/>To him (and this is almost verbatim), character creation (before the game) and strong prepared adventures were what made RPGs good. Now, I found that pretty ironic, particularly because at least half of the games he ran himself or played in were openly "improvised"--as a GM, he was always ready to run a game on the fly and was very open about the fact that it was improvised. (Often, he would improvise entire sessions from a few rolls on a "worldbuilding" random table.) Those games were, nevertheless, a lot of fun for everybody. <br/><br/>In addition, he was very much a fan of "develop in play", and didn't like detailed character histories or anything like that.<br/><br/>I never managed to get him to explain how he reconciled those two facts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145100/#Comment_145100" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-20T11:14:10+00:00" title="May 20, 2008 11:14AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2008 11:14AM by hoog.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kynn</cite>What have you guys done in similar situations to talk with players who just seem intensely resistant to any non-familiar games which don't centrally feature<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">oppressive tools of the Patriarchy</span>Gamemasters a la D&amp;D?

First of all, if you read her comments, she has tried this play before and it was unsuccessful. She has thought about how to make it successful and the conclusion she drew was "you need a GM" Her arguments may or may not have been flawed, but it was just as early in the morning for her as it was for Kynn.<br/>\n  Second, this is exactly the kind of player you need as a playtester. You want someone who is going to needle and nitpick the rules until there is nothing left to complain about. You want someone who is not afraid to break your game. If she was in my group I would challenge her to break the game and empower her to twist the rules up as far as she could without alienating the other players at the table. How else can you see where the rules enable this kind of behavior and where it is a social contract issue. Its easy to say all of it is social contract, but its more effect to see it broken and then see what can be patched in the rules and what can be chalked up to a bad player, right?<br/>\n  Oh, and I agree, I don't know how you can call each other friends.

When you've got a GM, everyone at the table knows that hey, the GM's going to provide opposition for your characters and is going to be the final arbiter and rules authority when there's a disagreement, and it's not going to be personal -- a traditional GM doesn't really have a horse in that race, after all, which might be where she's getting the "no GM = rampant unfairness/vengeance" thing from.  (Or it might just be that from the PTT writeup it isn't at all clear what, if any, interaction the players or their characters have with each other beyond listening to each other's monologues, and on that level it does kind of sound more like "try and tell a better story than me" and less like a typical roleplaying game.)<br/><br/><br/>This just reminds me why I love the people I play with.  Everyone got on board with the idea of trying out story games, and when it turned out that they were an extraordinarily bad fit for our group, we agreed to stop the experiment with no hard feelings.  We now have a better handle on what kinds of things our group likes and dislikes, and the only hurdle we'd need to jump to try out another story game is to confirm that it doesn't have any of the elements we already know don't work for us.  (Which, it turns out, includes players providing all the adversity for themselves or for each other, and players not having any interaction with each other.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145233/#Comment_145233" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-20T21:15:39+00:00" title="May 20, 2008  9:15PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>And I don't see anything weird or unfriendly about that chat log.</blockquote>\nYou didn't, eh?

If he's left out some part of the gameplay that would've made AWKA something other than the <i>Munchausen</i>-esque game he describes, then reading the PDF might have been useful.  But why should she bother?  If he's describing it accurately (and let's be honest, it's Greg Costikyan, so he probably is), then she obviously can already tell that it's not a game she's interested in, and reading the PDF isn't going to change that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145249/#Comment_145249" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-21T03:21:05+00:00" title="May 21, 2008  3:21AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>I'll throw in a get-a-new-"friend" vote</blockquote>\nSorry David, you're not the only one who pointed this out, and yet I'm quoting you regardless.

I type quickly. Any errors are probably mine.\n<blockquote><br/><b>WORKING WITH PLAYERS</b><br/>Two players want the same magic item. Each thinks his character can use it best or deserves it for what he's done. If the players can't find a way to decide who gets it, you will have to arbitrate or impose a solution. Or, worse, one player is angry with another player for something that happened earlier that day outside the game, so now his character tries to harass or even kill the other player's character. You shouldn't sit back and let this happen. It's up to you to step in and help resolve conflicts such as these. You're a sort of master of ceremonies as well as an umpire during the game. Talk with the arguing players together or separately outside the game session and try to resolve the conflict. Make it clear as nicely as you can that you can't let anyone's arguments ruin the game for the other players and that you won't tolerate real-world hard feelings affecting the way characters within the game react to each other.<br/><br/>If a player gets angry when you rule against her, be firm but kind in telling her that you try your best to be fair and that you can't have angry outbursts spoiling everyone else's fun. Settle the matter outside the game session. Listen to her complaints, but remember that you're the final arbiter, and that by agreeing to play in your game she has also agreed to accept your decisions as DM (see When Bad Things Happen to Good Characters, page 18).<br/><br/>Sometimes one player's actions ruin the fun for everyone. An obnoxious, irresponsible, troublemaking player can make the game really unpleasant. Sometimes he gets other characters killed because of his actions. Other times he stops the game altogether with arguments, tantrums, or off-topic conversations. Still other times he might keep everyone from playing by being late or not showing up at all. Ultimately, you should get rid of this player. Don't invite him next time. Don't play the game with someone you wouldn't enjoy spending time with in another social setting.<br/><br/>If one player dominates the game and monopolizes your time with her character's actions, the other players will quickly grow dissatisfied. Make sure everyone gets his or her turn. Also, make sure each player gets to make his or her own decisions. (Overeager or overbearing players sometimes try to tell the others what to do.) If one player insists on controlling everything, talk to him outside the game session and explain that his actions are making things less fun for everyone.<br/></blockquote>\nSo, does that say that a DM can kick a player out of his game if a player violates her character's alignment? I don't see it. You could interpret violating alignment as being an "obnoxious, irresponsible, troublemaking player," I suppose. In that case, the DMG does advise "ultimately" that you "get rid of this player."<br/><br/>But there are other rules in the game for what happens when a character violates his or alignment, and they're pretty mild. Later on in the DMG, page 134:\n<blockquote><br/>A character can have a change of heart that leads  to the adoption of a different alignment. Alignments aren't commitments, except in specific cases (such as for paladins and clerics). Player characters have free will, and their actions often dictate a change of alignment. Here are two examples of how a change of alignment can be handled.\n<ul><li>A player creates a new character, a rogue named Garrett. The player decides he wants Garrett to be neutral good and writes that on Garrett's character sheet. By the second playing session of Garrett's career, however, it's clear that the player isn't playing Garrett as a good-aligned character at all. Garrett likes to steal minor valuables from others (although not his friends) and does not care about helping people or stopping evil. Garrett is a neutral character, and the player made a mistake when declaring Garrett's alignment because he hadn't yet really decided how he wanted to play him. The DM tells the player to erase "good" on Garrett's character sheet, making his alignment simply "neutral." No big deal.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>I like the "No big deal" part. Certainly not disruptive behavior. Kynn's totally right that the rules don't say that he can't stab you in the face. The rules do suggest that killing party members is disruptive behavior though and such players might be ultimately uninvited. Angela is right there. But she's wrong that it's the alignment rules. <br/><br/>I think the whole Working with Players section is pretty atrocious, though. It has an air of "dealing with the accursed plebes" mentality that I can't stand. I particularly hate the "by agreeing to play in your game she has also agreed to accept your decisions as DM" bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Story games are a hard sell with my friends - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6540/story-games-are-a-hard-sell-with-my-friends/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Story games are a hard sell with my friends - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6540/story-games-are-a-hard-sell-with-my-friends/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="And I just pushed the thread further off the topic.

Don't try to win the argument, because you're just making her more entrenched in her position. She says that she's never seen GMless games work well. Don't make her defend that position. Accept it as fact. It's irrelevant.<br/><br/>Tell her that you think that your game <i>does</i> work well without a GM, or at least you'd like to find out in playtesting, and that you want to playtest it with your group of friends, of which she is a member. Appeal to her emotions, since she doesn't seem to be focusing on the rational stuff right now -- not about this issue.

I have some do's and don't's for dealing with her:<br/>\n1) Apologize - And don't do a half apology where you say I am sorry, but... Obviously her feelings were hurt. And if you don't acknowledge that, you won't make any progress. Also, don't expect an apology back. It will be even niced if she does.<br/>\n2) Don't accuse her of being closed minded. Again, she has tried this sort of game, so in her mind she is open-minded<br/>\n3) Let her know what your goal/agenda is. Read it for grammar, read it to GM it, read it to play it. These all require a different frame of mind and a different skill set.<br/>\n4) If she opens up to you again, share with her the bad experiences you had with GM-less play and how you planned to overcome it. This will show you empathize and that you don't think its a perfect genre/game.<br/>\n5) Let her know that you need her help  with writing/marketing and game designing against this very issue.<br/>\n  The reality is Angela at this point is an avatar of a whole cross-section of gamers. She can help you work out a lot of issues on approach/pitch/buzz/etc. Or, you can accept that you do not want those kinds of people playing your game and leave her alone.<br/>\n  The important thing is, don't assume that your viewpoint is superior. Its like arguing that Mozart is better than the Rolling Stones. Some people will agree, some people will argue, but they will not being doing so based on any objective data. It's a matter of taste...<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145352/#Comment_145352" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-21T13:36:17+00:00" title="May 21, 2008  1:36PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kynn</cite>Hey folks, I'm not asking you to say who is or isn't a friend.<br/><br/>I'm just asking for advice, as some of you have given, on how to deal with players who have the kinds of fears expressed by my friend.

People who've only been exposed to trad RPGs will see the GM as an authority figure and when you continually stressed that there's no GM, Angela seemed to think there's no authority.  But your game has two such figures: the challenge-giver and the judge.  The challenge-giver handles the traditional GM role of creating adversity.  The judge handles the GM role of saying yes or no.  It seems to me you could have better stressed that the authority roles of a GM are still there, just spread out.  And the game gives everyone a chance to try it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule" title="GeekGirlsRule"><img alt="GeekGirlsRule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule">GeekGirlsRule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145371/#Comment_145371" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-21T15:38:30+00:00" title="May 21, 2008  3:38PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2008 3:39PM by GeekGirlsRule.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing here, Kynn, is that some people are just not up for the indie-hippy-black-leotard-wearing-story-games thing, and that's ok.

People can just decide not to play with people. Even if they are friends (you go see a movie with them instead, or drink, or walk in the park, or just chin wag about crap). And that applies to both of you.

And once that happens, all you can do is try to figure out whether the disinterest is due to a misunderstanding (was the impression she got of what the game was about correct?) or because she understands perfectly well what the game is like and simply doesn't care for it.  (If it's a game you wrote, I imagine that this is the point at which you'd want to wrap your personal feelings in fireproof insulation and kick your ego off of the nearest bridge, because there's no point in going any further with the conversation if you can't.)<br/><br/>If it's just a misunderstanding, you can try and correct it by really listening to her objections, reassuring her, and describing why the things she doesn't like aren't actually in the game.  Be friendly and upbeat about it, and keep things on a purely "this is what the game actually is, this is the stuff I think is neat about it, and those things that you were concerned about are thankfully not a part of the game at all" level.  Either she'll buy in to some degree and give it a shot, or she'll tell you "no, still not interested."<br/><br/>If she just doesn't care for it, then you thank her sincerely and back off, because she knows a lot more about what she likes and doesn't like than you ever will.  Remember what her objections were, and if you find or write another story game that doesn't have whatever it was that turned her off to this one, you'll be able to pitch it to her as the story game which <i>doesn't</i> do those things she doesn't like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145389/#Comment_145389" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-21T20:05:25+00:00" title="May 21, 2008  8:05PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2008 8:06PM by noclue.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kynn</cite>b&gt;Kynn:: D&amp;D doesn't have rules that prevent the game from going too far off course, though.

I *knew* I was doing something wrong!<br/><br/>Kynn, I have a really traditionally minded group as well, and I find more and more that the best way to get them play some games I want to try is to provide as little information about the game mechanics as possible before running it.  The more discussion of the mechanics there is up front, the more balking and groaning I have to address in the lead up to the game. Some gamers have pretty deeply embedded preconceptions about mechanics and sometimes the only way to move them past those preconceptions is to experience alternative game styles in play.  Arguing about it before hand just makes things go sour.  So now I just explain a bit of the color and setting of a game and sell it based just on that.  Then I just up and run it, as a one shot at first and with no obligation to continue playing follow on sessions if they don't like it.  While the group has not exactly started wearing black leotards, they have had a lot of fun with the so-called non-traditional games so far, and they have always opted for the follow up sessions.

In those, there's an impartial die-rolling system to determine success and failure; in AWKA, I'd essentially be having to try to impress my Judge with how "awesome" my character is being.  One hard-to-impress person could easily ruin the game, for the player that they're Judge for.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the flip side of things, since the judgement is completely up to the Judge, there could be a social pressure to say "that's awesome!" even to things that aren't really.  (I know... schizophrenic of me.)  If no one's willing to be "the bad guy" and say something isn't awesome, then the game essentially becomes a structured version of round-robin storytelling.  That's not a bad thing in itself, but I can do round-robin storytelling without a system.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe upshot is that it seems to me that Angela might possibly be more open to something like Capes or Universalis, where action resolution is placed on the impartiality of the dice, rather than on a possibly-partial person at the table.  Given her "I'll try to break it to prove that GMless doesn't work" bent that's showing, I'd probably go with Capes, since trying to "mess with" the other players by introducing Goals that they'd want to stop is a necessary part of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to try to show her that GMless play <i>can</i> work, that's what I'd suggest.  I wouldn't hold up high hopes for it, though, with the degree of hostility to the idea she was showing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, another thought -- does she play traditional non-RPG games much?  Monopoly, Parcheesi, Risk, that sort of thing?  If she does, talking about how they manage to work without a GM, through group enforcement of the rules (and group willingness to kick out disruptive players!) might be another tack to take.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145455/#Comment_145455" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T11:06:02+00:00" title="May 22, 2008 11:06AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite>Kynn, what was your motive when you sent her the link?

I figured that might have been your reason, but in reading what you actually posted here, that totally got lost. Like, as soon as she said that sounds boring, why didn't you simply respond with, "maybe, but isn't it freaking cool that my little game got mentioned on Play This Thing?"? Because what actually happened looks like a picture perfect Egri rising conflict conversation that quickly gets out of hand with people saying stuff they probably don't really mean because they've entered into debate mode, and like all humans in debate mode, being right trumps everything else, including being accurate, open, honest, caring, and every other trait we value as human beings. Yes, that's hyperbolic as all get out, but as you can see I've entered into debate mode.<br><br/><img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>But seriously, it reads like your trying to convince her of something, "play this game", and I'm wondering why it doesn't read as, "hey isn't the nod in my direction freaking awesome?" (because, frankly, it was). Now, the answer might be any number of things. Ego. I was tired. The nature of discourse with that person is usually argumentative. Whatever. But, when you're wondering what it is that you can do to end up with a different kind of conversation with people, it's figuring out what that thing is that had you change the nature of the discourse from, "isn't the mention cool?", to "let's debate whether or not my game is any good". Note, I say you, even though obviously you're both involved, it takes two to argue, but the only person you have control over is yourself, so the trick is to figure out why <i>you </i>argued, not why they argued, so you know what to do, or not to do, next time.<br/><br/>Unless of course you want to argue, some people feel that's a reliable way to convince people of things, I don't, but that's my own views on violence speaking.<br/><br/>Oh, and not arguing won't necessarily completely help you in this kind of situation, but it will most likely make it so that worries or concerns the other person has are legitimate ones, and not ones raised simply to win the debate.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145551/#Comment_145551" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T17:34:21+00:00" title="May 22, 2008  5:34PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Past the whole social concern I posted about already, I'm inclined to agree with Travis.<br/><br/>Basically if it's part of the rules people can say a contribution is no good, then it'd be valid for someone else to do that back to them. Back and forth, forever. Even if the reason to do so was petty revenge. And if players should discipline themselves from such emotion, well you don't need a ruleset when you have that level of emotional discipline.<br/><br/>Mind you, I suppose some people don't lean toward thoughts of petty revenge in a board game. But I would think they are a minority. Making it a limited number of people who can play the game functionally.<br/><br/>Petty revenge is fine in a game - I've read plenty of Capes AP where it's in full bloom and even gives the game an extra enjoyable edge. But in this ruleset, from my understanding so far, it'll lead to a death spiral of idea after idea being shot down.

Drifting slightly from a strong-GM game to a slightly-less-strong GM game can backfire. There's a case to be made for all-or-nothing approach. It's risky to take DnD as is and start weakening the GM; you should build a GMless game from the ground up. Someone who has had experience with almost-traditional-but-not-quite games might have bad memories.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. At least speaking for myself, Of the 4 hippy games I've played, and 10 I've read, I only liked one (Polaris). So if I were asked to play a new hippie game... a hippie game in playtesting... and maybe with some rules I find dubious...  I would NOT actually EXPECT to enjoy it. Even though in principal I am attracted to the idea of hippy games, and my favorite game is a hippie game, the short-run expected utility of playing some random new hippy game is indeed negative, and that's based on personal experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. there's also the question of "least common denominator." Traditional games require one very proficient person to GM... and can survive just fine with some "mediocre" players. An actively horrible player can still of course cause problems, but one or two players that are a little slow-witted, or shy, or a little lazy won't break a traditional game. Some hippy games though depend more on everyone being at least reasonably smart, witty, and outgoing. One dull-witted, or even just sleepy, player can really mess up some hippy games. Maybe your player lacks confidence in some of the other players at your table. Possible solution: propose playing a small, private game with only "high quality" people when trying a new hippy game.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. One other technique I use is play the game with as few people as possible first. If we don't like it, scrap it. If we do like it, then the group of us can then go to the fence sitters and say honestly, "we tried it, and it was awesome. You should try it too."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145823/#Comment_145823" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T22:27:12+00:00" title="May 23, 2008 10:27PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mickey, it's a little bit dissapointing that if I mention someone out to destroy you in a game, it's immediately taken as being a butthead.
