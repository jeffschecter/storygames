This will also be my first time PLAYING it too...haha.  Naturally copious amounts of alcohol will be on offer for the toasts that are throughout the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and is there an electronic copy of the story suggestion questions I can print out anywhere?<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally - i did a potted version of the rules which players can scan thru and have included it below - any comments on what I should add?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----<br/>\n<br/>\nBaron Munchausen Summary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSetting<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Year is 1788, You have all been invited to the palace of the Caliph in Persia, a sumptious banquet attended by only the most noble and brave. He wishes to learn more of your exploits and to hear your tales. He has even allowed alcohol into the banquet, as is custom for some of you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour character<br/>\n<br/>\n    *<br/>\n<br/>\n      Think of a name, add an appropriate title if desired. E.g. Baron, Count, Amir, Malik, Archbishop, Pope et al.<br/>\n    *<br/>\n<br/>\n      Add any other information which concerns your character, species or notable attributes - a few sentences. Alternatively decide such things are foolish and write no more.<br/>\n    *<br/>\n<br/>\n      Write your name and title clearly on some paper and place it before you, have a manservant introduce you to the room, with your most impressive accomplisment. Perhaps propose a toast. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTell us Baron, of the story of...<br/>\n<br/>\nSelect a tale at random from the list provided, or decide on your own question for the storyteller.<br/>\n<br/>\ne.g.<br/>\n<br/>\nTell us Cardinal, the story of how you discovered the island of cheese and how you encountered its vile inhabitants?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Dear Countess, Could you Recount again your imprisonment in the Lost City of Atlantis, and how you obtained the ability to summon trout?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is some problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you cannot tell a tale, explain that your throat is dry and propose a TOAST to the room. Ask another lady or gentleman for a story.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nObjections During a story<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may object to the story and add your own idea to the story, paying a coin for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ne.g. But Surely Countess, the great white is so enamoured of the taste of dog that it would have gone for your companion, Toby before you?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCardinal, On my visit to the isle of cheese, I was accosted immediately by a number of french cats who had set up a colony there, how was your encounter with them?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThen...<br/>\n<br/>\nStoryteller may refuse your addition, adding an insult and stating why challenger is mistaken, adding another coin to the pile.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOR<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStoryteller may take the coin(s) and incorporate that detail into their story.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the objector is refused, they can pay another coin, insult the storyteller gravely and so on, with the two parties paying back and forth till one runs out of coins and may concede or take it to DUEL!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember : Insults made have to be accepted and acknowledged to some extent as well as the new story elements.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nProper Decorum<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are all of noble birth and speaking in the court of the Caliph, if we speak of vulgarity, or insult the name of Allah, or merely make the room take a collective gasp of horror, we should be PUNISHED accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEnding the story<br/>\n<br/>\nFive minutes or less is a good time for a story, the host will remind you of this. Once comlete you should state so and Recive a \u201cHuzzah!\u201d from your audience and a TOAST from the room.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you may ask another person who hasnt told a story a question of their exploits.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the stories are done.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce everyone has told their story in turn, your remaining coins are be used on a single vote for your chosen favorite story. It would be unsporting to vote for yourself of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe winner is cheered and must propose a TOAST to the room. <br/>\n<br/>\n---                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220883/#Comment_220883" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T05:00:11+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  5:00AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems like you have it covered.<br/><br/>My wife is the current world champion, and has been for about 10 years. You can divest her of this title, merely by entitling your game the World Championship. I'm sure you could get agreement from Mr Wallis too, if you ask nicely. He might not supply the like of the bottle of Armagnac which Paula won.<br/><br/>There was a slight house rule during the Championship in that a lady could chose a champion to duel for her if required. I performed such a function in the above tournament.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220972/#Comment_220972" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T11:20:42+00:00" title="July 27, 2009 11:20AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            if playing with non-gamers who are prone to losing a sense of self-preservation when intoxicated, hide the knives.<br/><br/>seriously.<br/><br/><br/>...luckily, the trouble was averted.<br/>that would have been the most upsetting actual play i would have ever have had to report.<br/><br/>-jackson                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220980/#Comment_220980" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T12:18:30+00:00" title="July 27, 2009 12:18PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Setting drift.
