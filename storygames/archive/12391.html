I wrote this and thought some of you may enjoy it, i'm interested to hear what you think of the ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>beginning-middle-end, the procedural game.</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI like games that have a clear path of play. Board games, video games, card game, and most successful forms of structured play follow a procedure. However procedure is rare in traditional RPGs. In a procedural game the rules tell you how to start, how to take turns and what choices can be made and what conditions end the game. A procedure is a "Fixed, step-by-step sequence of activities or course of action (with definite start and end points) that must be followed in the same order to correctly perform a task. Repetitive procedures are called routines. See also method." -<a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/procedure.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/procedure.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nProcedure allows a game designer to gauge how long each game will take and understand exactly what players will be concerned with while they play. It's an extremely strong method for designing games, as you can reliably test it and know how it will work in most situations. Procedure helps the designer to define how the game plays. While not explicitly expressed as rules, a traditional rpg is usually played with a procedure in mind (go to tavern, get job, go someplace, kill something. or a social roll, an enviroment roll, and a fight scene). I can only guess as to why these games ignore spelling out procedure as rules, it may be that they dont want to limit player freedom or they want to try and make good on their sales pitch of a universal game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>You did what to the who? the traditional rpg</b><br/>\n<br/>\nTraditional rules are written so they can resolve story points that come up in play. When and how to apply the game mechanics is often at the will of the GM or the insistence of the players.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe traditional RPG without a defined procedure must resolve a story with rules. In my experience this leads to trouble. lets say the combat rules are written for a group of players to fight a group of monsters. What happens if these rules are attempted to handle two armies waring each other? or perhaps a duel between just two characters? often times the rules break in these situations giving far too much or far too little input then the story requiers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you try to resolve a story with rules your going to run into situations where the rules dont work or even exist. Sure a book could try and include rules to resolve every kind of story point that could come up, but who would be so capable as to make it and who could be so devoted as to read it and understand it's use.<br/>\n<br/>\nStory games that dont run into this problem are ones that make the fiction subject to the rules. The rules offer clear choices and clear results, it's then the player's job to weave these results into the story. it can be thought of as a set of rules is resolved by a story. this is the kind of game i am intrested in playing and the kind of games i make.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may come off as sounding like a procedural game only follows a single path or plays the same way every time but this could not be further from the truth. A procedural game has a great opportunity for variance and unique events while still offering a consistent existence each time it's played. For example Settlers of Catan use a set of procedural rules to set up it's game board, these rules result in vastly different distributions of resources for each game played, making settlers a game with great replay value.<br/>\n<br/>\n/end                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278016/#Comment_278016" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-26T08:09:28+00:00" title="June 26, 2010  8:09AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2010 8:10AM by Potemkin.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, could you give us a simple example of how this procedural ...process might work in play? <br><br>I'm imagining - and you must stop me if I'm wrong - a game in which, at the very least, the players are conscious of what 'part' (beginning, middle, end, etc) of the story they are currently telling, their expectations guiding the outcome of narrative-conflict.

For example, my copy of the D&amp;D 4E DM Guide has two sections entitled 'Beginning a Campaign' (p143) and 'Ending a Campaign' (p147) with quite strict advice been given on how to begin and conclude a satisfactory story-arc. While the advise isn't a rule by definition, I feel to break faith with the procedure lain down by the book would rapidly cause the Game-As-We-Know-It to unravel or transform into Something Else. While I understand that your conception of procedure is, perhaps, more structured or exclusive than this, I'll play devil's advocate in defense of tradition for a broader understanding of "rules."<br><br>So, would we call, say, <i>Lady Blackbird</i> procedural? Definite beginning and "rules" for a conclusion, but yet the space in between, while made fruitful by interwoven keys, touches base very little with any real "rules."
