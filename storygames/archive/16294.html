Everyone knows what "hack-n-slash" is, though some people might not define "immersion" but can say if another player was in the zone, or whatever. But when I bring up theory, Idk if I am poor at explaining myself, but it just turns everyone hostile, or as quiet as crickets.<br/><br/>I try to point people to wikipedia or JH Kim's glossary, but every time I do on other forums they either ignore me, or criticize the legitimacy of the work.<br/><br/>I can not do better than Kim, or Edwards, or Tweet. So why do people bash their work? Tweet worked on D&amp;D, Edwards writes games, Kim has a great online resource.<br/><br/>Is there something that GNS/ TBM not cover? I can only think that maybe the lexicon of a bit daunting, but apart from that I think it is a very good model and has been for 20 years or whatever since GDS.<br/><br/>I just want to be able to point to something, and ask where does your play-style or game fit within this taxonomy.<br/><br/>I might be asking how to make a horse lead to water, drink. But it is just frustrating that it seems that most people I find cant deal with the established model.<br/><br/>My example: The only person (RPGPundit of all people) I found in the last couple months that even agreed with TBM,  called it "subversive" and "swine indoctrination" used to destroy traditional gaming. Ffs Tweet worked for WotC and D&amp;D. I seriously have been bashing my head against the wall trying to find a way to communicate about gaming in a shared language. HaveI just been surrounded by trolls, because this is what IRL is like for me too.<br/><br/>Everyone wants to talk about the cool magic sword, or their Blackleaf elf. How do I talk about play concepts rather than play experience? How do I find a language that other people will agree on?<br/><br/>For example "story games" means traditional RPGs according to this site. But seems to have a connotation elsewhere. Does anyone else find things missing from the standard lexicon, or do I just need to be communicating with different people?<br/><br/>*awkardturtle*<br/><img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371955/#Comment_371955" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T13:27:51+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  1:27PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

I read Edwards and Kims glossaries, and this week was rereading some Gygax writing on Roleplay Mastery.<br/><br/>Im not trying to be evangelical or anything, in fact I am personally critical of some aspects of even the most coherent models. But it seems like with the people I have been talking to recently, that I am a sock-puppet and fan-boy or something.<br/><br/>I just want to find a way to talk about it, and for two reasons get a better understanding of my own work, and how others identify and categorize it.<br/><br/>And secondly just to put it right in my own terms.<br/><br/>Like if someone could come up with a better model they would right? Cause I could not, and therefor find the main ones hard to dismiss.<br/><br/>Color Theory sorry I find confusing, it seems if it was written by someone with synesthesia; Turku School is just plain offensive, and 0% valid as a taxonomy. The Gygax model is queer and makes no clear definition other than talking about gognards and munchkins.<br/><br/>Yet GDS has been updated to GNS/ TBM, and it seems very good at defining what are the RP characteristics; Is this the best we are going to have for the next 10 years of RP discussion?<br/><br/>Maybe I just need more familiarity myself with what is the convention and am just talking aloud.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371964/#Comment_371964" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T14:08:26+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  2:08PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to write a longer response, but I wanted to ask in general, what's TBM?

(It's not sole causation, either, but it's not coincidence.)

For GNS, it got a lot of exposure through an evangelical approach, and argumentative. I was a part of the problem (although a small part, I hope) as I found it really helpful and would try to explain to others how it was Right\u2122.<br/><br/>Part of the problem of trying to be right was making those general categories harder definitions. A game with mostly Gamist elements had to be Gamist. A player who played it was also Gamist.  That wasn't the intention of the theory, but the cat was out of the bag and a lot of people encountered it with someone telling them that either their game was broken or damaged because it didn't have a clear premise, or having their favorite game or themselves given a label (with Gamist probably being the most common, something that was often painted as the most unfavorable of the three)<br/><br/>The problem is on both sides.  Is there something not covered by GNS? Yes! Probably every game!  I've played "broken" games with focused simulation or narrative. I've played narrative oriented games (intentionally, forge style even) where I do very little except min max and try to get the best results - a gamist attitude.  Categories and theories are an attempt to define reality. They aren't reality. Even in the scientific sense, theories are the best picture of what we know to be true. But there are gaps and nothing is every "proven" completely.<br/><br/>Also, the dominance of the theory colors future discovery. Is it the best? Doubtful, but it's not bad either.  It can certainly be improved and refined. But what other ways are there to theorize about gaming that are completely different? Maybe, but it's hard to look at games and think of theory and also not let GNS influence me. Even taking something like Magic's Timmy, Johnny, Spike player archetypes and that's not far off from a GNS basis.<br/><br/>And then there's the fact that some people don't like theory. The abstract and/or objective look at things is either not interesting, not fun, or not helpful. It's easy to self-justify by making value judgements ("Well, some people aren't smart enough, I guess") but that doesn't add to the dialog. The truth is people have different goals with games, and different perspectives on life, and sometimes that means trying to avoid categorizing and defining everything they do. Critical analysis is something that people who like a huge variety tend to do. It could be a coping mechanisms for people with a hunger for new things and new experiences. <br/><br/>Like I said, I can't answer for you, and I know I can't answer for a collective. But I can do more than ask you your own questions in return .Let me answer your questions from my perspective and see if that helps.<br/><br/>I define games because it helps me look at them objectively, and helps me understand what they might be like to play. I am not satisfied with just a handful of games. I love playing new games, and love the thrill of maybe finding a new favorite game.  Theory helps me do this. Also theory helps me investigate my own style of play.<br/><br/>I define RPGs based on a rough GNS model. I'm not happy with the model. Each category has a problem with it, and when applied to games, they seem to address different things. In other words, I can imagine having a game that is Gamist, where the mechanics focus on creating story (now!), and simulates a fiction in a way to allow players to fully explore. It could be I misunderstand the theory. But these are still valuable as objectives for play. In fact, I like games that have the potential for all three of those.  I find more fruitful is having designers who are aware of the possibility of theory, and even if they dislike all the current ones, it still can prompt designers to think about the intentions of their design.<br/><br/>I use english words when talking about theory. Unless GNS is part of the topic already, bringing it in is too much of a potential powder keg. Or rather, I don't tend to talk about theory. I try to focus on experiences instead. If someone is having a problem with a game, it doesn't matter if we can define one of the players as Gamist and another as Narrativist or not. They aren't going to fit the archetypes anyway. I focus on the experiences at hand, and then learn from that. I reflect upon that. Sometimes I see patterns and connections, and those help me build a picture of game theory, as it were. But when I need to communicate that, I go back to experiences and English. I might be able to write up essays to establish theory and lexicon, but then people would need to know my essays to understand my new lexicon.  But by focusing on my experiences, I think I get theory across without alienating as many people, and the dialogs themselves can result in a lexicon that is more natural and easier to understand as a result.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371981/#Comment_371981" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T14:51:16+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  2:51PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>We define roleplaying because separating form from content frees you from cultural bondage.

I know the word "jargon" is a loaded term these days, and I mean it a couple senses: both the "way of talking meant to confuse someone" and the "powerful technical term meant to convey meaning in a condensed form" senses. People seem to rail against the idea that game design theory overloads the meaning of a lot of everyday words. I don't consider that a terrible problem. If you want to talk about game design, which is a hard subject, then you have to learn some special terminology, which is kinda expected for when you're learning something hard. I'm not saying that game design is brain surgery, but when you learn to play football, there are new terms that overload everyday meanings of words.<br/><br/>The thing about TBM is that is (mostly) focuses on observed, actual play. A lot of people assume it does more than that, and that's where most of the big problems start. Creative Agenda doesn't try to categorize players or individual play preferences or what's going on in a single person's head. It's an observed phenomenon about a group property, generally after the fact, based on observations of hours of play (one "instance" of play that touches on the entire reward cycle a least once). Sure, you can have theoretical discussions about CA in theoretical play, but if you follow Ron Edwards on The Forge for a while, you'll see he avoids that and will jump at people to provide descriptions of real people playing real games. The man is a behavioral scientist, and that's how he rolls.<br/><br/>The biggest issue with Forge jargon is that it changes and it isn't really defined anywhere central. The Forge Glossary is the best start, but even it is outdated. It's more like the statute law that gets overridden by case law, but replace "court cases" with "forum discussions." If you don't follow the forums or disappear for a while, meaning can change and then you're lost because you mean 2001-Simulationism and everyone else means 2012-Simulationism. [Mind you, I don't think the definition of Simulationism has changed significantly in the last decade, but it's been explained better using examples or re-castings like "constructive denial" (another jargon term).]<br/><br/>Remember that Forge Theory came about as a way to diagnose actual play and fix some problems people were having in real games. It wasn't exactly a design tool. That is, it wasn't for designing games in a vacuum. It was for looking at games that weren't working for some people, at least not consistently, and changing them or making new games or just playing the game differently so that people could have consistently fun play experiences. <br/><br/><br/>To address your specific questions:<br/><br/><b>Why do we define games?</b><br/><br/>I'm not sure who "we" are. The Forge? I'm not sure we define games at all. We have a large-scale model--not a definition--of an instance of play for a role-playing game: The Big Model, with its layers of Social Contract - Exploration - Techniques - Ephemera... and Creative Agenda <br/> spiking through all four layers. Lots of people have attempted defining "RPG," including myself. <br/><br/>There's a lot of disagreement about these definitions, but I'm not sure a good definition really matters that much. I used to argue that being able to design an RPG requires that one knows what an RPG is. I'm not sure it's that important anymore. If you design something that isn't an RPG, but it's similar and still fun and people will play it, who cares? Definitions can be limiting. Sticking to definitions could have stopped games like Everway, Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple, Happy Birthday Robot, or Montsegur 1244 from seeing the light of day.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>How do we define RP design?</b><br/><br/>Again, why does it matter? It's that process we go through when we make a new RPG. Do we need to know anything more?<br/><br/>We can wax philosophical about what "design" means in any context, and maybe that will inform us about aesthetics and elegance and such, and perhaps that can make us better designers.<br/><br/><br/><b>What can I use to describe RP theory and lexicon?</b><br/><br/>Anything you want. Jargon is a language shortcut. Instead of saying "a shared priority about how to measure the value of player input among everyone at the table, so that everyone is on the same page and is pushing the game in the same direction instead of working against one another at worst, or taking turns getting what one wants at best," we say "Creative Agenda." Do people get confused about what Creative Agenda is, maybe because the word "agenda" suggests a single player's personal preference? Sure. All the time. But I think that's an issue with jargon in all fields.<br/><br/>If you want to start new discussions about RPG theory on your own blog or whatever, just define your terms and start from scratch. You don't have to use Forge terms, and you probably shouldn't unless you really, really understand them. Also, don't try to have these discussions on TheRpgSite, because my impression is that a lot of the more vocal regulars there feel that there isn't a lot needed for RPG design and that it's all up to the GM anyway (that is, System Doesn't Matter), and look down on the entire idea of design. If you want to talk about RPG design on other forums, talk about it in terms of your own actual play and what worked and what didn't work. You don't need jargon for that.<br/><br/>If you are looking to expand upon the field of RPG design theory, then pick a model and learn it well, use it to analyze your own actual play, and write some games and analyze your own playtests using the model.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371985/#Comment_371985" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T15:07:01+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  3:07PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Snake_Eyes</cite>Well how does it get added to rather than deconstructed?<br/><br/>I think mostly it is a good model, just maybe could be presented differently.<br/><br/>Definitely TBM needs some additional work, as does JH Kim's glossary.<br/><br/>But saying that, I think they have done marvelous jobs, and personally I could not do even a poor imitation.

I think Chris Chinn and Joshua AC Newman and Nathan Paoletta had started some "Big Model in my own words" projects. <br/><br/>How do you add to it? Well, the general feeling is that all the exciting work to be done on it is in the Techniques layer. Vincent has done some amazing work by writing games that are damned-well-founded in Big Model theory, or at least Vincent's flavor of it. He gets the theory about as well as anyone else. Check out his games for exciting understanding of IIEE, for example. Want to add to theory yourself? Design a game that opens up our understanding of some part of the Big Model. Again, that will most likely happen in the Techniques layer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371990/#Comment_371990" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T15:21:13+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  3:21PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2012 3:22PM by Moreno R..">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Victorian, to be able to use a language for communication, you have to SHARE a language with your interlocutor.<br/><br/>Forge theory is not widely known, and what is known is 99% of the times not what the theory really says, but what somebody misunderstood years ago and posted hundreds of times everywhere, smothering any real use of that terminology to communicate with anybody that you are not really sure is using these words with the same meaning you do.<br/><br/>So, outside the Forge and very few other places, Forge Jargon is used almost exclusively to confuse communication, to appear more knowledgeable, or to pass as an "insider".<br/><br/>It's not a failure of the language, is a failure of the forums social culture, but the end result is the same: don't ever use Forge Jargon without first be sure that you are talking with someone who will not misunderstand what you mean.  Even better, don't use it at all, just to be sure. Talk using real play examples.<br/><br/>This is even mandatory at the Forge.  And it's a really good rule (we copied it for our own Italian forum). Talking in actual play terms give you credibility from the beginning, it says that you play (it's not a given in rpg forums), that you think about your playing, and you want to talk about it.  When you talk using forge jargon, people don't know if you are really trying to communicate or you are showing off or posturing.or trying to confuse the discussion. <br/><br/>As an example: just a few hours ago I compiled a list of the best actual play threads to learn forge theory (and GNS in particular). You can find it here: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=32931.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=32931.0</a><br/><br/>They are a good example of how the use of actual play examples simplify the communication and understanding of the theory.<br/><br/>And about most of the people who play rpgs... they simply don't care. And they are right not to care. They want to play, not to learn some theory and a new language.  Do you want to have a car engineer and a mechanic on the backseats of your car explaining to you how the car was built and how it works, every time you take the car to go to the store? If a game works, you don't need to learn any theory to play it. You need some knowledge of how the damn thing works only if it doesn't really works and you have to fix it by yourself (this last part describe my first twenty years in traditional role-playing by the way...)<br/><br/>Don't try to force people to be interested in things that they are not interested about.  Play good rpgs with them instead. This is the best way to help people understand better what rpgs can do.<br/><br/>[edit: crossposted with SIX other posts: I type too slowly in English...  :.-(  ]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371992/#Comment_371992" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T15:28:32+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  3:28PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>The Big Model is most certainly not the last, best word - I think everyone who's inclined to do theory is just thoroughly tired of arguing on the Internet right now.

People whom I wouldn't normal roleplay with, and<br/>\n2. Make my understanding, if the only hobby I have kept over my lifetime, more complete. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a roleplayer, like in the Military you have areas of cultural divide, You generate terms and language to allow you know who's part of your tribe. There are area's that join everyone together like terms like Twink, Munchkin, etc. But there are also terms that divide those sub-cultures as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nMilitary still beat up on Military, best example I can give is Navy and Army bars, you don't go in one if your the other and not expect a fight. Same with the sub-cultures of roleplayers, though it's more of a war of words.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have terms "Dice and Numbers" which I use for D&amp;D players whom play the game based on their knowledge of the game and get happy about the stats, the items as a game mechanic. Min-Maxers is another term I use. This kind of labeling puts me squarely in sub-culture of Roleplaying.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook even though I am a roleplayer and I am part of a community that extends round the globe, I don't play in many of the sub-cultures because either I don't like them, and in some cases would like to lay down and avoid them. Also some people, don't like being designated a type of roleplayer, and some of our labels can be down right offensive in the way we use them. Roleplaying is a personal thing, you get attached to your characters and the stories that come with them, so of course it's a touchy area to talk about. <br/>\n<br/>\nI could blather on for ages about this subject it's one area I am interested in because I do like labels, I could stick labels on roleplayers all day. Just give me a dymo and enough tape and we could all be covered.  I have always thought this kind of thing would make for a great way to fine like minded roleplayers in your local area, and even help you grow as a roleplayer as long as it was used correctly. It's also an invasion of privacy...well I feel it can be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I am stopping now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371995/#Comment_371995" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T15:32:31+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  3:32PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jogesh EZ</cite><cite>Posted By: Snake_Eyes</cite>Well then why do some people *not* define it, or make up there own terminology and lexicon?</blockquote>\nThis happens when people don't find the answers that makes sense for them.  For GNS, it got a lot of exposure through an evangelical approach, and argumentative. I was a part of the problem (although a small part, I hope) as I found it really helpful and would try to explain to others how it was Right\u2122.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Well it seems to be the best we have, and honestly my criticisms against them are not the norm. As I said before I prolly look like an evangelist fan-boy, so sorry to anyone I quote without knowing them personally.<br/><br/>Part of the problem of trying to be right was making those general categories harder definitions. A game with mostly Gamist elements had to be Gamist. A player who played it was also Gamist.  That wasn't the intention of the theory, but the cat was out of the bag and a lot of people encountered it with someone telling them that either their game was broken or damaged because it didn't have a clear premise, or having their favorite game or themselves given a label (with Gamist probably being the most common, something that was often painted as the most unfavorable of the three)<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Something simple like the MMORPG for elements of players having percentages assigned to each element, and then given a clear fundamental aspect. Maybe try to include a Richard A Bartle approach where a game could be 60% game 30% story 75% simulation,  to created an overall Simulationist game?<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;The names have bad connotations, gamist is good I like games where there is some meta-gaming and social interaction. Anything even remotely "gamey" about RP makes me exited, but then I like clever rules and playing to occupy time.<br/><br/>The problem is on both sides.  Is there something not covered by GNS? Yes! Probably every game!  I've played "broken" games with focused simulation or narrative. I've played narrative oriented games (intentionally, forge style even) where I do very little except min max and try to get the best results - a gamist attitude.  Categories and theories are an attempt to define reality. They aren't reality. Even in the scientific sense, theories are the best picture of what we know to be true. But there are gaps and nothing is every "proven" completely.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;One of the big problems what happens when I "drift". I used to call my games "dice-less" but i just played differently to other people. What happens when something simple like D&amp;D using a karma resolution? What happens when it gets driven by abstract fortune mechanics? And a calvin-ball narrative contest?<br/><br/>Also, the dominance of the theory colors future discovery. Is it the best? Doubtful, but it's not bad either.  It can certainly be improved and refined. But what other ways are there to theorize about gaming that are completely different? Maybe, but it's hard to look at games and think of theory and also not let GNS influence me. Even taking something like Magic's Timmy, Johnny, Spike player archetypes and that's not far off from a GNS basis.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Well I think it is better than going backwards in time, to Tweet and Kim with a much simpler theory. Gygaxian theory as the convention would kill me, as much as I love the man.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I saw GDS as "Gamism"= Social/ Play, "Narrative"= Creation/ Story, "Simulation" Game/ Machinations. However you want to call it most people are happy with three sections rather than a Game &gt; Narrative axis and "simulationism" as an independent axis. GDS/ GNS and TBM names are fine categories, but agree they need better names.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Tbh I love the theory, but it has not been revised AFAIK since 2005?! Time for a revamp at the least, a new dress perhaps?<br/><br/>And then there's the fact that some people don't like theory. The abstract and/or objective look at things is either not interesting, not fun, or not helpful. It's easy to self-justify by making value judgements ("Well, some people aren't smart enough, I guess") but that doesn't add to the dialog. The truth is people have different goals with games, and different perspectives on life, and sometimes that means trying to avoid categorizing and defining everything they do. Critical analysis is something that people who like a huge variety tend to do. It could be a coping mechanisms for people with a hunger for new things and new experiences.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I think you said it before, it helps with ideas.<br/><br/>Like I said, I can't answer for you, and I know I can't answer for a collective. But I can do more than ask you your own questions in return .Let me answer your questions from my perspective and see if that helps.<br/><br/>I define games because it helps me look at them objectively, and helps me understand what they might be like to play. I am not satisfied with just a handful of games. I love playing new games, and love the thrill of maybe finding a new favorite game.  Theory helps me do this. Also theory helps me investigate my own style of play.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Cool.<br/><br/>I define RPGs based on a rough GNS model. I'm not happy with the model. Each category has a problem with it, and when applied to games, they seem to address different things. In other words, I can imagine having a game that is Gamist, where the mechanics focus on creating story (now!), and simulates a fiction in a way to allow players to fully explore. It could be I misunderstand the theory. But these are still valuable as objectives for play. In fact, I like games that have the potential for all three of those.  I find more fruitful is having designers who are aware of the possibility of theory, and even if they dislike all the current ones, it still can prompt designers to think about the intentions of their design.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Sounds like what D&amp;D 4E tried to do. It just needed a chapter on drifting. I am strongly of the belief that there are a few examples of El Dorado, just that as a RP there is always something better. For example I know a lot of people that were happy with GURPS for decades of play and hundreds of games. Does not mean that they are not going to invent a new story telling concept. Or a new dice for added simulation. Personally I played a Karma-Narrative D&amp;D campaign for over a decade, and I rolled only a handful of dice for combat in those ten years.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Right do exceptions that prove the rule, actually disprove the rule? Or are they mislabeled and misused?<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I agree on your stance of the merits of RP theory. If I did not get something out of this I would not be actively seeking and understanding and discussion.<br/><br/>I use english words when talking about theory. Unless GNS is part of the topic already, bringing it in is too much of a potential powder keg. Or rather, I don't tend to talk about theory. I try to focus on experiences instead. If someone is having a problem with a game, it doesn't matter if we can define one of the players as Gamist and another as Narrativist or not. They aren't going to fit the archetypes anyway. I focus on the experiences at hand, and then learn from that. I reflect upon that. Sometimes I see patterns and connections, and those help me build a picture of game theory, as it were. But when I need to communicate that, I go back to experiences and English. I might be able to write up essays to establish theory and lexicon, but then people would need to know my essays to understand my new lexicon.  But by focusing on my experiences, I think I get theory across without alienating as many people, and the dialogs themselves can result in a lexicon that is more natural and easier to understand as a result.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I would love to see a new glossary written, I cant do it Im dyslexic with severe cognitive disabilities. But a English-friendly version of GNS would be awesome. I think that is the biggest hurdle for it atm.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;What about if I tried asking around the forums for people to help rewrite GNS into a natural-language taxonomy? Is this too much over my head?

I know the word "jargon" is a loaded term these days, and I mean it a couple senses: both the "way of talking meant to confuse someone" and the "powerful technical term meant to convey meaning in a condensed form" senses. People seem to rail against the idea that game design theory overloads the meaning of a lot of everyday words. I don't consider that a terrible problem. If you want to talk about game design, which is a hard subject, then you have to learn some special terminology, which is kinda expected for when you're learning something hard. I'm not saying that game design is brain surgery, but when you learn to play football, there are new terms that overload everyday meanings of words.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I find it confusing the jargon, and when I try to learn new words by using them, I get them out of context and am not corrected just dismissed.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Everyone says use natural language right? Then why dont we have a natural language lexicon and taxonomy?<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Sure examples are good, but I need to know how to ask questions, and tell people what kind of answers I want.<br/><br/>The thing about TBM is that is (mostly) focuses on observed, actual play. A lot of people assume it does more than that, and that's where most of the big problems start. Creative Agenda doesn't try to categorize players or individual play preferences or what's going on in a single person's head. It's an observed phenomenon about a group property, generally after the fact, based on observations of hours of play (one "instance" of play that touches on the entire reward cycle a least once). Sure, you can have theoretical discussions about CA in theoretical play, but if you follow Ron Edwards on The Forge for a while, you'll see he avoids that and will jump at people to provide descriptions of real people playing real games. The man is a behavioral scientist, and that's how he rolls.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Is that what he teaches? Makes sense then.<br/><br/>The biggest issue with Forge jargon is that it changes and it isn't really defined anywhere central. The Forge Glossary is the best start, but even it is outdated. It's more like the statute law that gets overridden by case law, but replace "court cases" with "forum discussions." If you don't follow the forums or disappear for a while, meaning can change and then you're lost because you mean 2001-Simulationism and everyone else means 2012-Simulationism. [Mind you, I don't think the definition of Simulationism has changed significantly in the last decade, but it's been explained better using examples or re-castings like "constructive denial" (another jargon term).]<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;It does not seem to be touched since 2005. And expects a lot from the reader. The wikipedia entries on RP Theory are great, I would love to see someone from The Forge update them, and add a little to them.<br/><br/>Remember that Forge Theory came about as a way to diagnose actual play and fix some problems people were having in real games. It wasn't exactly a design tool. That is, it wasn't for designing games in a vacuum. It was for looking at games that weren't working for some people, at least not consistently, and changing them or making new games or just playing the game differently so that people could have consistently fun play experiences.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;It might seem like I want to find a way to include "social contract" or "immersion" in game design, Idk. I figure if you can define it and qualify it you can prolly quantify it and therefor manipulate it through inherent game design.<br/>To address your specific questions:<br/><br/><b>Why do we define games?</b><br/><br/>I'm not sure who "we" are. The Forge? I'm not sure we define games at all. We have a large-scale model--not a definition--of an instance of play for a role-playing game: The Big Model, with its layers of Social Contract - Exploration - Techniques - Ephemera... and Creative Agenda<br/>spiking through all four layers. Lots of people have attempted defining "RPG," including myself.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;You, but if you are happy speaking for anyone else or your play-group feel free.<br/><br/>There's a lot of disagreement about these definitions, but I'm not sure a good definition really matters that much. I used to argue that being able to design an RPG requires that one knows what an RPG is. I'm not sure it's that important anymore. If you design something that isn't an RPG, but it's similar and still fun and people will play it, who cares? Definitions can be limiting. Sticking to definitions could have stopped games like Everway, Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple, Happy Birthday Robot, or Montsegur 1244 from seeing the light of day.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Right, some people are blessed with the ability to grok TBM. I still dont understand all of it, because I used my own lexicon for such a long time. So thanks everyone for help.<br/><br/><b>How do we define RP design?</b><br/><br/>Again, why does it matter? It's that process we go through when we make a new RPG. Do we need to know anything more?<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Well  so we can talk about it.<br/><br/>We can wax philosophical about what "design" means in any context, and maybe that will inform us about aesthetics and elegance and such, and perhaps that can make us better designers.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I think that it helps, say if I notice that there are a lot of different Fortune resolution mechanics, but found new ones, it helps if we can talk using a common language. This might not mean much to someone that can speak or write well, but I find with specific concepts means that actual new material gets born. Something like the 36 plots of dramatic action, help define the basic story of so many RPG experiences. When we have a good understanding of Mythology, we find similarity in stories. A good language helps poor communicators understand and convey ideas more easily. We are limited by our tools.<br/><br/><b>What can I use to describe RP theory and lexicon?</b><br/><br/>Anything you want. Jargon is a language shortcut. Instead of saying "a shared priority about how to measure the value of player input among everyone at the table, so that everyone is on the same page and is pushing the game in the same direction instead of working against one another at worst, or taking turns getting what one wants at best," we say "Creative Agenda." Do people get confused about what Creative Agenda is, maybe because the word "agenda" suggests a single player's personal preference? Sure. All the time. But I think that's an issue with jargon in all fields.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;See that is what I mean, when we both are on the same page, we can skip over the explanation, and ask the question we want to ask.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;If I get confused I just like help.<br/><br/>If you want to start new discussions about RPG theory on your own blog or whatever, just define your terms and start from scratch. You don't have to use Forge terms, and you probably shouldn't unless you really, really understand them. Also, don't try to have these discussions on TheRpgSite, because my impression is that a lot of the more vocal regulars there feel that there isn't a lot needed for RPG design and that it's all up to the GM anyway (that is, System Doesn't Matter), and look down on the entire idea of design. If you want to talk about RPG design on other forums, talk about it in terms of your own actual play and what worked and what didn't work. You don't need jargon for that.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I do not have a blog, I just visit forums.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I hate to bash anyone, but yeah I have gotten some great advice by a few people, but poor discussion regarding Dev and Des.<br/><br/>If you are looking to expand upon the field of RPG design theory, then pick a model and learn it well, use it to analyze your own actual play, and write some games and analyze your own playtests using the model.</blockquote>\n&gt;&gt;I love GNS/ TBM, I just wish it had a natural language, and got the occasional revamp.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I am pretty much 90% fluent in GNS TBM. But terms like Bang! and Flag, which might be common jargon seem foreign to me.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I dont think I could add anything to the theory, that is the problem. I just see a few things which could be better, I dont mean to sound egocentric or whatever, I fully respect everyone that has made a valuable model, Kim; Tweet; Edwards; I think they are all great and they have basically used the same model for 20 years. So I think the only thing I can do is maybe say what a great job they have done. And offer some suggestions.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;It would be nice to have a thread where people could tap into a common collective, because I would think  that if 1/100 suggestions was overall positive that some changes could make the tenets clearer and stronger. And therefor help design by spotting weakness and opportunity for growth.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and comments Adam Dray,<br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372004/#Comment_372004" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T16:26:52+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  4:26PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite><cite>Posted By: Snake_Eyes</cite>Well how does it get added to rather than deconstructed?<br/><br/>I think mostly it is a good model, just maybe could be presented differently.<br/><br/>Definitely TBM needs some additional work, as does JH Kim's glossary.<br/><br/>But saying that, I think they have done marvelous jobs, and personally I could not do even a poor imitation.

I think Chris Chinn and Joshua AC Newman and Nathan Paoletta had started some "Big Model in my own words" projects.<br/><br/>How do you add to it? Well, the general feeling is that all the exciting work to be done on it is in the Techniques layer. Vincent has done some amazing work by writing games that are damned-well-founded in Big Model theory, or at least Vincent's flavor of it. He gets the theory about as well as anyone else. Check out his games for exciting understanding of IIEE, for example. Want to add to theory yourself? Design a game that opens up our understanding of some part of the Big Model. Again, that will most likely happen in the Techniques layer.<br/><br/>I will google them, thanks for some suggestions.<br/><br/>Seems I might need to buy one of V Bakers books after all, they sound really interesting.<br/><br/>Right, that makes a lot of sense to me, it is funny because I think of a lot of story games as centered around alternative social contracts, rather than techniques. What I mean (so I dont get the terms wrong) is sure we make new dice, and mechanisms to make games, indie games make use of elements of techniques by having players use narrative differently. But people also can make game that play differently just by entering into social contracts. The game for the DM is different to the PCs but they are at the same table. Entering into a social agreement where we can cheat and lie or other diplomacy engagement creates a different game to one which you must gather allies and cooperate against a common force.<br/><br/>Even something simple with techniques, such as playing D&amp;D with a calculator or replacing a d20 with story dice, or writers dice. These change the game. But I am sure that there are examples for each part of TBM that there is a RPG out that works against the grain,  and produces a unique experience to playing.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372008/#Comment_372008" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T17:09:31+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  5:09PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I first came across the Big Model, it helped. It got me thinking about what other people were looking for in play compared to what I was looking for.<br/><br/>I think the best thing that comes from defining Creative Agenda is that it validates other people and how they play. They're not doing it wrong, they're doing it different.<br/><br/>And, for that, it's a great start.<br/><br/>But I don't see the model doing much more than that. And how could it, with only 3 categories?<br/><br/>I mean, can I define an American's entire political belief structure just by identifying them as Republican, Democrat, or Green party (or pick another 3rd party, or even group all of them, whatever). Of course not. Putting you into one level of categorization based on a tripartate grouping tells me only a little bit about that person and how they feel about any one given issue.<br/><br/>I usually focus more on larp rather than tabletop roleplaying. So when I looked at theoretical models, I focused on that, and came up with an article called Analyzing Player Motives to Inform LARP Design, which is here: <a href="http://www.mortalisrpg.com/?download=5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mortalisrpg.com/?download=5</a><br/><br/>In that article, I identified 16 player motives. Motives are multiple things. They are desires that drive decisions, which are revealed in specific, tangible behaviors. And they are the urge to have certain types of interactions - the desire to have to opportunity to make the decisions and exhibit the behaviors.<br/><br/>I think that by breaking things down into much smaller, more specific pieces, motives become something much more actionable than creative agendas are. You can use them as a designer to make specific decisions about what you put into your game.<br/><br/>You might find something like that more tangible and easier to talk about with people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372013/#Comment_372013" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T17:41:11+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  5:41PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>But I don't see the model doing much more than that.

Sure some people use their own lexicon and taxonomy, but hopefully as RP ages it will be developed into a form where it is not "Jargon" but just a standardized leicon and form of communication.<br/><br/>It's not a failure of the language, is a failure of the forums social culture, but the end result is the same: don't ever use Forge Jargon without first be sure that you are talking with someone who will not misunderstand what you mean.  Even better, don't use it at all, just to be sure. Talk using real play examples.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I have misused personally a lot of RP theory terms, but it is because I am trying to find the right context and a proper understanding of the terms. Even things like "Gonzo" was unfamiliar to me up until recently, I would think all RP are guilty of using their own made up language and using popular cultural idioms and phrases. RP is jargon about jargon I find most of the time, people are not even aware of the amount of nonsense words they are using, and often people know the terminology without the specific connotations.<br/><br/>This is even mandatory at the Forge.  And it's a really good rule (we copied it for our own Italian forum). Talking in actual play terms give you credibility from the beginning, it says that you play (it's not a given in rpg forums), that you think about your playing, and you want to talk about it.  When you talk using forge jargon, people don't know if you are really trying to communicate or you are showing off or posturing.or trying to confuse the discussion.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Personally it is because I want to get a better understanding of the terminolgy of modern RP. To help me talk about the abstract concepts of games, rahter than actual experiences. This might be contra to Forge expectations, but I enjoy describing and understanding the esoteric aspects of gaming, as much as the actual real world events that I have had gaming. <br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Most of my favorite moments in gaming has been to co-write adventures with DMs, I like collaborative creation and story-telling, and find a lot of RPGs very slow in play. Though I am a fan of the mechanisms in games, I use them for a different purpose as intended. So helping to understand the who; what; when; where; why; and how; lets me concentrate on the type of story to write with DMs. I am not so much a fan of 4 players vs a DM style of gaming, and have had enough experince with actors that dominate the games, but I can enjoy the philosphy behind it by inventing a premise of a game or adventures for the troupe. Such as exploring the concept of African Slavery or Nepalese Genocide in Dungeons &amp; Dragons  or AIDS and the influence of modern technology in a Vampire the Masquerade game. There is a lot more of an opportunity in discussing these things, when it does not take two hours to roll some dice.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;The other week I tried to write some stuff about narrative driven resolution, and though I stated at the outset that I was unfamiliar with the exact terminology, people did not try to correct me. So I found myself confused at my own confusion. I am sure anyone reading the thread would think it posturing, but in my OP I asked for help trying to use them properly. If someone wants to think I am stupid, no worries, I have enough faluts that it is not  hard to pick writting and comprehension to fault.  So, yes, I could look like an idiot using words I dont understand the meaning of, but I was just asking for help.<br/><br/>As an example: just a few hours ago I compiled a list of the best actual play threads to learn forge theory (and GNS in particular). You can find it here: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=32931.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=32931.0</a><br/><br/>They are a good example of how the use of actual play examples simplify the communication and understanding of the theory.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I did get a chance to bookmark them before my computer died, thank you Moreno R, Ill try to read them from the library if I get a chance, or ill get around to reading them when I get back online. Thanks, that is the kind of discussion I am looking for, because a lot of it is not in glossary or easy to find, and most people arent willing to point me in the right direction, so thanks.<br/><br/>And about most of the people who play rpgs... they simply don't care. And they are right not to care. They want to play, not to learn some theory and a new language.  Do you want to have a car engineer and a mechanic on the backseats of your car explaining to you how the car was built and how it works, every time you take the car to go to the store? If a game works, you don't need to learn any theory to play it. You need some knowledge of how the damn thing works only if it doesn't really works and you have to fix it by yourself (this last part describe my first twenty years in traditional role-playing by the way...)<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I disagee 100%, everyone that has even played a single session learns some RP theory, and I think the closest that people like that have to a standard lexicon is the in-game glossary.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;So having an accessable theory would allow it to be widely developed, and individauls would be able to take core concepts as being a shared language, and standard communication.<br/><br/>Don't try to force people to be interested in things that they are not interested about.  Play good rpgs with them instead. This is the best way to help people understand better what rpgs can do.<br/><br/>[edit: crossposted with SIX other posts: I type too slowly in English...  :.-(  ]</blockquote>\nThanks for your feedback and comments, the links will be very helpful,<br/><br/>But I actually disagree with your stance, I think 100% of people have an interest in it, or use it. I just think that if someone was able to make it more accessable and encompass a wider range of ideas that there would be only proactive discussion about it.<br/><br/>I can not think of a single role-player that does not have some knowledge of the lexicon and taxonomy of RP Theory.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372310/#Comment_372310" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T05:51:24+00:00" title="April 11, 2012  5:51AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>The Big Model is most certainly not the last, best word - I think everyone who's inclined to do theory is just thoroughly tired of arguing on the Internet right now.

This would be able to be used to develop a standard lexicon, and work within the established models. I would think the material if written by Tweet or similar would make a lot more people happy than a game which tries to be everything to everyone.<br/><br/>This way someone *would* be paid to write a consistent frame-work for discussion, if it provided some use to players and DMs.<br/><br/>It might just be pipe-dreams, but I know that WotC could afford to make a small source-book that established these modern principles (Gygax Role-play Mastery is very old and out of date)<br/><br/>So I think that unless the big companies release every few years an official source-book or manifesto, that it is really up to the RP community.<br/><br/>Also I think that letting any theory go a few years without revision is going to have holes in it.

There are area's that join everyone together like terms like Twink, Munchkin, etc. But there are also terms that divide those sub-cultures as well.<br/><br/>Military still beat up on Military, best example I can give is Navy and Army bars, you don't go in one if your the other and not expect a fight. Same with the sub-cultures of roleplayers, though it's more of a war of words.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Some things could be discussed rather than dismissed.<br/><br/>I have terms "Dice and Numbers" which I use for D&amp;D players whom play the game based on their knowledge of the game and get happy about the stats, the items as a game mechanic. Min-Maxers is another term I use. This kind of labeling puts me squarely in sub-culture of Roleplaying.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Right so how do we get this language accessable to players, because everyone I know uses some RP specific  terminology, though it seems that more people invent terminology that try to establish a shared lexicon.<br/><br/>Look even though I am a roleplayer and I am part of a community that extends round the globe, I don't play in many of the sub-cultures because either I don't like them, and in some cases would like to lay down and avoid them. Also some people, don't like being designated a type of roleplayer, and some of our labels can be down right offensive in the way we use them. Roleplaying is a personal thing, you get attached to your characters and the stories that come with them, so of course it's a touchy area to talk about.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I should not be though, it is just a discussion on a past-time or creative endeavor.<br/><br/>I could blather on for ages about this subject it's one area I am interested in because I do like labels, I could stick labels on roleplayers all day. Just give me a dymo and enough tape and we could all be covered.  I have always thought this kind of thing would make for a great way to fine like minded roleplayers in your local area, and even help you grow as a roleplayer as long as it was used correctly. It's also an invasion of privacy...well I feel it can be.<br/><br/>So I am stopping now.</blockquote>\nWell I would very much like to see established glossaries, even if it just helpful lables such as "Twink" (which to be honest I knew through the gay subculture before I heard it in regards to RPGs). Anything which helps to unify a language of RP is a good thing in my belief.<br/><br/>Thanks for your input and feedback nightweave,<br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372315/#Comment_372315" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T06:05:40+00:00" title="April 11, 2012  6:05AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite><cite>Posted By: Snake_Eyes</cite>&gt;&gt;I would love to see a new glossary written, I cant do it Im dyslexic with severe cognitive disabilities.

It got me thinking about what other people were looking for in play compared to what I was looking for.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Yes, I like to look at it as providing a framework towards sharing ideas of RP, rather than just relating RP experiences.<br/><br/>I think the best thing that comes from defining Creative Agenda is that it validates other people and how they play. They're not doing it wrong, they're doing it different.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Yes, the things I see people getting frustated about seem silly. Such as people stating that "Immersion" can be solved by a game-system, or social contract. Every RP plays a different game to the player next to them, as we all have an individual agenda to be there, though they may be very similar to others.<br/><br/>And, for that, it's a great start.<br/><br/>But I don't see the model doing much more than that. And how could it, with only 3 categories?<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Well I think simplicity is the key to its strength.<br/><br/>I mean, can I define an American's entire political belief structure just by identifying them as Republican, Democrat, or Green party (or pick another 3rd party, or even group all of them, whatever). Of course not. Putting you into one level of categorization based on a tripartate grouping tells me only a little bit about that person and how they feel about any one given issue.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;The GDS division I think can very easily encompass all RP, even very niche games, by being a bit more specific when using descriptors. A game with a very clear concpet of how it is played, by whom, and why and for what reasons, might be able to be described as a singular category, other games, or play experience with need more than a single word to descibe it well.<br/><br/>I usually focus more on larp rather than tabletop roleplaying. So when I looked at theoretical models, I focused on that, and came up with an article called Analyzing Player Motives to Inform LARP Design, which is here: <a href="http://www.mortalisrpg.com/?download=5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mortalisrpg.com/?download=5</a><br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Ill have to wait til I get my computer up and running before I can read it, unless it is availble for direct veiwing rather than download.<br/><br/>In that article, I identified 16 player motives. Motives are multiple things. They are desires that drive decisions, which are revealed in specific, tangible behaviors. And they are the urge to have certain types of interactions - the desire to have to opportunity to make the decisions and exhibit the behaviors.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Sounds interesting.<br/><br/>I think that by breaking things down into much smaller, more specific pieces, motives become something much more actionable than creative agendas are. You can use them as a designer to make specific decisions about what you put into your game.<br/><br/>You might find something like that more tangible and easier to talk about with people.</blockquote>\nSure, but I think that if it could be defined using traditional and established taxonomy it might be really helpful.<br/><br/>Ill have to find a way of reading it before I can comment on it sorry,<br/><br/>Thanks for your comments, and discussion of alternative models, I look forward to reading it,<br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372320/#Comment_372320" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T06:48:38+00:00" title="April 11, 2012  6:48AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>But I don't see the model doing much more than that.

I think that people want different things from playing even similar games. (My comment regarding this example was that some people want to act out in character, and sometimes someone just wants to hang out with their friends around a table, we view what we see as "serious" depends on the individual player).<br/><br/>I dont think GNS can solve any of these problems, it just helps us to have the tools in which we can constructively negotiate and reach a point where our expectations and agenda is known.<br/><br/>I am looking for something other than that from GNS, and that is just to find something which could be considered a RP "standard" which wont invoke arguments, and allow to describe these elements, and ask questions regarding specific aspects of RP, not only the play, but the theory behind it.<br/><br/>Though I can understand why trying to get everyone using the same contract and agenda is prolly the ideal for each group, most troupes problems seem to arise when one player wants something other than what the rest of the troupe wants. And generally harmony is because everyone is playing for the same reason (weather it is spoken or unspoken agena).<br/><br/>Thanks for your involvement in this discussion RobMcDiarmid, it is very helpful to see the uses of GNS in a proactive way,<br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372327/#Comment_372327" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T07:27:16+00:00" title="April 11, 2012  7:27AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>And if that's true, then, in my mind, that makes the concepts even less useful for anything other than doing group therapy on your gaming group.</blockquote>\nCA was initially based on observation of what conflicts at the table. Try to use<i>CA itself</i>(as opposed to any one of the proposed CA families; they're useful on their own) for much besides said therapy, and you pretty quickly get a hard-cases-make-bad-law effect. Conflict is pretty complicated.<br/><br/>I think asking (or reflecting on):<br/><br/>Who; What; When; Where; Why; and How we RP<br/><br/>has more use than just therapy sessions,<br/><br/>And I would think that most people that RP ask these kind of questions, they just might not know the best way to go about it, to get the most from the questions they are asking.<br/><br/>Though I do not doubt the validity of using the classification to address social contracts, and personal agenda, but I strongly disagree with that is all they are limited to as tools.<br/><br/>I think also the old saying "The exception that proves the rule" is helpful to remember as there will always be some cases where it is not clear what classification to follow, though I think with some work all RP can be classified with TBM.<br/><br/>Sometimes it might be as simple as following up with a few questions to address why RP XYZ does not fit into a classic model, could help, as maybe the answer just needs another perspective?<br/><br/>Thanks though for your continued input and discussion misuba,<br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372337/#Comment_372337" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T08:01:10+00:00" title="April 11, 2012  8:01AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: Snake_Eyes</cite><a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Why&amp;Mode=like">#Why</a> do we define games?</blockquote>To understand them.

These things usually only had a small change to how I played, but a lot of people that encountered my methods of drifting, where very objectionable to calling it AD&amp;D. They said it changed the game too much.<br/><br/>Something as simple as group narrative in place of GM Fiat to D&amp;D seems to change the style of the game, even if the same ephemera and mechanisms are in place. I think that a lot of the social contracts and creative agenda can shape the kind of play experience as much as changing the rules behind the game.<br/><br/>That said, I find that playing a drifted game without expectations leads to the best results, and most of my favorite DMs have been under 10, or people that never played any RP before (Such as getting people around the dinner table to write stories involving RP tropes). I also find that playing with people with a vastly different agenda and play style, when you can cooperate, and share control, can lead to some of the most exiting games, and unique and interesting stories.<br/><br/>Do you think that your model is based on the foundation of GNS?<br/><br/>Are you going to make a model of your theory and put it somewhere on the internet?

I cant think of a model which does not address Edwards' concpets of Creative Agenda.<br/><br/>As some people mentioned before about reinventing the wheel, I think that there are many fundamental truths in GNS/ TBM that to dismiss them would be to dismiss RP Theory outhand.<br/><br/>Of course there are other methodology of classification, depending on what people wish to get out of their own models, but since Kim, Tweet, Edwards all seem to have some shared language to their theory and dicussion IMHO it would be best to use that as a foundation for any future works or writing in the area.<br/><br/>Not to say that it would be impossible, (as another member has mentioned alternatives which are not modeled on GDS) but I think that it would need some peer review before it could be taken as seriously as TBM fundamentals.<br/><br/>I see a lot of MMORPG models that use separate classification to areas of TBM, but I think that traditional games are *not* the same as interaction through the interwebs. Though they may share many aspects and elements, and even some models may encompass both types of RP. I personally see a pragmatic view to using an established model, and augmenting it with individual ideas rather than dismissing the previous decades of work on the subject.<br/><br/>Saying that I feel that the TBM is prolly as close to perfect at the moment, not that it is flawless or without faults, but it can not be dismisssed offhand as it does provide a classificiation of RP, that a lot of other models seem to overlook.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_372342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372342/#Comment_372342" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T08:29:39+00:00" title="April 11, 2012  8:29AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2012 10:51AM by TomasHVM.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, the 3-step model is not based on GNS.

If he is lucky it may produce something even better. ;-)<br/><br/>The METHOD invented by the game-smith, is defined as "how we play the game" (the full tool-set, and our use of it), and is usually divided into <br/>- TECHNIQUES of dialogue, story-telling and leadership<br/>- MECHANICS of numbers, resolution-rules, dice, cards and whatnot<br/>- but not limited to these; anything that may be used to strengthen the game is indeed part of the method<br/><br/>- SETTING is a part of the method too, in the way it is presented for use in the game, as elements of play, to inspire the players and help their interaction produce high quality fiction (in other words; a very important tool in presenting an inspired vision, in the hands of great game-smiths).<br/><br/>I have invented this model for understanding role-playing games, after years of discussing rpgs, to bring some clarity to my thinking on these games.

The whole article is 20 pages long, so it's not ideal for pasting in. But the main gist is this - people are looking for things in games, you can identify what things someone is looking for by observing behaviors, you can place affordances into a game (opportunities for a player to find those things) to help a player find what they're looking for. <br/><br/>And these are the types of things I've identified that players look for (keep in mind that this is a list that focuses on live combat larp play, and adjustments are necessary to apply it to tabletop, but I think that's probably obvious):<br/><br/>Audience - Experience a satisfying narrative<br/>Catharsis - Experience emotions through the character<br/>Comprehension - Figure things out. Solve problems and puzzles.<br/>Competition - Win at something, or at least enjoy the act of competing.<br/>Crafting - Create non-ephemeral things (costumes, props, documents, etc.)<br/>Education - Take away new knowledge or understanding as a player.<br/>Embodiment - Make decisions based on character background, knowledge, and motivation.<br/>Exercise - Enjoy physical activity and movement.<br/>Exploration - Experience the fictional setting.<br/>Exhibition - Show off (costumes, props, acting chops, mad skillz, etc.) and get kudos.<br/>Fellowship - Enjoy time with friends (also includes flirting and such).<br/>Flow - Enjoy losing oneself in the moment.<br/>Leadership - Be important to the player community.<br/>Protagonist - Be important to the story and impact the game world.<br/>Spectacle - Experience the awesome stuff (pretty costumes, elaborate sets, funny NPCs, etc.)<br/>Versatility - Collect important things (spells, lore, favors, etc.) and have the right thing at the right time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Keep in mind that these motives are intentionally atomic. Many things that people talk about enjoying in a cluster and give one name to are broken down into components in this list very much on purpose. <br/><br/>Many of the disagreements and misunderstandings I've seen come from people assuming, for example, that a bigger idea always contains all of the smaller ones for everyone who enjoys any of them.<br/><br/>For example, people who are classified as "Gamist" are often assumed to like Competition, Comprehension, Versatility, and, in a live combat game, Exercise (usually sword fighting or sometimes physical challenges). But I can easily think of a friend who likes Comprehension and Versatility but avoids Competition and Exercise. He's also big into Exploration - he knows the lore documents of the game inside and out and is disappointed when NPCs that represent a given in-game culture don't know their lore well. By using this list of motives, I can describe him as a unique individual (not a person who fits into one of three camps) and know how to put content into an event that will make him happy. I find that EXTREMELY useful in a day-to-day way, whereas I find TBM to only be good for abstract ivory tower analysis.<br/><br/><br/>Here's the thing - TBM assumes (or, to be fair, I assume after reading it) that the players in a game all need to be working toward the same creative agenda in order to have productive play. But when you're working with groups of 20-50 or more players, that level of agreement just isn't going to happen. With that many people, you're bound to get some amount of incoherence.<br/><br/>I think that by using a vocabulary of motives, players and organizers can have a more fruitful dialogue about what people are looking for. Organizers can advertise more effectively about what elements they are planning to support heavily and how. Players can more effectively describe what they are looking for, and perhaps help other players get what they are wanting. And organizers can observe their players and identify more effectively what motives are present that are not being addressed.<br/><br/><br/>Discussions of The Big Model (I've started reading some of Moreno's linked threads at the Forge) tend to assume that the mechanics and ephemera and color and character and all that are just means to an end. That by focusing on those things, people are not seeing the forest for the trees. But trees, man. Those are important. Some people really like elms a lot more than pine. Some people like climbing and others like turning them into cabinets and still others love to watch things burn. Sure, it's a forest, and that's great. But man, look at all those trees.

I'm not very keen on placing these terms into my system. They come with content that mislead as much a clarify. The reason I have developed this system of thought, is to keep it simple, so my thinking on the complexity of role-playing games can retain the clarity needed to reach a deeper understanding. <br/><br/>When applying the 3-step model in my thoughts and talks on role-playing games, I can extrapolate whatever needed for understanding single elements at play, while the simple model does not confuse the issue; it allows me to keep the whole of picture in my mind at the same time. I find that quite liberating, and strengthening, in both my discussions and my design.<br/><br/>The Big Model is too complex to offer an encompassing understanding of role-playing games, in my view.<br/><br/>I do not believe in complex systems of thought.

I would give it a look if there is a page where I can view it as a PDF.<br/><br/>And these are the types of things I've identified that players look for (keep in mind that this is a list that focuses on live combat larp play, and adjustments are necessary to apply it to tabletop, but I think that's probably obvious):<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Well somewhat there are some aspects which are of a primary focus for LARP where traditional games often can have motivation separate from LARP. Such as participating in simulation of warfare, seems not to be the primary focus where both Social and Creative aspects are the general reasons to play. But saying that I have encountered LARP that had detailed simulation mechanisms, though I agree that LARP generally has a social contract that is biased towards certain axis of classification.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I think that these are a good way of detailing and classifing divisons of GNS, though I would think that if they are creative agenda, that they could be placed somewhere within the GNS spectrum.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that these motives are intentionally atomic. Many things that people talk about enjoying in a cluster and give one name to are broken down into components in this list very much on purpose.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Have you thought to write a wikipedia page on your work?<br/><br/>Many of the disagreements and misunderstandings I've seen come from people assuming, for example, that a bigger idea always contains all of the smaller ones for everyone who enjoys any of them.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I think that they offer generalizations, to help people understand the nature of each of the three axis, I dont think that the generalizations are needed for anything other than outlining the concept of GNS. Using them to classify RP, they should be simply stated where they fit into the model as a whole, there is no need for generalizations at this point.<br/><br/>For example, people who are classified as "Gamist" are often assumed to like Competition, Comprehension, Versatility, and, in a live combat game, Exercise (usually sword fighting or sometimes physical challenges). But I can easily think of a friend who likes Comprehension and Versatility but avoids Competition and Exercise. He's also big into Exploration - he knows the lore documents of the game inside and out and is disappointed when NPCs that represent a given in-game culture don't know their lore well. By using this list of motives, I can describe him as a unique individual (not a person who fits into one of three camps) and know how to put content into an event that will make him happy. I find that EXTREMELY useful in a day-to-day way, whereas I find TBM to only be good for abstract ivory tower analysis.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I just classify "Gamist" as Social Agenda, that is all. If the primary reason is to socialize then it is gamist.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I think by accepting that each player can have a mix of the three agenda is key to understanding the descriptors. There is at least 12 discreet agendas when you use multiple classification, by using it similar to a Venn diagram, there is overlap, as well as single agenda. Also there is dominant traits, that I refer (incorrectly prolly, but this is my internal language) as Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;For example a game with Primary Simulation Secondary Game and Tertiary Narrative, while having all three agenda is going to very different to having all three agenda with Primary Narrative, Secondary Game, and Tertiary Simulation.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Simply by saying that a RP has the three agenda does not classify the RP, there needs to be a discriptor to why and how the agenda is defined, how the three agena are mixed, and with what bias and ratio, even if it is simply a pure axis of the triad it needs to have a discription of why it is a "pure" axis of the triad. A Narrative with no Simulation and Game, is going to be different to a Narrative with some Simulation and/ or Game. By acknowledging where the other axis are (or arent) helps to define the RP as much as relying on a single primary trait to convey the information.<br/><br/>Here's the thing - TBM assumes (or, to be fair, I assume after reading it) that the players in a game all need to be working toward the same creative agenda in order to have productive play. But when you're working with groups of 20-50 or more players, that level of agreement just isn't going to happen. With that many people, you're bound to get some amount of incoherence.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I disagree with that completely, people can have different views on the social contract and creative agenda. There are plenty of aspects which create or disrupt harmonious play.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Also with LARP (Esp one with some dress code) you have basically created a social contract which brings players that are naturally like minded, you prolly dont find a random wargamer turning up for a Dress-Up LARP without some understanding of the social contract. And any regualr to the scene is going to have a very clear idea of the contract, and what it means.<br/><br/>I think that by using a vocabulary of motives, players and organizers can have a more fruitful dialogue about what people are looking for. Organizers can advertise more effectively about what elements they are planning to support heavily and how. Players can more effectively describe what they are looking for, and perhaps help other players get what they are wanting. And organizers can observe their players and identify more effectively what motives are present that are not being addressed.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Sure, though someone like myself who wou;ld find that very useful, would prolly just put the various agendas somewhere within the three agendas. I am sure with a little thought there would not be a single one of the motivations that could not be classified within the conventional creative agenda.<br/><br/>Discussions of The Big Model (I've started reading some of Moreno's linked threads at the Forge) tend to assume that the mechanics and ephemera and color and character and all that are just means to an end. That by focusing on those things, people are not seeing the forest for the trees. But trees, man. Those are important. Some people really like elms a lot more than pine.

A Robin Hood game set in medieval England is going to play differently to most people than if it was set in Space Ship. Same with a motif of Lords vs Pesants, will make the same "steal from the rich to give to the poor" if you said something like the Rich are all white people, and the poor are all native people. By simply changing the motif with one or two words can create a difference experience with a the way shared imagination happens. Even though the same basis for the games is a simple Robin Hood story.<br/><br/>Personally I see each aspect of TBM as capable of influencing game experience. Social Contract more than anything (IMO), and things like Ephemera just getting in the way. Ill play D&amp;D with three coins if I dont have a d8, and I have even gone to the effort of reproducing a 1d12 by putting an arrow on both sides of a coin and reading it as a clock-face. Though I would think a lot of arguments I encounter seem to be focused on the techniques, and mechanisms.<br/><br/>Does not mean that I think Ephemera should be ignored, as some games the basis for being enjoyed is on the tools they use.<br/><br/>And people having different agenda, well sometimes that conflict is more of an enjoyable persuit than people that all share the same agenda, but seprate social contract.<br/><br/>Thanks for giving some feedback on your model RobMcDiarmid, and I look forward to being able to familiarize myself with it,<br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji"

welcome!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Snake_Eyes</cite>I am a bit confused though, ...<br/><br/>If I am understanding you right, Vision equates (roughly) to Social Contract, and Creative Agenda. And Interaction and Fiction equates (roughly) to Exploration, Techniques, and Ephemera?</blockquote>I give you the 3-step model as a comprehensive and independent system of thought on role-playing games. I'm not very keen on placing these terms into my system. They come with content that mislead as much a clarify. The reason I have developed this system of thought, is to keep it simple, so my thinking on the complexity of role-playing games can retain the clarity needed to reach a deeper understanding.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Ah Okay,<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Is your model complied anywhere ,or has it been formulated within the story-games forum?<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Though I might not agree with your model (I think GNS/ TBM to be very good) it would be nice to have an alternative simple model up for peer review.<br/><br/>When applying the 3-step model in my thoughts and talks on role-playing games, I can extrapolate whatever needed for understanding single elements at play, while the simple model does not confuse the issue; it allows me to keep the whole of picture in my mind at the same time. I find that quite liberating, and strengthening, in both my discussions and my design.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Cool, do you have a complete model, or is it cutrrently a work in progress?<br/><br/>The Big Model is too complex to offer an encompassing understanding of role-playing games, in my view.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I strongly disgree, TBM is a very simple and straitforward model (IMO), I just think some of the lexicon could be used differently (Though I am sure there were very good reasons at the time for using that langauge), but when it clicks it does encompass each of the areas that I consider when I examine RP. Maybe this is only because it needs to be reviewed, and I also think that the wikipedia article could be brushed-up a little too.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I would have thought that you could not get simpler, and if anything that its taxonomy and classification were simplified and lacked some details, but I feel that all components and elements of RP as clearly defined, and there is not any "spare parts" which could be trimed. IMO there is no fat to be cut, though parts of TBM could be redefined possibly, and probably renamed, but I fail to see any major ommission, and could see an aspect of the classifications as not needed?<br/><br/>I do not believe in complex systems of thought. Let us keep the system simple, so our powers of contemplation can work with clarity.<br/><br/>Yes totally agree TomasHVM, but surely your model needs to able to talk about the exact same things as TBM does, even if you are putting them into different words, or schools of behavior? The same experince (role-play) is being classified, and although you classify it another way, you are still defining the same experiences, just using another language to do so?<br/><br/>Thanks for your feedback and input into the discussion, I am trying to understand your model from the thread, is there a place where it is all put into one place? Does it have any graphics that go along with it?<br/><br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372406/#Comment_372406" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T12:42:18+00:00" title="April 11, 2012 12:42PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the thing.<br/><br/>According to The Big Model, if you have functional play that doesn't have incoherence, you have one and only one creative agenda. That doesn't mean that you don't have competition or narrative or simulation elements present. But you always only have one creative agenda.<br/><br/>That's what the model says. If you're looking at it like a 3 bubble Venn diagram, you're not using the model as designed. You're using something else inspired by it and misrepresenting what it says.<br/><br/>Look at Moreno's links to Forge threads. I've started reading them but haven't finished. But Ron's pretty clear and adamant on that point.<br/><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>That's why I made a different list and gave it a different name. Because I don't want to confuse the tools I find useful with another set of tools that are vaguely related but similar on some key points.<br/><br/>Personally, I think my list of Motives is much more useful in designing events, especially for a known group of players whom one has been able to observe at play before.<br/><br/>And also, I think it's possible to have productive play with a group that has different priorities. It's easier if the group recognizes each other's priorities and is willing to feed them, even when they differentiate from one's own. I think that's what Levi was trying to express in his initial thread with Ron (in the first Frostfolk thread Moreno links to). And I don't think analyzing his group in terms of identifying their Creative Agenda did anything at all to help him express that idea and pick apart how it was working for his group. I think my Motives list is a tool far better suited to that task, though arguably not perfect, largely because it was designed with larp in mind rather than tabletop. Like using a flat head screwdriver on a combo slot/phillips screw - it gets the job done but can result in some slippage you might not get with a different tool.<br/><br/>I can't make a Wikipedia page on my concept until it has more recognizable relevance (such as many people discussing it on many blogs, forums, and articles, like you get with The Big Model). You can't just come up with an idea and make a wiki page for it - the community will take it down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372408/#Comment_372408" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T12:46:42+00:00" title="April 11, 2012 12:46PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2012 12:48PM by Snake_Eyes.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite><cite>Posted By: Snake_Eyes</cite><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>For me it's all about the interplay between constraints and creativity. It's not something I've sought to formalise because it's about interplay and so isn't fixed. I do observe the pathologies of different instances of play and generally I can respond to improve the general level of enjoyment if there is an issue (such as asking players not to make jokes in the scary bits of a horror game) but I've yet to see a model which has this level of responsiveness. Much of the classification involves a level of judgement about different styles of play that I'm not happy with.</blockquote>\nWould you mind giving a further explanation, I am a bit lost to why you have those views? Maybe I am just misinterpreting you, or misunderstanding your comments?<br/><br/>Personally I thought that the idea of having a model to classify RP Theory would be to impartial and without judgement?<br/><br/>Is there something within TBM that premotes some kind of bias or judgement?<br/><br/>I would have thought that TBM premotes the idea that players have different motivations for playing, not that "they are doing it wrong", have I missed something from your post?<br/>A lot of it is in the choice of vocabulary, ephemera for example suggests something which is contingent, passing and not worthy of great interest, incoherence suggests something garbled and unintelligible, illusionism suggests some dirty trick. Words are loaded and they have to be chosen far more carefully if one is to avoid value judgements before you even begin to understand what they mean (and for something slightly outside story games, look at Robin Laws<a href="http://robin-d-laws.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/false-dichotomy-or-real-though-annoying.html" rel="nofollow">analysis of Monte Cooks fluff v crunch</a>).<br/><br/>Okay, I understand the criticsms that the lexicon could be better, but the classification I am 99% happy with.<br/><br/>Ephemera, could be "tools" or "paraphernalia" but it does not seem to have negative connations, or is there something I am missing?<br/><br/>Illusionism, I do not think that is part of TBM? Could you please explain that one to me? I would have that just fell under the "Techniques" heading?<br/><br/>Right, some times people use words as a value judgement "Swine" has deliberate connotation.<br/><br/>What I think GNS, and TBM do is the opposite of that, by giving a neutral and impartial langauge it is only through personal language and interpretation that a value judgement can be made. AFAIK there is no value or judgement form TBM, it is just "people have other reasons for playing" rather than "you are playing wrong".<br/><br/>For example "Gamism" seems to be used to deride people as bad sports, and whatever. But to me the creative agenda known as Gamism ust means that the player is there for a social experience. Some people have a social time, by giggling with friends, other people have a social time by being player killers. But both follow the "Gamism" agenda by being there for a social experience.<br/><br/>I do not think GB Steve, that you need to be putting value judgements with using TBM, it says more about the person using the model, than the model as a tool.<br/><br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372412/#Comment_372412" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T12:51:38+00:00" title="April 11, 2012 12:51PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Victorian!<br/><br/>Some of your replies are difficult to read because your words are placed inside the quotes from the posts you are replying to. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Snake_Eyes</cite><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>But I don't see the model doing much more than that.

THESE parts (characters, setting, color, techniques, etc.) can be divided in a lot of different categories. But when you see if it's more important A or more important B, there are only two answer (three if you count incoherence A=B))<br/><br/>It's simple answer, at the end of the entire game you played (a evening? three weeks? Two years? No matter, a entire game from star to finish) At the end, what you say about the game? Was A more important, thinking of the entire game start to finish, or it was B?<br/><br/>They are not "categories" at all.<br/><br/>The long and detailed explanation, from Ron's mouth (Keyboard) can be found here:<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=32931.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=32931.0</a><br/><br/>Ah okay, could you help me understand what you mean by "Spin"? Is there a specifc thread that deals with this?<br/><br/>No, I used "spin" to make an example without using any technical word (to avoid adding to the confusion). It's an example of something that can only be one way (clockwise) or another (counterclockwise), like the Creative Agenda. Every whipping top is different in color , size, et and you can spin it faster or slower, but these differences are tied to other characteristics (size, mass, moment, color, etc.) exactly like every game "unit" is different from another, but this doesn't mean that the CA are "categories" more than "clockwise" is a category. A Step on Up game is different from every other because there are different characters, situations, players at the table, etc, but "step on up" is "step on up", not "one kind of step on up". The CAs are 3, not 3 categories.<br/><br/>(by the way, this is one of the changes in Forge Theory: if you look a the first articles from ten years ago, they talk about categories, or "GNS Modes". This changed in 2003 with the "publication" of the Big Model that separated the concept of creative agenda (that at the time was called Premise of the game) from the different "levels" of the model.

That doesn't mean that you don't have competition or narrative or simulation elements present. But you always only have one creative agenda.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Right there is a primary focus to the creative agenda. That is why I use "Primary" "Secondary" and "Tertiary" as descriptors, it does not quantify the individual weight at this point, it just says "here is the main agenda, these play a part, but not to the same extent".<br/><br/>That's what the model says. If you're looking at it like a 3 bubble Venn diagram, you're not using the model as designed. You're using something else inspired by it and misrepresenting what it says.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I am not trying to misrepsent it, I never said this was anything but my own invention. And am not trying to pass it off as Edwards, or anyone elses. As I said in that one post that it is only my personal and internal langauge, take it as what you will, but I never said anything contrary to that it was my way of defining creative agenda, that works for me.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I am aware of the conflict between the discreet agendas.<br/><br/>Look at Moreno's links to Forge threads. I've started reading them but haven't finished. But Ron's pretty clear and adamant on that point.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Some of them are broken, but yes, thank you RobMcDiarmid for linking those threads, but I will remake this point, it will take me several reads to get a grasp of what is being talked about over several threads, with multiple participants. Where as the wikipedia articles on RP Theory I found that I understood as well as I do now, after about 5 minutes, they make perfect sense to me, though I use my own language and categories, because when I started RP I was a child in a rural community, I did not have the internet to communicate ideas with or even people interested in RP theory and dynamics. Therefor it is only natural to have a personal langauge, rather than a shared one.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I like TBM (and GDS/ GNS) because all of them seem very clear and complete models. However I am allowed to have my own interpretation without it being a misrepresntation of the ideas presented. They are just like my personal opinion, man!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>That's why I made a different list and gave it a different name. Because I don't want to confuse the tools I find useful with another set of tools that are vaguely related but similar on some key points.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Okay, I am really looking forward to seeing the complete model presented.<br/><br/>Personally, I think my list of Motives is much more useful in designing events, especially for a known group of players whom one has been able to observe at play before.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Sure, but then it is a specialized model, where TBM is a theory for classifying RP. Right?<br/><br/>And also, I think it's possible to have productive play with a group that has different priorities. It's easier if the group recognizes each other's priorities and is willing to feed them, even when they differentiate from one's own. I think that's what Levi was trying to express in his initial thread with Ron (in the first Frostfolk thread Moreno links to). And I don't think analyzing his group in terms of identifying their Creative Agenda did anything at all to help him express that idea and pick apart how it was working for his group. I think my Motives list is a tool far better suited to that task, though arguably not perfect, largely because it was designed with larp in mind rather than tabletop. Like using a flat head screwdriver on a combo slot/phillips screw - it gets the job done but can result in some slippage you might not get with a different tool.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Sure if your model is to describe LARP agenda, it prolly wont work to define tabletop agenda. Though the division of your motives could probably be expressed with using TBM language, you just prolly have no need for describing Simulation (at a wild guess), what I mean is that someone could prolly put your model within the creative agenda, but your model does not encomass the entirity of TBM. Right?<br/><br/>I can't make a Wikipedia page on my concept until it has more recognizable relevance (such as many people discussing it on many blogs, forums, and articles, like you get with The Big Model). You can't just come up with an idea and make a wiki page for it - the community will take it down.</blockquote>\nOkay prolly should not have said Wikipedia, I guess I just meant a wiki in general. Is your model on any wiki? Such as the story-games wiki?

Remeber some people started playing RP with a very strong commmunity, and access to internet and modern theory.<br/><br/>I had been playing for ten years before someone explained even some of the basic terminolgy used today, unless as piece of RP lexicon was part of the D&amp;D glossary, or in a White Wolf book (I dont even remeber them having a glossary tbh) I would invent my own language for the terms. As I said before I had a lot of difficulty understanding "Bang!s" because I had hundreds (literally) of separate terms for the one idea. Things like Tweet's classification of resolution mechanics, I only found as a teenager, and because I was able to understand them (while having a very different personal language) I was able to addopt the FKD resolution terminology, but for 10 years of roleplaying I would have classified them very differently.<br/><br/>Having a shared language might be two different things to us. I am happy having a lexicon established for me, that I can understand, and TBM does that for me. Though I personally use a seprate internal language for it, and do view some of it with a different personal philosophy.<br/><br/>Though I see the creative agenda as being able to be mixed, does not mean I do not understand the creative agenda, it just means that internally I still have my own language to describe agendas. I am not trying to say mine is better. If you read my posts in fact I strongly urge others to not take me very seriously as I have several cognitive disabilities. But I can still say "this is what I see" "this is how I use these tools".<br/><br/>I really do appriecate the effort you have gone to in compling those lists. Ones such as Darkshires, suggested reading, and The Forges recommended articles I find are very inciteful. And if was on my computer at home (at a firends house atm, and prolly will be heading home soon as it is 7am now) I would give all of the threads not just a read over, but I would read them twice, to try and get a better understanding, as some of them are communication between people with a common set of understanding, maybe more so that the wikipedia article is a "primer" for beginers.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes<br/><br/>**Excuse the worse than normal spelling, my friends PC does not have spell-check and I have been up all night.** Thanks                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372428/#Comment_372428" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T13:53:13+00:00" title="April 11, 2012  1:53PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: Snake_Eyes</cite>... surely your model needs to able to talk about the exact same things as TBM does, even if you are putting them into different words, or schools of behavior?

The words that open and close quotes are "blockquote" and "/blockquote", inside the tag signs ), but the easier way when you are composing a post is simply to select only a block of text at a time and click "quote". This put the selected text in a separate quote.\n<blockquote>So Ill ask some very simple questions,<br/><br/>The essays on Darkshire, and The Forge, that they are pretty much the standard right?<br/><br/>Do you think wikipedia does a good job of showing TBM?</blockquote>\nI am not very familiar with the essays on Darkshire, I don't remember what they say.<br/><br/>At the Forge, as I said, the essays are a historical record. They say "at this time, in 2001 / 2002 /2003 /2004 / etc  this was the state of the theory.".  So you should not read them in chronological order, but in reverse order (so you will read the essay that say "the word x now mean y, and x is called z" before reading the essays with obsolete terms.  I can't count the people who didn't know this, read only the 2001 essay, and got really confused by things like the radical change in the meaning of "Premise")<br/><br/>But I suggest don't even try to read the theory essays before having read the threads I listed. The threads are the teaching texts, they were written to explain the big model in practice, using real play examples, taking the time to explain every concept in order. They are the introductory course.<br/>The essays are "OK, let's try to make order in what we said in the last years" texts written with a precise reader in mind: someone who did follow the forum discussion and was already familiar with much of what was written. Ron Edwards confirmed many times that they are NOT teaching texts, they are NOT for people who was not already participating in forge discussions. They will not explain the big model to you if you, they are for refine and deepen an already existent understanding. (and threads are better even at that, too)<br/><br/>What the essay will do, if you read them first, is make you BELIEVE that you understand the Big Model. But without a real conversation, without real actual play examples, 99% of the time you will simply "map" what you read to your own experience in a wrong way.  Most of the people who did read the essays first (and only) were the culprit in most of the misunderstanding of the theory around, telling everybody that "gamist" mean "use dice" or something like that. Please don't do that. There is already enough confusion around.<br/><br/>The Big Model wikipedia article is... OK, I suppose, but has the same problems of the essays, multiplied by the reduction in word count. You shrink a subject that is already confusing into 1/20 of the space, and you don't get a teaching text, you get a text twenty times more confusing. To this add that the article is OK this evening, but could be altered to say something completely different tomorrow.   The last time I checked the GNS wikipedia article for example it was full of errors, some of whom I suspect were put there with malice.(I don't know if it was corrected in the meantime)<br/><br/>The image of the model used in the english wikipedia article has a funny error, too: the arrow goes past ephemera.  Where it goes? Quantum roleplaying? When we changed the image for the italian traduction of Emily article (see later)  Ron insisted to have that corrected. You can find the (much longer) Italian wikipedia page about the Big Model here: <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Model" rel="nofollow">http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Model</a>. THAT image was checked with Ron before posting it.<br/><br/>The article I was talking about is the summary of the Big Model that was written in 2008 by Emily Care Boss for the 2008 Solmukohta Book, <a href="http://2008.solmukohta.org/index.php/Book/Book" rel="nofollow">Playground Worlds</a> (in English).  I did translate that (with some correction and addition from Ron and Emily, like the new diagram for example) in Italian for the InterNosCon 2010 book <a href="http://www.internoscon.it/pdf/INC_Book_2010.pdf" rel="nofollow">Riflessioni Appassionate - pensieri e teorie per giocare col cuore</a> (in Italian)<br/><br/>This is the most up-to-date compendium of forge theory, but it still isn't a teaching text: it's a short summary.

It is praiseworthy, and the more so for being so rare on internet fora.<br/><br/>On theory:<br/>- theory is, to me, a way to explore what I have done; role-playing games. I have played them, led them, and designed them. Being so engaged in role-playing games, as a professional leader and designer of them, I need to understand them. Theory is one way to do that.<br/><br/>But theory comes second to my design and play practice, and second to my continual experimentation with the form. I've designed a lot of role-playing games, and led a lot of game sessions, and I have tested my various games to the point where they are crumbling, or climbing towards imaginary heavens.<br/><br/>My theoretical efforts comes second to my relentless practice and uncompromising experimentations. It is inspired and informed by my extensive catalogue of design, play and discussions through the years.<br/><br/>The model I have made present the quintessence of what I have done. And it is simple; <br/>- <b>The 3-step Model</b> consist of what I have given you here, nothing more. It is, first and foremost, a system of terms, interlinked to give a good overview of what how any and all role-playing games pass through three main stages;<br/>- from the moment of creation (vision)<br/>- through actual game-play (interaction)<br/>- and towards the product of it all (fiction). <br/><br/>The three terms "VISION -&gt; INTERACTION -&gt; FICION" is key to understanding how the full form behave in the various stages, and as a whole. I can say a lot about how it behaves in the <i>vision-stage</i> (the design of games and scenarios, and how players create their own visions within the parameters of a game-method, changing the method in lieu with their own ideas) ...<br/>- but have chosen to focus the model on the second stage; <i>interaction</i>, as that is where most people in rpgs have their practice. <br/><br/>So the model is supported with a set of terms on interaction too;<br/>- <b>the method</b> (how we play) consisting of (but not limited by):<br/>--&gt; <i>the mechanics</i> (material elements)<br/>--&gt; <i>the techniques</i> (human elements)<br/>--&gt; <i>the setting</i> (fictional elements)<br/><br/>We need more words than these to talk about role-playing games, but we do not need much more of a system to get real. We need to see some totality of what we talk about; something akin to <i>the large picture of role-playing games</i>. Until we take into consideration the full extent of practice taking place in role-playing games, from design to product, we will not see what we are talking about. As a result we will discuss ourself into foggy positions time and again. As players and designers invariably do. <br/><br/>A designer or player, or any other man/woman thinking and talking on role-playing games, need to develop a consciousness of the totality of the form. They need to experience the clarity of thought that follows from adopting such a position. <i>The 3-step Model</i> is a way to keep your head clear, when talking role-playing games. It is a reference point, a sound and solid base from which to venture forth in exploration of the form. It is a good position to start your journey into understanding.<br/><br/>So, be my guest; take it and use at your own convenience, in your own way. It has done a lot of difference to me. I hope it will do something for you too.<br/><br/>Have a nice day!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372725/#Comment_372725" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-13T11:02:59+00:00" title="April 13, 2012 11:02AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2012 11:04AM by misuba.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And done.

And it seems to me that Edwards is the conventional in regards to the definition of RP theory. I think his terms such as Exploration, and Techniques, and the aspects of those terms seem like a really natural way of talking about those points. Also when I misuse a word, or fail to understand a concept, just take it at face value, that I probably misunderstand it personally, I am not trying to subvert anyone's thoughts on the subject.<br/><br/>That I do not agree with TBM 100% does not mean that the aspect I disagree with I do not understand. Though I have been mixing up congruence and creative agenda a bit. For example with my belief that multiple creative agenda can be manifest, just means that I think there is a quite common amount of disagreement between personal and group agenda. I would have not said that having some amount of disagreement is a negative thing, just something to be worked out around the table.<br/><br/>I think the only real point of argument that I would make against the single agenda, is that I think it is possible to have * simultaneous* agenda of multiple kinds and still be in a group harmony. I think that you could have a play group with Narrative-Gamist agenda, and it to be as "congruent" as the next play group with a single focused agenda.<br/><br/>If the point of the agenda is that one must be the priority in a agreed agenda, then yes I (mostly) agree. Though that is why I would naturally say that any and all of the agenda can be mixed to varying degrees, and one of the three agenda would be the primary bias. <br/><br/>I read the threads listed on the forum, they where a little help, but there was a lot of talk about specific plays and games. I understand that yall like to include and base discussion on actual play, but I think that because it is theory you can talk about theoretical and "imaginary" games as well as "real" games.<br/><br/>Why is discussion based around a game that might not exist yet, or might not be able to exist any less relevant to discussion than "actual play"?<br/><br/>I have read some of the other articles from The Forge, and found them to be helpful. And I do not mean it to sound critical, but there were a few times that I thought that the glossary and article listing did not answer some questions about current gaming. I am sure that there are many posts that would answer my queries, but Edwards has over 10,000 posts alone, let alone me trying to find relevant posts with discussion across some of the other forum members that I have encountered through articles.<br/><br/>So please do not think I am trying to find fault or insult anyone, I am just quite miffed at some of the concepts around the online RP community. I understand that many of you have had years of this kind of discussion, but I havent, and am just trying to get some clarification, namely in trying to use contemporary RP theory terms (some of which I am unfamiliar with) with the community as a whole.<br/><br/>Thanks for your feedback and comments Moreno R.<br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372924/#Comment_372924" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-15T03:10:18+00:00" title="April 15, 2012  3:10AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: Snake_Eyes</cite>Cool, look forward to reading it when it comes out in English.<br/><br/>Thanks for your time,<br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes</blockquote>I want to commend you for going at this with such an open attitude, and for being so positive and diligent in your responses. It is praiseworthy, and the more so for being so rare on internet fora.<br/><br/>*snip*<br/><br/>Have a nice day!<br/><br/>Thank you very much TomasHVM,<br/><br/>Well I am just trying to find people like yourself, that have a way of internalizing RP Theory, and are currently trying to apply their theory. I mention names like Edwards, Kim, Tweet, a lot because I figure they are well known. And personally I think they all have done some pretty good jobs of describing aspects of theory. I find TBM to be the most "complete" model of RP, and near flawless in execution. To me TBM is a thing of beauty, does not mean that something will be more "shiny" to me at a later date, or that I find it 100% in accordance with my own views.<br/><br/>For example your V&gt;I&gt;F model is very simple, and that is a good thing in its own way. It makes sense, though I do wonder (this may just be my lack of knowledge with it) how many of the aspects that are trimmed from TBM or are merged within categories, I would find missing? Like I think that TBM has the right amount of parts, if that makes sense? That the categories seem to be well defined, I personally (myself) would not have tried to reword them, or change the way they are grouped.<br/><br/>So I prolly just have to say that I am too unfamiliar with your model to have any input or comments at this stage, but I do look forward to reading it in detail so that I *can* make them, or at least have a better understanding of it.<br/><br/>I apologize also for the delay, I am on a friends computer, and I might not be online for a short while. It seems here on story games at least I am making some progress to discussing my goals.<br/><br/>Thanks for your comments, and support,<br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372938/#Comment_372938" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-15T09:59:20+00:00" title="April 15, 2012  9:59AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Snake_Eyes</cite><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>What the essay will do, if you read them first, is make you BELIEVE that you understand the Big Model. But without a real conversation, without real actual play examples, 99% of the time you will simply "map" what you read to your own experience in a wrong way.  Most of the people who did read the essays first (and only) were the culprit in most of the misunderstanding of the theory around, telling everybody that "gamist" mean "use dice" or something like that. Please don't do that. There is already enough confusion around.<br/></blockquote>\nWell personally I would have thought if "Gamist" had to equate with a term, it would be "Social", but again just my personal opinion.<br/><br/>Every Creative Agenda is social.  Well, the very CONCEPT of a Creative Agenda is that the entire group, socially, reinforce, encourage, reward (socially) each other and the game  It's this directly tied to the reward system: a coherent game is a game where the rewards are coherent with the common objectives (for example: all the old "give xp for good roleplaying" rules in old rpgs failed, all of them, because the were incoherent: the GM wants more "role-playing" - with that word probably meaning different things for every GM - and not "powerplaying"...  and to get that, he gives the kind of rewards that encourage powerplaying. Incoherent design at his finest in its history of failures).<br/><br/>The difference is not even "what is rewarded". Every group, always (or at least, always if it works well and it's not dysfunctional), socially reward creativity, intelligence, guts, all of that.  Every single not-dysfunctional group rewards good tactical thinking, for example.<br/><br/>You see the difference looking at the priorities: when these different kind of "good things" for a game are not compatible (like for example the times acting in the most tactical sound way would mean dismiss the character characterization), and everyone has to choose... what is the choice the group socially rewards? Who is playing "well"? Who is playing "badly"?<br/><br/>Incoherence means that you think you are playing well and instead I am thinking in my mind "what he is doing? I never saw anyone playing so badly! Doesn't this guy know how to play a rpg?"  (because usually, if they don't have experience with strongly coherent games, or worse, they play with rule-zero so they play with the same system - let's call this system "what Fred like works, what Fred don't like doesn't works" with Fred as GM - playing with another CA is the same as "don't even play a rpg at all". The history of rpgs is full of people saying that "these people are not even playing a rpg"...)<br/><br/>So, sorry if I came up a little hard here (it's not easy to avoid being too hard and direct talking in another language), but I don't really think you understood what Ron said in these threads.  I am basing this only on the few words I quoted above, not a lot of proof I admit, but thinking that only gamism is social is a very, very big alarm bell.  I don't want to tire your patience, but maybe it would be better if you read the other threads after the first two, too.\n<blockquote><br/>That I do not agree with TBM 100% does not mean that the aspect I disagree with I do not understand. Though I have been mixing up congruence and creative agenda a bit. For example with my belief that multiple creative agenda can be manifest, just means that I think there is a quite common amount of disagreement between personal and group agenda. I would have not said that having some amount of disagreement is a negative thing, just something to be worked out around the table.</blockquote>\nA "personal agenda" is no a creative agenda, is a desire. Simply a desire. You look at the other players at the table and you think by yourself "oh, how would be nice if these people would share my views, and say to me that I play very well, instead of looking at me as I was the worst player in the world, or ignoring me". That is a "personal creative agenda". What it's worth for? Can it make other people encourage your play, if they don't share it? No. So, a personal CA is simply worthless, if it's not reflected in what other are doing.<br/><br/>More that that: a CA is a temporary thing. I play with Gamist, Narrativist or Simulationst CAs all the time, in different games. Because games are different, and every game is to be played in a different way (It's this kind of adaptability that people used to incoherent games usually lacks: having always playing in the same way, they see CA usually as some kind of fixed-for-life mark on the front of the poor players...) . I play D&amp;D to get gold and xp and to win against what the GM did put in the dungeon, I play A Taste of Murder to enjoy a specific kind of homage-parody of a kind of literature, and I play My Life With Master to get passionate play.  I don't play the same game every time, with different covers.<br/><br/>So, having a personal, ever changing agenda is even more worthless: you play D&amp;D one evening, everyone apart you want to kill monster and get gold and xp... but you, secretly, want to play an homage to Agatha Christie? And the next week, everyone want to play a murder mystery set in the '30s in England...  but you secretly want to kill monsters and take their stuff? And do you think it will improve the game?<br/><br/>(OK, the example were exaggerated, probably in the Agatha Christie game you don't want to kill orcs, you are simply playing to prove to the others that you are the best investigator, for example. And you think that everybody else who is not caring a bit about finding the murderer because they are enjoying the Dream are "playing badly"...)<br/><br/>The take-away points are:<br/>- A desire is a desire, not a "personal agenda". If you want (desire) to play a specific game in a specific way, find someone who share that desire, turn it into a group agenda, and then it will matter.<br/>- Don't think that you "have a CA" burned into your soul. Having a CA is like saying "let's play the same game", like "let's play soccer" instead of "let's play chess". Do you have "I want to play soccer" burned into your soul? (or, by the other way, do you think that thinking "I want to play chess, i want to play chess" all the time is a good way to play Soccer?)\n<blockquote>I think the only real point of argument that I would make against the single agenda, is that I think it is possible to have * simultaneous* agenda of multiple kinds and still be in a group harmony. I think that you could have a play group with Narrative-Gamist agenda, and it to be as "congruent" as the next play group with a single focused agenda.</blockquote>\nGroup harmony? Certainly!<br/><br/>If I play with my friends, and I think that one of them is playing very, very badly, I am not surely going to attack him, shame him, or argue with him.  I continue to smile at him, and he still remain my friend.<br/><br/>By to avoid getting angry, I instantly lower my expectations about the game. In the same way this hobby lowered and lowered and lowered it's expectations about "what you can do with rpgs".<br/><br/>It's like playing Soccer. You go into the field thinking that you are going to play a real tough game, a game that will show which team is the best, a "knife between teeth" game where you will give it all to the team. But then...  you see that the other players are playing like they are merely passing the time. Nobody is really running, nobody is really fighting, they are only showing off the way they can make the ball bounce on their feet without making it touch the ground. Nobody is caring about the score.<br/><br/>If you like playing that way, too, you simply reassess the situation and join them.  A sort of "creative agenda" is reinstated.<br/><br/>If you don't like to play that way, or if you really hoped for another kind of game.... what do you do? Do you hit another player on the nose, and storm off shouting four-letter words to everybody? Or you think to yourself "well, this is not a game that I will enjoy very much, but they seem to like it...  let's play, I hope I will find something fun to do during the game..."<br/><br/>If, at a rpg table, the situation is so damaged that people openly shout to others (or do things less overs but not less hostile) you have dysfunctional play. It happen to a lot, really a lot of gaming groups, much more than a lot of people want to believe (there are more people who stopped playing rpgs than people who still do. I believe that most of the people who stopped playing had at least one dysfunctional phase before stopping. This would means that more than half of the gaming groups did become dysfunctional, in time, playing incoherent games), and that a lot of gaming groups avoid getting dysfunctional only by making the "different one", the player who protest, go away.<br/><br/>But you can have incoherent games without having them getting dysfunctional. Everyone here I think has some experience with that. It's the thing that was called by the D&amp;D line developer "twenty minutes of fun in a three hour game". Nobody is arguing, nobody is shouting, you are comfortable,  you like being with your friends, talking, eating, enjoying their presence. And you patiently wait for your "turn" to have fun, letting others have their fun before yours. You are happy that they enjoy their twenty minutes, and sometimes you even listen to what they are doing during that time instead of stuffing yourself with food.<br/><br/>But if someone tell me that playing that way is even a tenth "good" like playing with a common creative agenda, the only conclusion I can get is that he did never, ever experienced one of the two situations he is talking about.  (I would bet 1000 to one that he has never experienced coherent play, but I can't dismiss the possibility that someone, somewhere, never experienced incoherent play. What I can easily dismiss - laughing - it the idea that someone who experienced both could not tell the difference)<br/><br/>So, <br/>1) read the other threads in that list<br/>but, even more than that:<br/>2) play a lot of different coherent games, exactly as they are written (throw rule zero in the only place it belong, the trash heap), with different people, until you get the difference between the CAs and between coherent and incoherent play (I am counting only strongly coherent games. Sorry about the people who only played "traditional games": no matter how many they played, for understanding these things they don't count)\n<blockquote><br/>I read the threads listed on the forum, they where a little help, but there was a lot of talk about specific plays and games.

The second also references similar articles. I found them both to be a useful primer on RP Theory.<br/><br/>I know you prolly dont like someone (me) taking an established theory and putting thier own spin to it, but since I was a teenage in the early 90s I would have categorized agenda in a similar way.<br/><br/>The triad of agenda, I see as three primary motivations to playing. "Gamism" I prefer Social/ Play, and I just mean that the reason why people have this agenda is to have a social experience. (I realize that you would prolly define this as coherence). "Narrative" I would use Creative/ Story that the reason to play is a creative persuit. "Simulation" I would term Game, and I think that the reason that people are playing is because of the game itself.<br/><br/>And RP games themselves can be naturally biased in these ways. i.e. Are there rules for interaction between players? Is there a reward for sharing narrative? Is there a robust game beneath the system?<br/><br/>I would think that incoherence comes about when a player is just playing for a reason that the others around the table are not.<br/><br/>I have had both the experience of coherent and incoherent, I can honestly say that the majority of play has been incoherent. I find that most gaming groups are there to "have a good time" and do not reward anyone in a meaningful way. The core of the RP community locally is Pathfinder and similar games, playing modules they have played multiple times, this is not my idea of RP, or my idea of a "good time". Though it certainly does constitute as a RPG, or traditional game. The other common groups are the DM-actor where for every action I want to perform, I must have my words and actions retranslated by the DM. Btw, they are very "coherent" and share the same creative agenda, it is just that their focus on what is a good time usually equates to "Shooting myself in the head reduces some HP, but intills fear in my enemies." the melodramatic actor, and a unhealthy fixation for playing high level charcters.<br/><br/>Mostly my enjoyment from RP has come from writing, I enjoy the challenge of re-writting established games. I like talking about why does a player feel motivated within a game, also I simply like taking a published game and changing elements until it is playable by the same group without being recognized as the same adventure. I spend a lot of time thinking "why would NPC do that?"<br/><br/>The times I have had the most enjoyment and coherence is when it has been a creative pursuit, and a shared group narrative. I would say I have only exclusively played traditional games. But again I play a lot differently than other players. If you mean by tg "Rule Zero" personally I dismissed that rule when I was 7yo. And I am still a D&amp;Der, rather than a RPer.<br/><br/>I just wanted to say that by talking about "theoretical gaming" I mean just that sharing with others concepts of what gaming is, not trying to talk about my own personal El Dorado. Like if I said "I would like a game that rewards shared narrative" sure nowdays I have plenty of examples, however there was a time where this conept within RPG was purely theoretical.<br/><br/>Discussion in regards to theoretical RPG means just that putting an idea or query out, and asking for advice or feedback. Sometimes I want to be corrected, or to get feedback. But have to strongly disgree that discussion of theoretical games are only true to one person, because all games were theory at some point.<br/><br/>Thanks again Moreno R. for your feedback at comments, I hope I have clarified myself alittle better,<br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16294/why-do-we-define-rp" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16294/why-do-we-define-rp" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16294/why-do-we-define-rp/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F16294%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F16294%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
