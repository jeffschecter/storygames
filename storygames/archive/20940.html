I've been thinking of this both from the perspective of games on demand play at conventions and as an alternative to quick filler boardgames (e.g. Zombie Dice) at social gatherings. <br/><br/>I've noticed a problem that short form RPGs seem to have that filler boardgames don't: It takes a lot longer to transition into smooth "play-mode". Play feels awkward or you feel very uninvested in the fictional situation until you get into proper play-mode. Naturally the more time you need to invest to enjoy a game, the longer you'd like to play to benefit from that investment, which would make RPGs inherently bad for short form gaming.<br/><br/>The reason for the slower transition might be that constructing the shared imagined space takes longer than explaining the rules of Zombie Dice and giving the cup of dice to the first player. It could also have something to do with forming the <a href="http://gamingconceptz.blogspot.fi/2012/10/huizingas-magic-circle.html" rel="nofollow">magic circle</a> for gameplay. Or I might be wrong and trying to approach this problem with the wrong set of techniques.<br/><br/>Have you found this transition problematic for quick RPG play or do you find that the setup phase like character creation is enough for you to transition smoothly into play-mode? Do you have any tricks or techniques to quickly, but smoothly, move people from chit chat to gameplay? <br/><br/>Let's assume that the people in question aren't against the idea of quick gaming, but they haven't mentally prepared themselves ahead of time, as you normally might when you're travelling to your gaming place. It seems clear to me that part of this transition can happen before you hit the table as well as during preliminary chatting. Music, rituals and summing up what happened last time works for campaign play, but these tools aren't available in spontaneous situations.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/empowermint" title="empowermint"><img alt="empowermint" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/empowermint">empowermint</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459520/#Comment_459520" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-23T15:52:39+00:00" title="January 23, 2017  3:52PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2017 3:53PM by empowermint.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I run a biweekly gaming night where myself and some other GMs run one-offs for whoever happens to turn up. We've never actually discussed it, but here are some things we do to make this work:<br/><br/>* If character creation takes more than ten minutes, we make pregens. For some games, I like to create semi-pregens. In D&amp;D, e.g., it's easy to leave the bond, ideal and flaw open for players to choose for themselves.<br/><br/>* We always try to have one player in addition to the GM/facilitator who has read the rulebook or played before. That player takes the first turn and generally leads by example.<br/><br/>* There's a core of c. 12 people who come every week, so generally only one or two people in a given game are 'new'. This makes establishing a friendly atmosphere much faster.<br/><br/>* I personally like to avoid explaining rules until they become relevant, and even then try to focus on 'how to play' rather than 'this is how it works'. If a player takes an action that they will be penalised for in the rules (i.e. trying to be stealthy while wearing plate mail in D&amp;D), I'll warn them about the adverse consequence.<br/><br/>* In a GM-ed game, the story hook has to happen immediately, and has to bring strong genre expectations with it. This helps the players orient in the story - they know roughly what they're meant to do straight away.<br/><br/>* In a complex-rules game, make the story about what the players *decide to do* rather than their abilities/tactical advantages/equipment/mechanics of any sort. That way, they don't actually have to understand the rules in order to participate fully.<br/><br/>* I think it's important to be vocally appreciative of everyone's contributions. Sounds obvious, I know, but rewarding good play a) explains what 'good play' is and b) makes people more confident and therefore comfortable. <br/><br/>* One-page printouts of rules summaries ftw.<br/><br/>* We advertise as meeting at 18:30 and start playing at 19:00. That means people hopefully have their socialising out of their system by the time we divide into tables.<br/><br/>I'd be interested to learn of other peoples' tactics as they would doubless help me out a lot! :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kyleweems" title="kyleweems"><img alt="kyleweems" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/856/nI5M0EM1PN1HG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kyleweems">kyleweems</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459522/#Comment_459522" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-23T17:01:35+00:00" title="January 23, 2017  5:01PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem with such games smoothly starting often seems to me to be one of the theatre of the mind, with the players smoothly transitioning into who they are and what their world is and why they care.<br/><br/>I've found that Lady Blackbird (<a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/</a>) is a good example of how you can quickly immerse people into the game. It's evocative with its characters. You know who you're playing at a glance. The story evokes tropes and reminisces of many popular media franchises like Star Wars and Firefly, allowing for players to roughly sketch the scenario and how they feel about it quickly.<br/><br/>For a game that's not as tightly pre-made, I suppose the real leg work comes from the opening paragraphs of narrative from the GM.<br/><br/>When I've been crushed on time, I try to have a high impact opening that focuses on the action of the moment and gives the players an immediate need to respond while having cues to help them hang their mental hats on. A klaxon sounding that wakes sci-fi pilots to run for their starfighters. A jewel heist where they've got the diamond in their hands only for an errant tool to fall to the floor at the wrong moment. I try to paint enough information as to why they should care, and give enough to feel what the environment is, but focus on the events first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley" title="Simonpaulburley"><img alt="Simonpaulburley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/525/nEVIULR78FJ45.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley">Simonpaulburley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459531/#Comment_459531" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-23T21:45:01+00:00" title="January 23, 2017  9:45PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Empowermint asks for advice when he's already got all the bases covered.

Can't help you out. <br/><br/>I was going to say, running short 1 hr RPGs to introduce people to our great hobby is something I've been doing and intend to do more of. Give the players pregens. Describe the situation, vividly, ask them what they're doing, tell them what dice to roll. Simple.<br/><br/>I've got scenarios for most genres but - for example - to introduce people to "Dungeons and Dragons" I use THE BLACK HACK (roll d20 under a stat to succeed) system and Matt Colville's (YouTube - look him up) example dungeon.

You know who you're playing at a glance.</blockquote>\nThis, and in media res, are great observations.<br/><br/>I usually play games that takes between 45-90 minutes.<br/><br/>One is a Ghostbusters game (<b>InSpectres</b>), where I pitch it by saying "Combining McDonalds, Big Brother, and Ghostbusters". Nowadays, younger people doesn't get the two latter ones. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> That game has a tight (sort of railroady) structure of play, fast character generation, a clear end goal, it's always apparent how far from the end goal they are through the pacing mechanism, and the game is using tropes. It also sets the tone with how the resolution works, and working together on a ghostbusting firm is making the group of characters tight from start. The game starts with a slight briefing of the mission, but after that it's about what the <i>players</i> do.<br/><br/>Another one is an Indiana Jones game (<b>This is Pulp</b>). Pregens, where the players get to read through three each before deciding to play one, the game master explains the setting through name-dropping movies from the genre, the group are creating the world together using tropes from these movies, the game is open with when it ends due to its pacing mechanism, and the first scenes starts with the players taking actions against a immediate threat.<br/><br/>The third one is a purely storytelling game (<b>Imagine</b>). It's set in the present mundane world, one participant is reading some statements to set the participants' mind in the right place, and the group then starts playing by saying one sentence at a time. Everyone gets to actively try to put a story together, in their minds, from the sentences being said. This is a game that has given the group a strong emotional impact by being so deeply immersed in the story, and caring about the characters in the story that they are referring to in third person. The game takes between 60-90 minutes to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Glowie" title="Glowie"><img alt="Glowie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Glowie">Glowie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459555/#Comment_459555" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-24T14:12:14+00:00" title="January 24, 2017  2:12PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent advice! <br/><br/>I try to start all short games with a situation that demands an immediate reaction, but I haven't always used clear situations that build on strong genre expectations. The awkwardness in the first scene is definitely more noticeable if the players don't know what they're supposed to do. It takes time to orient yourself in the situation, especially if you're not given enough information to do so beforehand.<br/><br/>I've also used pregens, though mostly to avoid mechanically time consuming character creation. Adding more evocative detail on the character sheets should introduce both the situation and the character more smoothly, and perhaps importantly, at the player's own pace. This is better than leaving it all for the beginning of the first scene. I feel combining this with an easily approachable first scene should do a lot to ease players into play-mode.<br/><br/>I do like explaining the rules before starting play, primarily to empower the players and show that there are rules that the GM needs to follow as well. I'm not sure if this is really necessary or a good thing when playing with first timers, though. I stick to light systems for quick play and offer rule references if the players want to know everything. Perhaps I should only give an overview of the rules and point to the references for details.<br/><br/>Being energetic in general and appreciating the players' choices vocally helps build momentum once the initial awkwardness subsides. It's quite easy to keep the momentum building for the whole duration of a short game and if this succeeds, the players invariably leave the table smiling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459556/#Comment_459556" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-24T14:31:00+00:00" title="January 24, 2017  2:31PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that half of this is due to how we play: every rpg is a learning experience - often every session is one, and consequently players need to be alert for performance instructions instead of just playing effortlessly. Sometimes we end up with a group and a game where this is not the case - everybody already knows what they're doing - and it all is, in fact, pretty effortless.<br/><br/>Another part is that rpgs often have a somewhat shaky operational baseline, particularly compared to boardgames: you can play a boardgame through entirely without ever "getting into it", and the other players will barely notice, while with rpgs the entire front part of play is often dedicated to a kind of warm-up procedure as the players wait for themselves and others to "get into it". Trying to play without that is difficult because you don't know what you're supposed to be doing, often enough, without having the fictional Situation and Character providing inspiration. In boardgames you can play your turn pro forma even without understanding the deeper strategic issues, and most of the time that's cool.<br/><br/>I've gotten over these issues in short-form games such as <i>Fables of Camelot</i> mostly by having a strong GM conduct the operations of play regardless of player consciousness: as long as you don't care about whether the players are getting into it, and the game has a sufficiency of hooks and interactive procedures, it is technically speaking possible to just barrel ahead as quick as any boardgame until, at around 15-30 minutes into play, the SIS coheres and the players start to actually respond meaningfully. Notably it doesn't seem to matter much what you do while waiting for the players to get into the zone, so in some ways it is quickest and simplest to just play the game until it happens. It's going to be pretty soulless until they do, but at least you'll have something already established once the play starts to click. Sort of like kickstarting an engine repeatedly until it takes.<br/><br/>It is notable that very long campaigns feature very streamlined warm-up routines. Our current D&amp;D group, for example, gets into the zone with just a couple of sentences. The GM basically just states the fictional date and what the group was doing last session, and then asks the party leader what the plan for tonight's session will be. Play begins at that point, and that's it for warmup.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459577/#Comment_459577" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-25T09:49:38+00:00" title="January 25, 2017  9:49AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a shameless plug for a freebie that I wrote, last weekend we played It's not My Future.<br/><a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/180168/Its-Not-My-Future" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/180168/Its-Not-My-Future</a><br/>You deal out playing cards and let the players choose two out of three to create a character and then deal out three more cards to set the scene.

I can stop the narration and just listen to silence for a minute if I'm not careful. Of course, it takes just one active player to keep it rolling, but then it feels like it's not a group game anymore.<br/><br/>It can be tricky to help coach people to participate more in such circumstances.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459605/#Comment_459605" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-25T21:04:51+00:00" title="January 25, 2017  9:04PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not necessarily pushing any kind of direction on the players.

Eventually in a reactive mode, I stop and give them a chance to turn the tables so I'm reacting.

The game doesn't get stuck in the passive mode (at least, not due to pedagogy) because you construct the interactions in a way that encourage and reward the players into cascading interactive cycles the moment they're ready and willing to engage in them.<br/><br/>Concrete example from Fables of Camelot because I've done a boatload of this with that game; when the game starts at Camelot with completely new roleplayers, the interactions are all very simple and largely scripted. Like so:<br/><br/><i>"The knights of the round table have gathered for the Passover Feast, a bit to-do that every knight attempts to join in. The only empty chairs around the table are those of knights currently out on mission, or those presumed dead - they will stand vacant until the Easter Sunday, when they'll be removed from the table.<br/><br/>"This is Passover, though, when new knights are introduced to the highest order of knighthood in the realm. Now, you, player A - your character, knight <i>Ac</i> has been selected to join this august company. The table is round, as king Arthur desires every knight of the table to be equal to each other. As you approach the table, you notice that every knight has their name carved on their chair, and their coat of arms magically etched onto the table itself. (Yes, the table's magic - king Arthur got it as a wedding present from queen Guinevere's folks.)<br/><br/>"The question, is where do you sit? As the knights assemble, many of the seats have obviously been taken, and of course you would not bogart the seat of another noble knight, particularly not one as famous and chivalrous as these, the highest heroes of the realm. As you go around the table, you find that there are [number of new knights to be introduced, +1]  seats empty and unnamed, though. One of the seats is close to the king's, with just Sir Kay, his foster brother in between; another is in between the two boisterous Lords of War, Agravain and Pelleas; [add seats as necessary]; the last of the seats is grander than the others, it is the so-called Siege Perilous, as you have well heard. Where do you sit yourself?"</i><br/><br/>(To clarify, I don't read this off paper when running the game - the passover scene is one of the standard bits in the game, you repeat it with variations all the time as GM, and therefore it becomes rote.)<br/><br/>What this type of backgrounded yet simple question is supposed to initiate is a simple test protocol for communication between the GM and a so-far-unknown player: will they answer simply, hesitantly and matter of factly? Will they ask clarifying questions? Will they describe their character acting in emulation of the GM's storytelling tone, or merely answer the question and expect the GM to continue the storytelling? Will they answer expansively, adding detail, or taking initiative on something more important than seating?<br/><br/>The key feature here is that the baseline of participation is <i>extremely</i> low; as long as the player understands the question ("Where does your character sit?") and gives some sort of an answer, the GM can continue pushing play forward. If they can't answer for some reason, this is a fine time to recalibrate the communication - speak slower, explain things more simply, whatever it takes to achieve the minimum requirements of play. Furthermore, the substance of the player's answer does not matter at all in any causal gameplay sense; whatever the player answers, the GM can use the answer to illustrate the scene and give the player inspirational grist for their character vision, to be used later in play.<br/><br/>Most significantly, as play continues and I "push play forward", the entire process runs off similar interactive query cycles: the players are forced to answer questions with clearly provided alternatives for action; the GM encourages any answer and shows the consequences in a colorful and trustworthy manner. My experience is that as long as the GM brings a bit of skill to the table, this actually suffices for getting the short form game to fire quickly: you essentially hit the ground running and never stop, and sooner or later the other players get swept away by the game's proceedings and start adding their own stuff: they'll want to describe their own characters's actions in more detail, or they'll want to try something you did not suggest as a solution to some problem.<br/><br/>Thus my conclusion: you basically just need to be able to keep the game running for 10-15 minutes in a fluid way, regardless of whether you're running it for the Shakespeare Company or a half dozen tree stumps. If you can do that, keep up the patter, the players will warm up and join in. It seems to me like the rules of the game and most other things don't really matter for this, only the fact that you keep pushing it matters: more storytelling, keep asking them for simple inputs, tell them funny bits about what their choices made happen, demonstrate correct play behavior. Monkey see, monkey do. The ones that react passively even after say 5-10 interactive cycles are not curable within the bounds of a short-form RPG, I think: not everybody plays well together at the drop of a hat, and some people don't have the ability to play well at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Glowie" title="Glowie"><img alt="Glowie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Glowie">Glowie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459620/#Comment_459620" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-26T08:44:30+00:00" title="January 26, 2017  8:44AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2017 8:50AM by Glowie.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That pushing mentality seems to inject the players with enthusiasm and energy until they're chock-full of it and can't help but start playing. That's quite demanding for the GM to do for extended periods at a time at a convention, but if you're there to work, you might as well take it seriously. I'm kind of trying to find shortcuts to this push-until-they-wake-up method, but I think it's the best baseline GMing practice to go for even if you use other techniques on the side.\n<blockquote>Make them care as quickly as you can, even in prep. Give them reasons to care about the fiction, about the situation, about their PCs and the NPCs, ASAP.<br/></blockquote>\nDo you have any practical examples of this that have worked especially well for you? Do you just go with blunt motivations like "your little brother was snatched by the gremlins, go save him!" or do you use subtler ways to make them care? <br/><br/>Creating the situation with the players is one great way to build buy-in when playing long-form games, but I don't think that's the answer for short ones. Short GMful games should do this better, but short GMed games are often quite traditional in their setup: The GM brings the characters and the situation to the table and the players should just adapt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459633/#Comment_459633" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-26T18:46:26+00:00" title="January 26, 2017  6:46PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Depends on the game.
