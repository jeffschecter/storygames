(and his motivational poster), I began thinking about playtesting.   Ryan's episode points out how he approaches playtesting from a designer standpoint.  Jason talks about it from that standpoint as well.   But, other than saying that playtesting may not be fun, they don't talk about how can you be a good playtester.  So help me here.  Is there advice somewhere on the questions you should have in your mind, how to approach playtesting, developing questions for the designer, giving useful feedback, etc.?<br/>\nI think that would be quite helpful.<br/>\ntomg                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208054/#Comment_208054" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T21:44:13+00:00" title="May 18, 2009  9:44PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From playtesting my own games, and some other folks', the thing I keep hearing and saying is: don't be afraid to say what sucked.  The designer will be delighted to hear you had a good time, but he needs to know what needs to change more than he needs to know what was cool.  That said, don't be afraid to say what was cool, too.  Just don't skimp on the bad news.  The designer wants, craves, needs your bad news.  If he doesn't (I've been in one playtest where eeryone's negative feedback was ignored entirely, and that game came out notoriously unplayable), well, that game is about to die to inertia and groupthink anyway, and there's nothing you can do, so don't stress out.<br/><br/>Ask the designer if there's a particular dial setting or optional rule or setting option or whatever he'd like worked out, too.  Maybe it's just me, but I think that if ten groups of my friends playtested Dogs, everyone would go Once Upon a Time in China with their supernatural ("mighty with the power of righteousness!") and Baker would have no data about low-supernatural settings.

Isn't that a waste of your resources?<br/><br/>What I most value from playtesters as a designer is strong, opinionated questioning of my solutions. Those make me think and force me to either justify my solutions or discard them. There isn't much need for reasoning, even - just tell me which parts are suspect in my game, and you're already useful.<br/><br/>What I do when I playtest or otherwise critique games by others is active readership: I try to understand how to gain value from the game and how I should apply it to make it work. The theory is that this'll allow the designer to either accept or reject my interpretation. And if I should not be able to interpret the game fruitfully, then it wouldn't make much sense for me to test it anyway - I'm not in the target audience if I can't get interested in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208066/#Comment_208066" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T00:52:14+00:00" title="May 19, 2009 12:52AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2009 1:08AM by Wolfe.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a designer requesting playtests and readthroughs, (or even an author, when I wrote my NaNoWriMo novel) I welcome grammatical corrections, but I tell people not to stress about it, because<br/>\n<br/>\n1. It's quite likely that I may do a complete rewrite of the text anyway (not to change content necessarily, just to change the way I explain things; It's a part of how my mind works. Even when I'm "transcribing" my own work from one thing to another, I'll rewrite whole sections in the process of transcribing.)<br/>\n2. I'm almost certainly going to do a fine-tooth comb through of the text myself once it's complete, as well as request grammatical editing, so you're working on something that'll be done again, anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don't discourage it. Send me the grammatical fixes, I'll probably go through the text and fix them, even knowing I'll be undoing the work later. It satisfies the neurotic in me. At the very least, it'll mean that the parts I think work perfectly as they were originally written are thoroughly grammar-checked before it goes to publication.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a playtester, your primary focus should be on trying to break the game. Follow the rules, but try to use them in circumstances that the game may not be intended to handle. If the rules as intended (and just as importantly, *as written*) handle the situation, then they're solid, and the designer should be told so. When they fail (more likely in an early playtesting game) you need to let the designer know what failed, what you were trying to do with it, and why you believe it failed. It may end up that you misunderstood, but even misunderstandings are useful, in that they can point out areas where the text needs to be more clear. If you're conducting ongoing playtesting of a game in evolution (as opposed to a one-shot or short-run of a game with a single build of the ruleset) then you need to make a point to hit the changes as they come in. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think playtesters should attempt to use the rules exactly as written/intended, but when things break down, they should come up with their own solutions, and give that to the designer, as well. Stopping play of the game because some rules don't work is less useful than working through it. Now, obviously if the game is so broken that you're improvising solutions more often than you're playing with the rules, then that's different. <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, you should try to have fun. Yes, everyone says it, and it's true, that playtesting isn't about the fun. But that doesn't mean it *shouldn't* be fun. Rules that work consistently without errors, but still somehow miss the mark for fun are still a failure. If you don't have any fun, that's a big sign that things aren't working.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208068/#Comment_208068" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T00:56:33+00:00" title="May 19, 2009 12:56AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2009 1:08AM by Wolfe.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I hate my internet connection.

Lance, as far as I'm concerned if you keep playing after the game breaks that's cool and all, and I hope you find the fun in it, but it isn't going to be super helpful past the point of failure.<br/><br/>I really harp on the "it is more work than fun" angle, because I think that expectation should be set, but honestly I don't give stuff to people that is so undeveloped that I don't think it is playable.  I feel like someone who is gracious enough to take on something so haphazard as playtesting ought to be given a good chance of enjoying it.  Sometimes, though, there is pain and failure, and these are hugely valuable sessions.<br/><br/>Anyway Tom, my answer to your question:<br/><br/>1.  Address any specific concerns that were raised.  If the guy is worried about how a particular thing works, make sure you do that thing a few times under different conditions.<br/><br/>2.  Collect data.  I'm bad at this, but it is really useful.  How long did the session last?  How many scenes?  How many times did the clock get re-set?  Who moved a pawn when?  How much damage did the Cougar do?  Ask what metrics are most important and then record those.  There may be a couple of things that quantitative data will help iron out or illuminate.<br/><br/>3.  Every time you have a question about what to do next, note that.  <br/><br/>4.  Challenge assumptions and ask questions.  Don't be afraid to make suggestions or be critical.<br/><br/>That's the stuff that is helpful to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208074/#Comment_208074" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T05:00:13+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  5:00AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2009 6:18AM by Graham.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>As a playtester, your primary focus should be on trying to break the game</blockquote>\nI've heard this said, but it definitely isn't something I agree with.<br/><br/>As a playtester, ask the author what sort of playtesting they would like. Perhaps they want you to have fun with it, but tell you when the rules get in the way. Perhaps they want you to break it, looking hard for flaws. Perhaps they want you to play normally, but particularly concentrate on this one rule change.<br/><br/>Once, a playtester said "We'll stress test your game!". But that wasn't what I wanted. Personally, I've no interest in feedback from people who are concentrating on how to break the game mechanics. I want playtesters who concentrate on having fun, while considering how the rules are facilitating that fun (or not). If they're not having fun, I really want them to stop playtesting.<br/><br/>Then, sometimes, I'll have introduced a new rule. And I have no interest in knowing whether that rule breaks. Of course it'll break. I want them to treat it gently and report back on how it goes.<br/><br/>I'm generally uninterested in other people's suggestions of rules changes. I'd like people to tell me how something went wrong and I'll try and fix it. Like, one guy suggested that, in A Taste For Murder, it would be better if the detective could be murdered. Or someone else suggested that Forbidden City would be improved with the addition of stakes. I don't think so.<br/><br/>I <i>love</i> it when people record their playtests and give it to me.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings" title="Jon Hastings"><img alt="Jon Hastings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings">Jon Hastings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208077/#Comment_208077" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T06:23:37+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  6:23AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've playtested a few games and the designer usually wants to know what rules/systems we didn't use, so my advice would be: Pay attention to the rules you aren't using.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208079/#Comment_208079" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T06:39:45+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  6:39AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Graham on this one, any game can be broken...ANY game.<br/><br/>Here in Sydney, in the mid 90's, there was a group of players who regularly attended conventions as a team, their team name at every con was "Demolition". They weren't mean and vindictive, but they really knew how to push a game to it's limits. If the designer/GM resisted them, they'd instinctively find ways to absolutely demolish a game, whether this was through rules loopholes, pushing a story in directions the game creator hadn't wanted, or just whatever they thought was the most destructive.<br/><br/>If the designer was willing to have fun with them (and was willing to bend their ideals or bring new elements into the game within the context of the scenario and rules established so far), then things would be different. They'd push the envelope, whether the designer wanted the envelop pushed or not.<br/><br/>Some GMs/designers loved having these guys play their games because they'd really play at the extremes, and the sessions produced would be some of the most memorable and fun. Other GMs/designers dreaded seeing "Demolition" on their player rosters, for the exact same reasons.<br/><br/>I fell into the former group, and in one way this is the type of group I'd love to see playtest my games. As long as they had the right GM.<br/><br/>I've given up trying to design games for "realism" (which is probably why I'm hanging around here lately), everyone has a different sense of what's real. I try to design to bring about a certain style or sense of play. So a good playtesting group from my perspective would be able to go in blind with the rules and then generate the kind of game I had intended. <br/><br/>So I'd like a group that plays, then give me a decent debrief on their sessions.

They seem pretty alien to my own experiences, at least.  Alpha playtest drafts are basically notes to myself on what I should be doing when I present and facilitate the game.  Beta playtest drafts are notes to whoever's teaching and faciliating the game for other people (beta's the point where I hope other people run my games independently), but I generally assume that only one person out of the group has actually read the text, so the text is not really as important as getting the message across in whatever way you can.  But, then again, I'm pretty skeptical of texts in general (maybe why I've never written a "finished" text).<br/><br/>I also am against intentionally trying to break the game, unless the designer specifically wants that, but my games are also not perfectly balanced mechanical machines.  They are, generally speaking, flexible guidelines for crafting play experiences for your group.  If you break the game, well, that's probably going to mean playing it was less fun for you, so I'm not sure why you would intentionally want to do that.<br/><br/>In my mind, playtesters should treat drafts of games just like you would treat finished products, which means trying them out the way you would try out any other game: change the rules on the fly, change the setting, adjust dials, do whatever the hell you do with other games.  That's really the only way to get a sense of how users are ultimately going to use your end product. A lot of roleplaying groups don't play RPGs strictly by the rules, like a board game (And what does that mean, really?  Do you put money in the middle of the board when playing Monopoly?), and more often use rules texts as merely one of a number of components that they use to construct their play, along with, y'know, whatever other media they are consuming or have consumed in the past (books, movies, TV, comics, video games, other RPGs, etc.).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208096/#Comment_208096" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T08:19:13+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  8:19AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham,<br/>\n<br/>\nWe may simply have to agree to disagree, then. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don't make the game break, then the designer won't know where it breaks. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not talking about any crazy shit like not following the rules, or using the rules in ways that they're obviously (as in, stated) not to be used. That's stupid. I'm talking about trying things with the rules that the designer may not have considered when he wrote them, but that players might try to do with them. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don't want to know where the rules break, under reasonable circumstances, then you don't want your game playtested. You want people to tell you how great it is. <br/>\n<br/>\nJason,<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also not talking about playing a completely broken game. I'm pretty sure I said as much. I'm talking about when a particular rule doesn't seem to work, then you find a work around, and take note of it. As an example of this that can be referenced here on Story Games... There was an ambiguity in 3:16 where it didn't specify whether or not a player using a Strength in a PvP conflict could use it to wipe out the opposing player(s). I read through the rules, frowned a little bit, then saw something that, while not an answer, gave me what seemed like the spirit of the game, and I decided that yes, a Strength could be used to kill off opposing player characters. I brought it up and found out that Gregor, the game's creator, would have done it another way. This thing didn't completely break the game for me, so I found a work around. Later on, the exact same issue *did* break the game for Paul B. I made my own recommendation that the rules should be more clear on this being a dial for the players to set for themselves. Gregor stated that he didn't think it needed to be clearer. It was dropped (by me) as it's his game, his call. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, your point 2: Definitely something to emphasize, especially when you're seeking playtesting data.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208103/#Comment_208103" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T08:36:16+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  8:36AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess my rule zero (...) would be to ask what the guy you are helping out wants, because if nothing else this thread reveals a diversity of viewpoints in that regard.

In fact that's how I got started in actual for-pay writing for those nasty old trad publishers. Some thoughts on my approach, which seems to produce good feedback product for the designer/developer:<br/><br/>* Attempt to play the game in precisely the spirit the designer intended. Really, really embrace what he's going for. And when the rules or text or procedures get in the way of that spirit, make a note.<br/><br/>* Nod to Ralph for explicating it: If you ever, ever reach a point in any procedure at any point where you don't know what to do next -- where it's not absolutely clear -- make a note. Use a big font and a bright color. It's probably the most important issue you can identify.<br/><br/>* Challenge the designer if your gut says something is fussy, or you don't understand the point of the rule, or if it's producing unhappiness. Offer alternatives, mostly so the designer can explain why the alternative doesn't work (and therefore solidify in his own mind what it is he DOES want to accomplish). As a playtester, don't advocate strongly for your alternative; just present it as a discussion starter.<br/><br/>* Pay attention to handling time. I like seeing games with one or two keystone mechanics, points at which the action slows down. Players tend to get invested in those moments. But if the whole game is paced out the same way -- it's all quick resolution, or slow resolution -- that's a problem. That's a very, very common problem in game design and it's hard to eyeball as the designer.<br/><br/>* I very much differentiate different stages of playtest. There's the alpha test, which is the very broad "is the premise appealing and does the general shape of play support the premise" stage. Then there's the beta phase, where you might introduce a few variant rules and pay attention to the actual at-the-table output. Then there's also just the reading phase, which is more about testing the document for usability and form factor. IMO playtesters need to know what phase they're in so they spend their energies appropriately.<br/><br/>* At some point during a late-stage beta, <i>play to the end of the game</i>. These folks who haven't actually seen their own game's entire arc in action, I have no patience for them. And if you don't think your game has an "end," think again: even if you don't have victory conditions, under what circumstances do the players call it quits? Why? Is it a satisfactory ending or does the game abandon the players in long-term play? The only games that don't have "ends" are the ones that are actually played until you die. Nobody's published that one yet.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208118/#Comment_208118" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T10:15:19+00:00" title="May 19, 2009 10:15AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>How is that reasonable, Jason, if the text you're playtesting from will be rewritten for actual publication?

It's been damned near impossible to get people to give me any sort of feedback, and now I'm being shown that the types of feedback people are wont to give are likely to be less than completely useful to me. (which isn't to say I wouldn't take it; I'll make some sort of use of any feedback I can get, but what I truly want is what I pointed out as best practices for playtesting).<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul B,<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of what you say falls squarely in what I was trying to convey. There's a term that I kept trying to remember but couldn't, so I simply settled for "try to break the game". Now that I'm back in my room, I'll get the book so maybe I can be more clear. <br/>\n<br/>\nAh ha. Fully exercise. It's a programming term, used for testing a program to make sure it works. In coding terms, it involves testing a variety of input values, focusing on boundary values, where a value difference one way or the other will cause a different behavior from the program. Typical integer values include -1, 0,1, and illegal values such as a character instead of an integer, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I mean when I talk about trying to break the game is the playtesting equivalent of "fully exercising". I think every rule needs to be tested under a variety of possible situations. Likewise, if the designer knows up front that a rule doesn't do a particular thing, and that's either by design or something he deems acceptable, then he should be clear about that.. Basically, the playtesting equivalent of "Preconditions", agreements up front of what inputs are acceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this change anything, or did people understand what I was trying to convey already?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I don't like to think of myself as a bully. I prefer to think of it more like bodybuilding.

Will your customers play to break the game? No. They'll play to enjoy themselves. So, by playtesting to break the game, you are failing to replicate the conditions under which it will eventually be played. You are playing with a completely different intention from any genuine player. If you are playtesting to break the game, you are massaging your own testosterone-fuelled ego rather than helping the designer.<br/><br/>Playing to enjoy yourself is best practice for playtesting and the only valid way of doing so. Play to enjoy yourself, but note when things go wrong.

They weren't mean and vindictive, but they really knew how to push a game to it's limits. If the designer/GM resisted them, they'd instinctively find ways to absolutely demolish a game, whether this was through rules loopholes, pushing a story in directions the game creator hadn't wanted, or just whatever they thought was the most destructive.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Some GMs/designers loved having these guys play their games because they'd really play at the extremes, and the sessions produced would be some of the most memorable and fun. Other GMs/designers dreaded seeing "Demolition" on their player rosters, for the exact same reasons.</blockquote>The latter GMs were great big girlie men. Frankly, Demolition weren't that bad, they just had a low tolerance for being bored and a high degree of inventiveness when it came to solving boredom. A more intimidating team would be something like Philippa Borland, Fred Munier, and Jyan Delamotte - three people with a combined gaming experience of five decades (then; more now), very intelligent, and possessed of enough willpower to do whatever the heck they wanted.<br/><br/>Anyway, breaking games. I don't think it's useful to push games to extremes to see if they'll break. <i>Any</i> game can break; plenty of people on RPGnet striving to demonstrate a game's brokeness is proof enough of that. But if a game only breaks in situations that never come up in actual play... who gives a damn? Just because it's easily mathematically possible to create a Wild Talents character with the power to kill entire cities without even rolling dice, doesn't mean that such a PC will ever enter a single game.<br/><br/>Instead, I'd rather focus on whether a game breaks during the kind of play that it's supposed to support.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208264/#Comment_208264" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T04:24:40+00:00" title="May 20, 2009  4:24AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run many, many playtests. The playtests we run are usually for the target audience for the game, who are not games designers. I'm sure there's another kind of playtesting which could be useful, that is experienced designers trying your game and giving feedback. That is not the feedback we want, though.<br/><br/>Playtesters are there to play the game with the actual rules as they create actual play, and give us feedback on whether they enjoyed the game or adventure. We don't want to know whether it might not work for "less experienced gamers" just whether it would work for them.  We want them to play the rules as written and not change them. If the rules don't handle a particular situation well which naturally occurs in actual play, we need to know. When we say actual play, we mean what's happening at the table rather than what's happening the fiction. The last thing we want is people offering design suggestions for the problems they encounter, or, even worse, problems they think they or others might encounter. <br/><br/>We prefer separate, independent feedback from the GM and the players, if that's possible. In Esoterrorists, for example, in three playtests, the GM's told us they had to improvise like mad as the players moved away from the written adventure, and in those same games, a couple of the players said that the adventure seemed railroaded. Conversely, when the GM followed the structure of the adventure fairly strictly in other cases, there was no such feedback.<br/><br/>We want multiple groups, not in contact with each other, giving independent feedback.<br/><br/>We are happy to have grammar and typo feedback, or comments on the text. We like suggestions for new sections or better explanatory material.<br/><br/>Occasionally, writers and publishers disagree what constitutes useful feedback.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208272/#Comment_208272" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T06:40:31+00:00" title="May 20, 2009  6:40AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: simjames</cite>The latter GMs were great big girlie men.

The events of that session really showed me where the game needed some structural reinforcement, and a couple of areas where the rules seemed to hinder the flow I had been hoping for. This was one of the most educational playtests I've ever been a part of, because the players instantly got the style of game I was hoping for and they played this style of game to it's limits, with an enthusiasm which is just wrong on the fourth morning of a con.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208278/#Comment_208278" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T07:28:38+00:00" title="May 20, 2009  7:28AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James,<br/>\n<br/>\nWho gives a damn?

I already know that the rules do what I want them to do. I'm probably not going to change the game much based on playtest reports.<br/><br/>But, having created the game, I know the rules backwards and forwards. I didn't have to read the text to learn them. My primary desire in having my games playtested is to find out how well the text does in conveying the rules. All the internal playtesting in the world I can do is not going to help in that regard.<br/><br/>For example, without the aid of one of my playtesters, I might have never realized that in <i>Chronica Feudalis</i>, I explained how to get Injuries and heal Injuries, but I never explained what you <i>do</i> with Injuries.<br/><br/>So, make note of any time you have a question about the text. Even if you eventually find the answer in the rules, it can help designers make sure the presentation is intuitive and easily referenced.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208311/#Comment_208311" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T10:50:36+00:00" title="May 20, 2009 10:50AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2009 1:19PM by timfire.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my obligatory playtesting rant:\n<blockquote><cite>timfire's playtesting rant</cite>It's important to recognize that there are two stages of playtesting: I call them "alpha" and "beta", but you can call them whatever you want.<br/><br/>The "alpha" stage is about testing whether or not the game---or more specifically, the rules &amp; mechanics---work as intended. Since a game in the "alpha" stage will likely change, I think that it's better for the designer to keep the text simple, just write down the bare bones of what's necessarily to play.<br/><br/>The "beta" stage comes after the designer is confident that the game works as intended (more or less), and is about figuring out how to best communicate the game. In this sense, it's more about refining advice and play techniques, rather than "rules" and mechanics. In this stage, the text should be maybe 80% written.<br/><br/>Another issue is that the designer needs not only playtests that are personally overseen and/or guided, they also need playtests that are conducted completely independently. It makes sense that the "alpha" stage will likely involve much more of the former (personally overseen and/or guided), since the design will likely still be in a state of flex. But the "beta" stage pretty much requires the latter (independently conducted).<br/><br/>New designers tends to focus heavily on the "alpha" stage, but neglect or otherwise rush the "beta" stage. Don't do that. The "beta" stage needs just as much time and attention as the "alpha" stage, if not more.</blockquote>\nAs you can probably guess, my advice to playtesters depends on which stage of development the game is in.<br/><br/>In what I call the "alpha" stage, I think it's important to really test out the rules. Explore the edges and look for holes. There should be a definite "playtesting" mindset. If you're going to try to purposely break the game, this is the time to try, though I don't think that's something all playtesters should worry about. Don't pay the text much mind, though, unless something is really unclear. During this stage, it would probably be good to ask the designer if there's anything they want testers to look out for, focus on, or experiment with.<br/><br/>"Beta" testing should be approached more like a normal game. I'm not sure if there's anything in particular a "beta" tester should do, other than to take the time to go over the text and really critique it. Are the rules clear? Is there a logical and understandable flow? How well does it read in general? How's grammar and spelling?... Hmm, I guess it's also important for "beta" testers to really pay attention to the types of techniques they use in pay, and their effects, particularly if they're bringing in those techniques from outside the text.<br/><br/>And that brings up the one piece of personal advice I have. Playtesters need to be very mindful of "reading into" the instructions. This is important for both stages, but it's particularly significant for "beta" testers. It doesn't matter if you're doing what was intended, the designer needs to know if something is unclear, or if you were adding your own techniques. Just take note of it and discuss it with the designer later.<br/><br/>An issue I had with <i>The Mountain Witch</i> is that even though the game got plenty of playtesting, the testers were all Forgies who automatically "got" how to implement certain techniques. I thought I was golden, but when the game got released to the wider world, there were a couple of common questions people kept approaching me with. I think this issue is much more difficult to deal with than it sounds, since experienced players will internalize certain techniques, such that it just becomes "how they play".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208346/#Comment_208346" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T13:40:18+00:00" title="May 20, 2009  1:40PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tim,<br/>\n<br/>\nI was actually thinking much the same thing (phases) when I was thinking about this discussion earlier. Graham's points about other things in playtesting being useful is also something I can't disagree with. I wasn't saying that breaking the game is the sole focus, I just think it should be the main focus (wait for it) in *early* playtesting. That's where my head's at right now, so that's where all of my thinking is at. I concede the value of the other stuff, but it's less useful to me than the breaking stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Tim is calling Beta playtesting, for a TTRPG, is something that I find difficult to call playtesting. I'd call it polishing. Making sure the text works to explain the game clearly is less about testing play and more about testing explanation. Seeing the game work well can be useful in reassuring you that it does what it's supposed to, that it produces the right effects, consistently. At this point in the game, you're not going to be changing much of the rules at all, just a small tweak here and there. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I guess it's less a matter of difference of technique, overall, as we differ in what we think of as playtesting. <br/>\n<br/>\n"I think this issue is much more difficult to deal with than it sounds, since experienced players will internalize certain techniques, such that it just becomes "how they play"."<br/>\n<br/>\nThat, right there, is gold, no matter what you're doing though.

At this point in the game, you're not going to be changing much of the rules at all, just a small tweak here and there.</blockquote>\nI don't know, Wolfe, you might be falling into a classic trap there.<br/><br/>What I call "beta" testing is MUCH more than just "polishing". While I say that a "beta" test should be "approached more like a normal game", that doesn't mean that a "beta" test IS a normal game. Coming out of the "alpha" stage, a game will still likely contain holes and other minor things that only come to light when exposed to different play styles or particular circumstances. The indie scene is littered with games that work perfectly well under the guidance of the designer or within a particular circle of friends, but fall apart when the game is played in the wider world.<br/><br/>Furthermore, while the "hard" rules may get worked out in the "alpha" stage, the "soft" techniques and advice---the things that really make a game work consistently and shine---tend to only get hashed out in "beta" stage. I mean, the "soft" techniques are often dependent on the "hard" rules, so you often can't even begin working on the "soft" techniques until later in the playtesting process. In that sense, a "beta" game is NOT complete, even if the "hard" rules don't change. The actual <i>game</i> will continue to evolve throughout the "beta" stage.<br/><br/>For example, the idea of (the techniques that is now called) "Fishing" was a product of "beta" testing <i>The Mountain Witch</i>.<br/><br/>There's also this perception that the rules of a game are separate from the "explanation" of the text. I used to think that way myself, but now I view the "explanation" as a crucial component of the overall "game". I can list more than one game that features a fully functional rule-set, but has a text that's so mangled that no one can figure out how to play.<br/><br/>It's easy to under value the work that gets done in the "beta" stage, and it inevitably leads to "half-baked" games. This was the big lesson of '05-'06, when a whole batch of designers rushed what were effectively "alpha" games to print.<br/><br/>PS---This post kinda turned into "timfire's obligatory playtesting rant, part 2".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208383/#Comment_208383" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T15:26:51+00:00" title="May 20, 2009  3:26PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2009 3:28PM by timfire.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oops, double post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208393/#Comment_208393" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T16:30:02+00:00" title="May 20, 2009  4:30PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a game consumer, I'd just like to give Tim a big thumbs up for those posts, especially about beta playtesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
