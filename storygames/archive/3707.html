I think I'll be building it around James West's <a href="http://www.randomordercreations.com/thepool.htm" rel="nofollow">The Pool</a>, since it is simple and has been thoroughly play-tested.<br/><br/>However, there is one significant problem: the dice. Not that I think there is anything wrong with the mechanics, it just uses too many of them for the purposes of an intro game. I don't think average people keep twenty to thirty d6's on hand, which is a major obstacle for the game being ready-to-go after a single read-through.<br/><br/>Decks of playing cards are ubiquitous, though. Here's what I came up with after some idle shuffling. In the following, "face-down" means the value of the card is unknown even to the person who draws it from the deck:<br/><br/>When a conflict comes up, the GM draws 1-3 cards from the deck and plays them face-down on the table.<br/><br/>The player then draws one card and plays it face-up.<br/><br/>If the player's character has a relevent Talent, they draw and place a second card face-down.<br/><br/>The player may then spend points from their Pool to draw further cards and play them face-down, one point per card. <br/><br/>Both player and GM flip over their face-down cards. The player wins if their highest value card beats the GM's highest value card, and things lead on to the Monologue of Victory or Pool increase as per the original rules.<br/><br/>I play it that face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are all worth 5 (giving a semi-bell-curve to possible results). I'm tempted to engineer some special bonus to them, but that may be unduly complicated and random. Haven't figured what to do with Jokers, but it always bugs me when a game calls for removal of certain cards from the deck, so I'd like to come up with a use for them.<br/><br/>Hows this look?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83183/#Comment_83183" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T09:37:49+00:00" title="July 25, 2007  9:37AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, that's ... crazed.<br/><br/>Look. here's how you do the Pool with a deck of playing cards:<br/><br/>Instead of "rolling" you draw a card.<br/><br/>A king or a face card indicates a success.

I used standard Chessex 12mm d6's, and rolled them five at a time aprox. fifty times. More often than not (<i>significantly</i> more often than not, actually) this resulted in at least ond die coming up 1 per roll, a success.<br/><br/>I did much the same with the cards, drawing five at a time till I ran through the deck then reshuffling. More often than not, each set resulted in a failure.<br/><br/>At a guess, I imagine the problem is that I wasn't reshuffling the deck before each draw. This was by deliberate choice, because I think its an extra step that would discourage a novice. One of the reasons I originally had the card resolution as "the player's draw has to  beat the GM's draw" was because (I think; I'm no statician) the probabilities remained more stable. Thinking on it, I'm tempted to go back to the original method. Despite Ben's shocked comment, it really isn't complicated, no more so than a hand of poker, and it worked fine when I tested it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83455/#Comment_83455" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T10:31:32+00:00" title="July 26, 2007 10:31AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 26, 2007 10:31AM by Ben_Lehman.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, seriously, if you are throwing down dice more often than twice a scene in the pool you have big trouble.<br/><br/>Odds of rolling at least one one on 5 evenly-weighted dice: %60<br/>Odds of drawing at least one ace or king card from an evenly shuffled deck: %50<br/><br/>The difference gets lesser the more cards you draw.

When you create a character, you assign bonus (pluses) to your Traits by spending dice from the "starting pool." So your actual starting pool is usually between 3 and 5 dice.<br/><br/>And also, people are accustomed to sharing a deck of cards when they play card games. So probably all you need is one deck of cards. When a conflict comes up, you figure out how many cards you get from Traits, and how many you're spending from your pool (which you track as a number, rather than as a handful of cards) and the GM deals you that many cards. And then he deals you 1 to 3 bonus cards.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
