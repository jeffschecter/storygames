The "return to the normal world, bringing change" is very much in line with the alleged "Hero's Journey". (The validity of it as a universal source of myth and story is something I think is at least up for debate, but that's for elsewhere.)<br/><br/>That being said, if we're talking about the "reader" (or in this case, the player), a lot of roleplaying games can indeed enable such a return, at least in the ones that are very involving in some way. You play the game, have an impactful session, and then return to your regular mundane life, having picked something up from the game. In fact, that's technically one of the major points of "bleed": you experience something in the session that you then take back out of the game and into your normal life. A lot of American-based games are just non-specific and not explicit about the concept.<br/><br/>Still, even D&amp;D has this effect. Players have memorable experiences in the game, and they bring those experiences back out into their normal lives in some fashion.<br/><br/>If we're talking about letting the <i>characters</i> return to familiarity with change, I'd argue that it's a stylistic choice that many RPGs <i>don't</i> enable this. It's because, in a story, a lot of people <b>like</b> to see characters move on into new situations. You find new digs, new circles, new ways to see life. That being said, Apocalypse World absolutely does this: since it centers around a community, you're constantly returning to your community as a source of familiarity--it's a home base.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422206/#Comment_422206" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-30T11:43:14+00:00" title="September 30, 2013 11:43AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You level up tho.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422216/#Comment_422216" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-30T15:10:31+00:00" title="September 30, 2013  3:10PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is less useful then I had hoped.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AaronF" title="AaronF"><img alt="AaronF" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nNH2FYNIYUOC3.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AaronF">AaronF</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422217/#Comment_422217" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-30T15:14:00+00:00" title="September 30, 2013  3:14PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2013 3:15PM by AaronF.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That story circle seems great for a particular kind of story, one focused on a single character (or sometimes a few). A lot of RPG stories are not really about the characters, they're about solving the problem, e.g. saving mom/the town/the world, or getting what the characters want, e.g. fame/riches/xp. In these kinds of stories most of the steps in that diagram are optional. In fact everything but 2 and 3, which are requisite of most stories anyway.<br/><br/>So why don't RPG stories follow through with 7 and 8? Most haven't laid the groundwork for that, and aren't going that direction. Even if they have, the story usually wraps up around 5 or 6 (perhaps skipping back to 1 with an implied 7 and 8, perhaps not). Of course, that's generally up to the table, and sometimes the return and showing the changes in (all of) the characters can be done to great effect. Other times it's superfluous or not applicable.<br/><br/>Example: Fiasco. This is ostensibly focused on the characters! But what happens in most games regarding this story circle? Everyone starts with needs, so 1-2 might be discussed during set-up but scenes usually start with 3 "entering an unfamiliar situation." Now all these characters have powerful ambition, and we don't have enough scenes anyway, for them to adapt to a situation much, so 4 is entirely optional and likely to get glossed over. The second act is all about number 6 "pay a heavy price" - whether they actually get what they want (number 5) is a crapshoot, and may not happen for anybody at all! Once we find out who got what they wanted and who didn't, the scenes are over. So, the aftermath - a lot of ways to go with this. Whether you got what you wanted or not, you CAN use the aftermath to show 7 and 8, returning to regular life having changed. But more often in my experience, players choose to show 6, showing the heavy price they paid (or extending it if it was already shown). Others go with 5 - they finally get what they want after all, or 4, they got screwed but end up adjusting and carrying on. Sometimes, the character hasn't changed at all, or their previous familiar situation has been obliterated. And importantly, in most cases all the characters had a satisfying ending anyway.<br/><br/>That story circle is great for some kinds of stories (centered around 1 or a few characters, especially in a repeating cycle like TV). I just don't think most RPGs are aiming for that kind of story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422240/#Comment_422240" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-01T08:57:05+00:00" title="October  1, 2013  8:57AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah; a lot of games are progressive, not cyclical, developing new and different motifs instead of settling into familiar patterns.

Most games have mechanical advancements and that kind of progression doesn't really enforce any cyclical thinking. Also, the most accepted idea of one person (the game master) controlling the story really don't fit this kind of thinking.<br/><br/><a href="http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Dan_Harmon" rel="nofollow">More reading about the story circle</a>.

My first reaction is to look at how the world outside of the PCs often has little meaning outside how it impacts the PCs themselves.  So while the "having changed" thing can happen, there's no real impact on the "familiar situation" - because the "familiar situation" never meant anything except a stage for the PC to do stuff in the first place. For this cycle to work, the readers (players, in RPGs) have to be invested (and have a reason to be invested) in something more than just the character (their PC). In RPGs, that can be both emotionally unfamiliar and practically difficult to accomplish. Every RPG includes character creation as a readily visible, understandable and relate-able feature. Few include "situation creation" as anything other than a hidden, implied consequence. Even fewer do anything to help make the advancement/alteration/evolution of the situation relate-able. I mean, it surely CAN happen; "with a good GM", "when everyone gets it right", "if we get lucky." Some help might be nice, though ...<br/><br/>But I'd be able to focus that a bit better if I knew more about what you were hoping for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422248/#Comment_422248" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-01T11:56:03+00:00" title="October  1, 2013 11:56AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess you could argue that Dogs in the Vineyard does this: when a Dog retires, having paid a heavy price in their duties, they try to return to their community, having changed.

But that bit about the denouement makes sense. A typical dungeon crawl ends when the party gets the loot and gets out, for example. Any "return to the familiar" or "Change" is more of level-up/adjust your character sheet. There's rarely a scene back at the tavern where the party sits around talking, then someone makes a lame joke aaaaannd -Freeze Frame; roll credits. <br/><br/>The denouement is mostly meta-game stuff. The <i>players </i> wrap up, with maybe a few words from the GM concerning loose ends. But (for me) that was back in the days of episodic module-type adventures. We moved on to more leap-frog, multiple story arcs; closer to a soap opera formula. Not much room for a tidy wrap-up.<br/><br/>It makes me wonder: "what in-game function a denouement might have?" Could it be linked to something other than leveling up? I suppose you could take the time to discuss what you liked about the session; what you would like to see return or see more of. Realistically, we're often too tired (or, yes, too drunk) for that to be practical but I'd like to hear what the tea-totalers do.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422270/#Comment_422270" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-01T17:08:22+00:00" title="October  1, 2013  5:08PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The medium lends itself to more action sequences than, say, movies and books.

When you decide that it's time for the character to retire from adventuring, you total up experience points and wealth and roll some dice, and you find out whether the character a) achieves this goal, and b) whether the goal is what the character expected or hoped.<br/><br/>Is that kind of halfway there?<br/><br/>It's true that no game I'm familiar with deals extensively with the "return home" and the denouement. It probably has something to do with that being the least exciting part of the story + our focus in game design on conflicts, danger, and combat, as opposed to, say, healing, nurturing, and building up things for future relationships.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422286/#Comment_422286" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-01T21:48:41+00:00" title="October  1, 2013  9:48PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2013 3:27AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it <i>is</i> the lack of denouement, then yeah, I agree -- it rarely gets played out in the groups I've been in. Sometimes there'll be a kind of narrated epilogue to wrap up the story and sometimes we'll talk about it out-of-character and out-of-game, but mostly we just move on to the next story or to the next game.<br/><br/>Funny thing, though: I <i>always</i> imagine a denouement for the characters I play after the game is done. If we killed the dragon and took its loot and ended the game there, I'll still figure out what my character is going to spend his share on, and what his life post-dragonslaying is going to look like. If we failed to avert the zombie apocalypse and the last medical facility burns to the ground, I know where my character will hopelessly trudge toward next and what his state of mind will be. We save the girl my character likes, I know what kind of relationship he'll try to build with her. I'm positively <i>crazy</i> for denouement: I just don't push for it in group play, and I don't feel like I really <i>need</i> to play it out in a group.* I sort of feel like Paul_T is right in that game systems typically focus on conflicts, danger, and excitement, and it's just difficult to make the "return home" into something that can engage and delight an entire table full of people.<br/><br/>* edit: actually, the more I think about it, the more I think playing it out with a group would ruin it for me.<br/><br/><br/>(I vaguely remember someone talking about post-game denouements a while back, but I can't find the thread. Something about how he'd run a game, get it to a good ending point, and then find out later on that his players were sneaking around afterwards making up "what happened afterwards" stories about their characters. I was all, "Hey, I do that, too!" and got a chuckle out of it.

See the thread about the multiple intelligence idea. So we can get some great inspiration from it, but I wouldn't expect it to apply to or be found in every RPG.<br/><br/>Now, the denoument question itself--that's a very interesting one on its own, not taking the Campbellian model into account.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422306/#Comment_422306" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T09:34:23+00:00" title="October  2, 2013  9:34AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the monomyth is blown out of proportion, and Campbell was kind of an intellectual conman. That said, though, it's not incorrect to notice that most narratives have a structures that can be discerned and often seem to follow the same patterns.<br/><br/>Boiled down, the Harmon thing is basically:<br/><br/>Here's the hero, in daily life<br/>Something happens! Hero has to deal with it.<br/>Doing so exposes the dark side of live as the hero knew it.<br/>Situation gets dealt with, one way or another (losing is possible). Life finds a new kind of normal, but the hero is not the same person anymore.<br/><br/>That covers a lot of story-telling. If we accept the idea of a less literal homecoming, the "return to the world" thing is pretty important to most stories. I mean, obviously, the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> does this explicitly, but you can see the same structure in, say, <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>. (<i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> sort of does it, although I'd argue it's about becoming unmoored in a world that itself changes, which complicates the picture.)<br/><br/>Even less epic, less deliberately myth-making, and shorter works do this: in "A Small Good Thing" (the longer version, not the one from <i>What We Talk About When We Talk About Love</i>), the parents have a normal life. Their kid gets hit by a car. They deal with grief. Their relationship strains. Someone keeps calling their house asking about their kid. Finally, the boy dies, and they find out the baker they hired to bake his birthday cake is the one who's been calling. They go to meet him in the middle of the night, he realizes his terrible mistake, and consoles them. Life starts again, but changed.<br/><br/>How you do this in a RPG...is trickier. In my <i>Masks</i> campaign, I'm going to emphatically require the players to think about it, and have a real coda after everything plays out where they return to the world, utterly changed by their experience. And I may even pull it off!<br/><br/>Building a mechanic around this, or a game, would be a very interesting challenge. I'm going to have to think about this. How do you design a system so that it gives weight to the conclusion?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422307/#Comment_422307" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T10:37:18+00:00" title="October  2, 2013 10:37AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2013 10:37AM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One way is to have the conclusion as a sort of endgame, an explicit goal. Brian Engard's <i>Becoming RPG</i> pits a single Hero against the Fates who bid and bargain to corrupt the Hero; the Endgame is where you tally everything up, and somebody gets to deliver an epilogue. Everyone knows that's what it's gunning towards.<br/><br/>Ben Robbins' <i>Kingdom</i> has countdown "time bombs" in the form of the Crossroads and the Crisis. When they reach the end of the track, something happens. This can often make for an excellent conclusion, as it did with a session I played.<br/><br/>The main trick seems to be to remove some of the open-endedness from the game. Establish that there will be a specific conclusion, and then advance the onset of that conclusion, as you try to figure out what the conclusion will look like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422318/#Comment_422318" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T12:23:34+00:00" title="October  2, 2013 12:23PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finales are hard. "Breaking Bad" did it about as well as possible and even that will have its critics. So making that part of the process...yeah. <br/><br/>The two examples you gave seem to use a mechanic to ramp up the tension. This makes sense. I was reading an article on GMing today and the author made some good points about the different ways that tension is created/maintained in RPGs vs other media (essentially, authors can arrange events and reactions to create tension, whereas in an RPG there will usually be some random chance plus the need to keep structures open-ended.)<br/><br/>Theoretically you could do this in systems without such a mechanism. It probably comes down to stakes; most games don't do stakes-setting that well (or the published settings/adventures don't, which works out about the same.) You really can't have a conclusion until you know the question it would answer.<br/><br/>Meant to also note: there are examples where the setting changes as well. Take the conclusion to "Buffy", which breaks one of the key  rules of the setting. And in that example, Buffy hasn't even changed...well, not that much. But. The main question of her character has been answered, i.e., how can I have something like a normal life when I have this enormous responsibility on my head?<br/><br/>I'm thinking that finding the questions is going to be the key.

Yes, some films have more action in them. These generally externalize the conflict, but in all the compelling action stories, the external conflict is symbolic of the point. The monsters that the hero fights are symbolic of non-physical challenges. Such stories require more understanding of symbolism in order to fathom than some. <br/><br/>As I see it, Raiders of the Lost Ark is all about putting one's faith in the divine. This is repeated throughout the film in nearly every scene. Indy starts out a skeptic - he scoffs at the local's superstitions (this is repeatedly emphasized in the jungle, and he later repeats it to his class at the university). We see this symbolically as he tries to substitute a bag a sand for a holy idol, which ends poorly. This comes up over and over. The climax is particularly notable because it breaks so far from tradition. The hero doesn't defeat the villains at all - he chooses to surrender, is tied up, and then closes his eyes. The Indy who does this is unquestionably a different Indy from the one in the beginning, in my opinion. <br/><br/>And here's a key point - many people wouldn't be able to articulate this symbolism, yet despite that, I think it is responsible for the power of the story. I do not think that Raiders of the Lost Ark would be more compelling if this point was made more overtly - such as by a narrator talking about the importance of faith or somesuch. \n<blockquote>Laws has observed that RPGs have been strongly procedural since their inception.

Given our opposed analyses of Raiders, though, I suspect that we're seeing different things. I suspect you might look at one of my old GURPS games and think that it was all just about procedure. <br/><br/>One of the common problems I have with recent story games is that they are unwilling to allow for or trust in symbolism. Instead, the attitude seems to always be for making things more overt - like having stats for relationships or stats like "With Love" or "Self-Loathing". In a story game of Raiders, the attitude might be "unless you have a 'faith in the divine' stat, then your story isn't about faith in the divine".  \n<blockquote>I guess what I'm saying (besides working through my churn of feelings) is, to what extent can you have procedural and dramatic storytelling working together, and how can you facilitate it?

Trying to be too analytic about it doesn't necessarily help, and definitely trying to explain those analyses doesn't necessarily help.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422378/#Comment_422378" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-03T12:10:21+00:00" title="October  3, 2013 12:10PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, theory burned me out of grad school, so I'm with you to a point about that. <br/><br/>Your analysis of "Raiders" is very interesting. I'm thinking about it. I'm initially sympathetic to it, but I want to think about it for a bit.<br/><br/>Your point about the externalization of conflict in for purposes of consistency I'll call "procedural" stories is well-put and can't be said enough, frankly. However, it's clear that sometimes you get both--shows built on dramatic relationships, where the externalized conflicts reinforce the internalized ones--obviously, "Buffy" is a sterling example of this. "Burn Notice" was less so, except that most of the "mark of the week" plots served to reinforce the idea that Michael can't be the good person his friends see and pursue a life in covert ops.<br/><br/>Symbolism is a tricky thing, and deploying it in an RPG presents a lot of problems, starting with, "what if nobody sees it but you?"

I don't consider it important if no one sees it - the point is in how it is felt rather than in whether it is recognized. I consider symbolism a success if people think that it was a good, compelling game and don't notice the symbolism. Free use of the imagination almost always creates symbolism, so it often isn't recognized even by the author. <br/><br/>I just used GURPS as a random example - probably because I recently joined in a GURPS game - but I don't especially like the system. My favorites do include James Bond 007 and Hero System, though. I started play in 3rd grade in 1977, having learned about D&amp;D from my preschool friend's older brother. \n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/jhkim">@jhkim</a>: I think you misunderstood what Laws means with "drama".</blockquote>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> - Can you say more about that?

(I don't know "Barney's Case".) They both include a fair bit of action along with romance and dialogue. <br/><br/>2) As I would put it, Indy's has really changed as a person over the course of the movie. The difference from some other movies is how his internal struggles are communicated to the audience. In a talk-heavy movie, those internal struggles are externalized into dialogue and monologue. In a musical, those internal struggles are often externalized into songs. In an action movie, those internal struggles are often externalized into physical action. <br/><br/>From my view, the important thing is that you don't need to be an academic studying Bakhtin to do this - any more than you need to be a chemist to make good food, nor does knowing the chemistry of sugars and starches necessarily make you a better cook. Drama is the normal result of people making up stories. Someone who just reaches into their imagination to tell a story, will come up with a narrative that has dramatic development.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422396/#Comment_422396" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-03T17:25:34+00:00" title="October  3, 2013  5:25PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2013 5:26PM by Aviatrix.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About 1) I'm going to hold off a bit, because I'd like to hear more...<br/><br/>...about 2): could you elucidate what you see as the changes Indy undergoes?

It's the thing I hated most about grad school (so of course that's what I ended up doing my thesis one, alas.)

Bear in mind the vagaries/necessities of a Hollywood production; in particular: the second movie actually was a prequel but we (the audience) are seeing Indy for the second time and expect more from him. So -<br/><br/>At the beginning of Raiders, Indy is stealing a native artifact because he thinks "it belongs in a museum". At the end of the second movie he is <i>returning </i> a native artifact to its tribe. Yes, chronologically out of order to character growth but to the audience Indy has grown.<br/><br/>The third movie shows Indy connecting with the only family he knows; his father. In a flash back, we see the distance between them and the obsession both have for artifacts. By the end of the movie, his father has let the Grail go and urges Indy to do the same, and the connection between them is cemented.<br/><br/>By the fourth movie, Dr. Jones senior is dead and the Son becomes the Father. The care-free adventurer becomes the family man and connects to HIS son (but, of course, isn't quite willing to pass on the torch/hat just yet). A single line brings this home: "This is intolerable!". When Indie says his father's catch phrase, we see the connection between generations.<br/><br/>Okay, so not exactly <i>To Kill A Mockingbird</i> (and don't be dissing Atticus or you're gonna start a flame war!) but not bad for an RPG character over the course of a few action adventures.<br/><br/>So, what can we take from this? One thing I've noticed (and utilized) is the use of self-reference with-in a story; that is to say, taking something from the past and bringing it up again, and shining a new light on it. It creates a connection from past events to present. And it can high-light character change/growth. It can give substance to an otherwise seemingly random series of events. It's why "you can't go home again", because even though home may not have changed, you have.<br/><br/>How you can incorporate this into your game is system specific. But I think this is a case where the mechanics of <i>any </i> game might reflect the fiction (instead of vice-versa). Something your character does changes their character sheet and there-by changes the way they interact with the world. If your barbarian gives up his Barbarian Rage for some sort of Diplomacy advantage - well, either that's a story worth hearing or you're the WORST min-maxer ever. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422401/#Comment_422401" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-03T19:22:43+00:00" title="October  3, 2013  7:22PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Biffboff">@Biffboff</a>: Yeah, you can take the Literature degree out of the girl...wait, the girl out of the...crap. Look, analysis is a transferable skill; the stuff I learned reading texts is what let me learn how to program databases. That said, I don't get much of a chance to use the original skill set in public; now you know why.<br/><br/>I like your arc there for Indy; I see it more; if John wants to jump back, though, I'm still interested in his insight.<br/><br/>The calling back is huge as you say. It's the metaphorical <i>home</i> that the "hero" has left. I hadn't thought about that comparison between the first and second movies, but it's a really good example.<br/><br/>Point also taken about mechanics. In fact, I did something similar just last weekend. I was playing Lady Blackbird (the game and the character) and I ended up buying off all my keys. The first time was narrative--on the spur of the moment, after sharing a moment of intimacy with Vance, the Lady told him her name. I looked down on my sheet and said, "I think I just bought off a Key." The other two were more deliberate, with me angling both towards an arc where Natasha would be completely changed, and the practical need to make two desperate plays to save the crew. Still, it's remarkable how well it worked as a mechanic. <br/><br/>It bears some thinking to think about what kinds of games that would work for, and what kinds it wouldn't--and in those games, what might work in its stead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422409/#Comment_422409" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-03T23:34:37+00:00" title="October  3, 2013 11:34PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>About 1) I'm going to hold off a bit, because I'd like to hear more...<br/><br/>...about 2): could you elucidate what you see as the changes Indy undergoes?

(I'd prefer not to discuss the sequels.) <br/><br/>In Raiders, Indy starts out extremely self-reliant and always looking out for himself, constantly watching his back. This is connected with his dismissing belief in higher powers, which was repeated often early in the film. The progress through the film to trust in a higher power is first of all about having trust, and believing in ideals, which builds to putting his fate in the divine. <br/><br/>The film starts with betrayal (his guides), and mistrust (first meeting Marion), but the later film has more trust - in Marion, Sallah, and then the ship captain. Particularly after his journey through the underworld, this transitions into his belief in a higher power and purpose. \n<blockquote>That said, we started off with talking about story structure--whatever you think about Harmon's particular observations, I find myself very much in agreement that structure is both underutilized and very important to storytelling. Which is why I'd really like to see better what you see.<br/><br/>I'm not as convinced about your last sentence. Lots of people have good ideas. A rather smaller circle are good storytellers. Craft is important, and while to pick up your cooking analogy you don't need to understand organic chemistry to cook, there is a vocabulary and body of techniques that are proven to make better meals.</blockquote>\nI agree absolutely that there is a body of techniques. I don't think that there is just a singular key approach to making stories, though - and in particular, I don't think that one has to learn and accept the Harmon story circle in order to make good stories. I think the Harmon circle is one approach, and some people might get good results out of it - but I think that someone might well reject Harmon and yet still make good stories. <br/><br/>I don't know Harmon in detail, but I've seen a number of story theories applied to gaming - notably Sid Field for the Theatrix game as discussed on rgfa, and Lajos Egri discussed on the Forge.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422410/#Comment_422410" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-04T02:00:55+00:00" title="October  4, 2013  2:00AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 4, 2013 2:01AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>and in particular, I don't think that one has to learn and accept the Harmon story circle in order to make good stories.

Hell, in the podcasts/videos I've seen of him where he talks about it, he still seems a bit surprised that it took off the way it did.<br/><br/>I think it works well for him because it's a very simple framework for a 22-minute episode, and once that framework is established, he can spend the rest of his time decorating the script with all the convoluted and complicated details that make the show fun to watch, and know that the combined weight of all of them might twist the spine of the story in some interesting ways but won't actually break it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422419/#Comment_422419" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-04T07:10:45+00:00" title="October  4, 2013  7:10AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A quick note: Harmon also points out in the detailed explication of the concept that it needs to be modified for serial television; specifically, the characters have to come back to their original state. <br/><br/>Of course, he didn't really do that in "Community", so take it with a grain of salt :-)<br/><br/>I'm certainly not positing that Harmon's found the key to all mythologies here. (I've read a few of those; Frye's was the best, but ultimately it's a doomed project.) The initial condition--event!--change loop is common to a large amount of stories, but not the only structure. (Has Odysseus changed that much when he gets back to Ithaca? Maybe yes, maybe no? Anyway, beyond the scope of this discussion.) Most modern fiction writing classes, at least in Anglophone North America (the only ones I'm familiar with) tell you that story is character, and character has to change for there to be a story.<br/><br/>Criticism and theory is another matter, and quickly gets messy. Artistic criticism always has the same problem: we have to break things down (analysis) to talk about them, but then you reduce the artwork, which is a composite whole that usually requires appreciation of the entire work to be understood, to its pieces and claim they represent the whole.<br/><br/>Anyway.<br/><br/>I was talking RPGs. I like Lady Blackbird's Keys. Gumshoe' Drives are also an interesting device--I'm in the process of trying to use them more in my campaign. My main complaint with the Trail of Cthulhu implementation of Gumshoe is that a bunch of the key concept are really not fleshed out in a useful way. One the one hand, I suppose they can't, really--losing a Drive or getting a Pillar shattered happen purely from the fiction, which I like &amp; appreciate. On the other hand, trying to determine the fictional circumstances that would result in those changes...is much harder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422551/#Comment_422551" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-07T10:58:44+00:00" title="October  7, 2013 10:58AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!
