In the first half, Ryan breaks down the mechanics for us (an interesting combination of mission and scene framing combined with a deck of cards for resolving conflicts that allow characters of all levels to participate, overcoming the class and command hierarchies that have made the genre seem difficult to play in the past).  In the second half, Ryan talks to Neil himself, finding out about his inspirations, his development process and a few other fun details.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.therpghaven.com/podcast/?p=213" rel="nofollow">You can listen to or download the file directly here.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
