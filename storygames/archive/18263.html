Especially the older one. <br/><br/>She's five.  So she's small. But she's even small for a five year old. But she's fast, thinks quickly, and she's cute as a button. <br/><br/>She wants to play Dungeons and Dragons. More specifically, she thirsts for goblin blood. While we've played house lots of times and had adventure stories with Mario and Luigi, her very favorite games are when she pretends to hit stuffed-animal monsters with a cardboard sword. <br/><br/>On the one hand I want to give in and share this world of D&amp;D that I loved as a (10 year old) boy and that I rediscovered through the OSR. I want to show her these dungeons and dragons. <br/><br/>But on the other hand, I don't like the violence, the power fantasy, or the use of the concept of "others".  I'm increasingly uncomfortable with the idea of someone who regularly prevails because they're violent, and even less comfortable with the idea that violence makes us stronger, rather than ruining us. I don't think it's okay to kill them because they're goblins. <br/><br/>But my daughter craves these things:<br/><br/>- Winning<br/>- Being strong<br/>- Not being the smallest<br/>- Clear paths to victory<br/>- Getting stuff<br/>- Getting stronger at regular intervals (she thinks my younger one will get substantially taller on her third birthday)<br/>- Being morally right<br/>- Squashing those who aren't on her side <br/><br/>What should I do?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411883/#Comment_411883" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-11T20:42:57+00:00" title="April 11, 2013  8:42PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2013 8:44PM by komradebob.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) Accept that she'll grow out of it. <br/>2) Play HG Well style Floor Games with her for now instead of D&amp;D.

Regarding the issue of the "other," I wonder if there is a distinction between "other" and "monster." You know? Like, to an adult, a goblin might be a metaphor for a "race," so it's bad to kill a goblin because it's a goblin in the same way it's bad to _____ a ______ because she is a ________. And, one certainly doesn't want to encourage proto-racism where it can be avoided. But, to a little kid, a goblin might not be a proxy for a human.  A goblin might actually be a goblin -- an evil thing made out of evil -- and not human in any way at all. A goblin might be monster qua monster. Is it bad to kill monsters? Is it bad to kill a black widow spider in your bedroom because it's a black widow spider? Is it bad to kill a rabid raccoon? Maybe not. <br/><br/>I don't know. Tough issue. I have to think more about this. <br/><br/>I agree that 5 is definitely pretty young for play violence beyond the level of He-Man, the Super Friends, or the Dungeons&amp;Dragons cartoon . . . Whether the violence in those shows was over the top is difficult for me to determine since that's what I was watching when I was five, and the extent to which I have been ruined as a result is unclear.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411890/#Comment_411890" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-11T22:43:36+00:00" title="April 11, 2013 10:43PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, +1 to Parenting for considering the issues involved. Good on you. Second, I wouldn't presume to advise you on parenting (that may be better asked on another site).<br/><br/>BUT - IF you go ahead; on the matter of games...<br/><br/>I was going to suggest "A Faery's Tale" but you specifically mentioned OSR D&amp;D. It occurs to me that your little one might not grasp the rules anyway; I suspect the interest is more story than game ("let's pretend") - Yes, level up. Yes, let her role dice. Yes, consult your charts and books and look concerned or relieved. But shape the events any way you (and she) want!<br/><br/>The violence need not be graphic or deadly. It's a well-known fact that the "+2 Wooden Sword of Goblin Whacking" drives off goblins who reach 0 Hps. And what an opportunity to teach that perhaps not all goblins are bad or that not all fights can be won by whacking things.<br/><br/>What does she fight for? To save the forest? To help her friends? To defend the weak?<br/><br/>And should she take candy from a witch or get in a stranger's carriage? What happens if she forgets to say "please" and "thank you" to the king/ogre/dragon?<br/><br/>And how nice it would be to have a guardian angel along to whisper advice in her ear. A spirit guide. A talking cat, perhaps.  <br/><br/>I'm not saying you should let her play - I'm just saying: kids will make-believe on their own, anyway. A little guidance; a whisper in the ear; a sneaky life/moral lesson here or there.

Yeah, it kinda is.  It's even a moral imperative - goblins are always stealing and pillaging and murdering stuff.  Not <i>sometimes</i>, not <i>to feed their family</i>, but <i>always</i>.

I'm sure there'll be great advice in this thread about how to leverage it - with great power comes great responsibility, etc.  Teach some lessons about the futility of vengeance?

That's the heart of the pretending game: it's just pretend. And believe me, 5 years old is old enough to know the difference (and too late to correct the base of a personality and principles, except by traumatizing events). On the best possible case, I'd say fictional violence prepares you for facing real violence. It isn't the best preparation, of course, but it gives you a base in the same way lion cubs play with each other to prepare for hunting and socializing when they are older.<br/><br/>I see how much you love your daughter, but protecting her from violence forever won't work better than teaching her how to deal with violence from others or her own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_411933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411933/#Comment_411933" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-12T18:18:09+00:00" title="April 12, 2013  6:18PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think AMBayard has it right.  "Violence" isn't just limited to humans; that's what gets all the attention and the moralising, but we have all those systems in us that make it possible because we are geared up for fighting bears and wolves and whatnot as required.  So I don't think it is surprising or worrying that you child has such instincts, and in fact I'd worry rather more at the attempt to suppress it; this is part of what human beings are.<br/><br/>Also, like it or not, the exercise of violence is self-affirming and confidence building.  It is a way of exercising control over the world.<br/><br/>Last, I grew up in South Africa, so I feel I have a fair degree of insight into othering.  While the idea of goblins et al being a kind of training in othering makes a kind of sense even to me, the reality is that it was never done that way in SA, and I don't know of it being done that way anywhere.  Instead it was done by legally enforced lack of contact; there were never any personal encounters to undermine or contradict the stereotypes that circulated.  Some UK research bears this idea out, with racism most prevalent in areas that had the least proportion of immigrants.<br/><br/>All of which leads me to suspect that fighting goblins isn't going to have the effect of creating that kind of othering.  Even if they are irredeemably capital-E-vil, if you fight them you at least have to think about them, deal with them; if you will, construct a theory of mind for them.  And that's just about the opposite of the way that bigoted societies seem to work in practice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411937/#Comment_411937" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-12T19:30:04+00:00" title="April 12, 2013  7:30PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan,<br/><br/>Awesome.<br/><br/>How do you know that she craves "goblin blood" specifically, and just, say, being the winner of a fight over something worthwhile?<br/><br/>I would imagine that, just like lots of kid's media (e.g. cartoons, fairy tales), it's easy to include fighting and adventure while leaving out the <i>violence</i> per se. <br/><br/>Does she have some favourite books or movies?

Regarding the issue of the "other," I wonder if there is a distinction between "other" and "monster." You know? Like, to an adult, a goblin might be a metaphor for a "race," so it's bad to kill a goblin because it's a goblin in the same way it's bad to _____ a ______ because she is a ________. And, one certainly doesn't want to encourage proto-racism where it can be avoided. But, to a little kid, a goblin might not be a proxy for a human.  A goblin might actually be a goblin -- an evil thing made out of evil -- and not human in any way at all. A goblin might be monster qua monster. Is it bad to kill monsters? Is it bad to kill a black widow spider in your bedroom because it's a black widow spider? Is it bad to kill a rabid raccoon? Maybe not. <br/><br/>I don't know. Tough issue. I have to think more about this. <br/><br/>I agree that 5 is definitely pretty young for play violence beyond the level of He-Man, the Super Friends, or the Dungeons&amp;Dragons cartoon . . . Whether the violence in those shows was over the top is difficult for me to determine since that's what I was watching when I was five, and the extent to which I have been ruined as a result is unclear. </blockquote>\nI definitely agree here. Consider that a kid understands these things a lot differently than an adult. There could be subtle racist undertones (though I don't agree in this case) to this issue, but that's not what a kid will pick up on. They know that the gap between a human and a monstrous people-eating goblin is a lot different from the gap between one human and another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412058/#Comment_412058" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-15T11:32:27+00:00" title="April 15, 2013 11:32AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So you have a 5 year old daughter that wants to play around with the idea of violence and you're afraid that by playing with her, that you'll be encouraging negative behaviors. So I'll be a bit blunt here. That fear is pretty much the same as the fear that, as your daughter enters puberty, that if you talk to her about sex and contraception and where babies come from and all that, that you'll be encouraging her to have lots of sex. And hopefully you know that by not talking to your child about sex, all you teach them is that they should hide their inevitable interest in sexuality from their parents.<br/><br/>This, then, is an excellent opportunity for parenting practice. (I'm not trying to imply that you aren't a good parent. I'm working with the assumption that good parenting is something that takes continual, thoughtful, reflective practice -- which your initial post implies to me is something you value.)<br/><br/>By seizing on the opportunity that your daughter is presenting through her interest, you have the chance to not only have some amazing bonding time, but to also build a trusting communication relationship with your daughter. And to put in some occasional nudging guidance as necessary.<br/><br/>Your play time offers a great opportunity for making comparisons. If someone is bullying her on the playground and she expresses a desire to smash the bully on the nose, you can tell her "Hey now, violence is something that it's okay for Princess Slaysalot to use, because that's the sort of world she lives in. But in our world, we talk to adults about bullies and give them the opportunity to work on the problem." And then - here's the key - you engage really hard with dealing with her bully problem and demonstrate the positive results of having told her parent about it.<br/><br/>I started playing live combat larps like 25 years ago, so my 11 year old son has been swinging foam swords at people since about the time he learned to walk. And since day 1 of doing that, he's learned that he needs to not hit people in the head or crotch, nor is he allowed to swing full strength. So he is allowed to play with these "tools of violence", but only in a structured way that forces him to be considerate of the person he's playing with. This helps him engage with power fantasy and play violence while keeping the needs of others in mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412065/#Comment_412065" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-15T14:07:17+00:00" title="April 15, 2013  2:07PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I might keep the fantasy violence distant from real-world violence so one can't get conflated with the other.  Encouraging a kid to revel in blood, gore and decapitation might set a bad precedent*.  Encouraging a kid to hit goblins until they disappear with a poof, or turn into Care Bears or something, shouldn't run that risk.  And then you can address the horror of that Other thing (the real world thing with the blood and the gore) when they're older.<br/><br/>On the other hand, life &amp; nature will provide plenty of incentives and opportunities for a kid to forcibly assert their will upon their environment, and if you'd rather not be personally responsible for adding more drops in that bucket, Ry, then fair enough.  You could always do "share and make friends" roleplay with your kid and let her slaughter goblins with someone else (who isn't her dad).<br/><br/>*In theory.  In my personal experience, it's not relevant.  I was probably 8 or so when I routinely reveled in my G.I. Joe action figures inflicting gruesome spinal injuries on each other, and this had zero impact on my real-life attitudes toward violence and bullying, as far as I can tell.  It may have even been an opportunity to vent some stuff I knew I'd never do in real life, and get some urges out of my system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412070/#Comment_412070" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-15T15:37:23+00:00" title="April 15, 2013  3:37PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thought on this thread: people here are conjuring up a lot of weird rationalizations while covering up the heart of the matter \u2014 that D&amp;D (and anything close to it) <i>is</i> quite a morally bankrupt game. It's about characters who deliberately choose to go into violent conflicts because of greed; it's about performing violence and trickery and surviving violence. This kind of moral bankruptcy is the core of what makes it fascinating to children \u2014 it's "bad" and transgressive \u2014 and the core of why it's actually not a good message, as a parent, to play straight D&amp;D with your children. Being a participatory medium, it's actually much more serious business than allowing children to, say, watch violent movies (when your children watch violent movies, I would expect you, as a parent and/or adult friend, to provide the required moral commentary, including calling the movie characters on their shit when appropriate).<br/>Sorry that I'm chiming in just to be all negative, but I don't like what I'm reading in this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412074/#Comment_412074" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-15T17:21:17+00:00" title="April 15, 2013  5:21PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the Dungeon Girls thread gives lots of insight on how to handle dungeon delving adventures with younger children without it becoming training in sociopathic behavior.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17329/world-of-dungeons-dungeon-girls/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17329/world-of-dungeons-dungeon-girls/p1</a><br/><br/>Look at the many many times that the father/GM uses the situation to gently guide and nudge his daughters and their friends toward appropriate behaviors, both for their characters and in their player-level interpersonal interactions (not that they are in need of tons of heavy handed guidance, but they are kids, so a little nudge on occasion is necessary).<br/><br/>I will say, though, that old D&amp;D is probably a less ideal system framework for giving opportunities for good parenting. There's just so much in the system that encourages negative things - like the way you are rewarded precisely and only for how many things you kill and/or how much stuff you take, depending on the edition. Other games let you explore dungeons with less emphasis on a morally bankrupt core mechanic.<br/><br/>More than anything, it's in how you approach it. As a GM, you have some leeway in what behaviors you reward and what you discourage. And, of course, you're also a parent - you can always just have a dad moment when the child starts pulling the arms off imaginary goblins. Social feedback is a huge thing in roleplaying games, and a great opportunity for reinforcement. What you choose to laugh at and cheer compared to what you choose to question or balk at are opportunities for you to teach your daughter what is acceptable.<br/><br/>Roleplaying gives your daughter the ability to address her natural curiosity about what is acceptable and what is not in a reduced-stakes environment that allows her to find boundaries and be discouraged away from negative behaviors without getting in trouble the same way she would if she actually went around doing real bad things. It's an awesome opportunity for encouraging positive values.<br/><br/>And whacking gobbos, which is good fun.<br/><br/>Also - if you're worried about blood and gore, remove them. Zero HP means you fail, surrender, drop your gear and run, etc. HP loss does not have to mean viscera and death.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412077/#Comment_412077" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-15T19:07:24+00:00" title="April 15, 2013  7:07PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So you have a 5 year old daughter that wants to play around with the idea of violence and you're afraid that by playing with her, that you'll be encouraging negative behaviors.

But I'd rather not quibble over the fine details of the metaphor. My point was that both sex and violence are things that children feel urges about and things they get lots of media (and peer) messages about. And that the best thing you can do about either of those things is constructively engage with your children on the topics, rather than just avoid them (along with behavior modeling, of course).

Give her those things. It's fun. Get her hooked on gaming.<br/><br/>When she's 7, you can occasionally introduce "not winning" as a concept. That's a good time for a kid to start learning that victories are sweeter when they are intermingled with <del>successes</del> failures (oops, edited).<br/><br/>When she's 8, you can introduce her to the idea that being strong and not being the smallest are not always the bestest, and that embracing small, non-strong methods can lead to really interesting and creative paths to victory. If you've given her plenty of the straight up, whack your way to victory stuff by that time, she'll be looking for something different. And at 8, she'll start to have enough perspective to appreciate that small and non-strong methods have their own value.<br/><br/>When she's 9 or 10, you'll be able to introduce her to games where getting stuff and getting stronger are not a huge deal. By this age, if my experience is anything similar to yours, you'll have introduced her to board and card games. So she'll start to have experiences with playing games repeatedly at the same "power level" and enjoying them. And you'll be able to tie this to de-emphasizing character power growth in RPGs. My son has recently started enjoying Dungeon World, and can see and appreciate how the power level scales very little as characters level up.<br/><br/>When she's 10-11 (or maybe a bit earlier), you can start introducing moral wrinkles and gray areas. Not full on noir, but the occasional tough choices where it's not clear what is "right". Start making the goblins into more rounded beings that have reasonable motivations for what they do.<br/><br/>But you can't do any of these things if you aren't playing at all. And the longer you wait to start embracing that, the more risk there is that she'll be taught by her peers that playing roleplaying games with her dad is not cool. So there's really no good reason not to get started early.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412127/#Comment_412127" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-17T11:03:25+00:00" title="April 17, 2013 11:03AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, thank you, that is awesome.<br/><br/>JDCorley, yes.

Role-playing involves many of the attributes that are common in other female youth-oriented games, including shopping to equip characters, character design and customization, the ability to possess and own pets, and playing a more attractive and mature character. And yet female role-players are still in the minority. The answer may lie in the duration of play. Tabletop role-playing involves sitting at a table for long periods of time with a group.
