It appears that we have fixed the issue now, so anyone who would be served by the European branch now can order a copy of the game there. That's usually much cheaper for shipping purposes than IPR.<br/><br/>That said, I've had a report of a bleed issue, a little line of white along some of the outer edges. Until we've confirmed and fixed that, we've slightly reduced the price to make up for that issue. If that's a concern for you, don't order it yet. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks, and here's the Lulu link for the European version:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/991004" rel="nofollow">http://www.lulu.com/content/991004</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
