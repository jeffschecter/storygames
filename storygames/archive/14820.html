For the purposes of this thread, the trick is to disguise the techniques into a tool that trad GMs already know and love: the random table.<br/><br/>The best part of random tables is that you can use probability to make them not-really-all-that-random.<br/><br/>Here is a (bad) example:<br/><br/>When a player in your group comes up with something you did not anticipate, roll 2d4 and consult this table:<br/><br/>2 - Provide another player with information their character might use to suggest the first player's idea isn't in the group's best interest.<br/>3 - Suggest an alternative that incorporates some element of the player's idea.<br/>4 - Allow the idea, and add something more to it that helps you incorporate it better.<br/>5 - Roll with the idea. Figure out how to incorporate it as you go.<br/>6 - Allow the idea, on the condition the character is willing to pay some small price for it.<br/>7 - Create some kinds of surprise event, during which the players idea becomes moot.<br/>8 - Create some obstacle that makes the player's idea very costly.<br/><br/>OK, so that table sucks. Make some better ones.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336974/#Comment_336974" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T09:58:43+00:00" title="August  3, 2011  9:58AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you feel like bringing real-life problems into the game, roll 1d20...<br/><br/>On a 1, go ahead and stick in a really thinly-veiled grudge monster and trash someone's character over something they did to you in real life instead of working it out like an adult. <br/>On a 2-19, get over yourself <br/>On a 20, consider it, but then work it out like a well-adjusted person and be more generous on your next round of handing out treasure.<br/><br/>When you want to do something but forget the rule for it, roll 1d30: <br/><br/>On a 1, spend forever flipping through the book, grinding the game to a halt over something like the modifier for targeting a grappled in darkness during a hurricane<br/>On a 2-7, flip through the book briefly and then make your best guess<br/>On a 8-26, ask around the table for what people think it should be then make a call based on experience<br/>On a 27-30, make something up that sounds interesting with only brief consideration for what the actual rules would be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336981/#Comment_336981" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T10:38:49+00:00" title="August  3, 2011 10:38AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2011 11:39AM by Jocelyn Robitaille.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            EDIT: Deleted because it added nothing worth adding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336983/#Comment_336983" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T10:40:06+00:00" title="August  3, 2011 10:40AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>When someone is trying to 'trick' you into being a better GM</b>, roll +cool...<br/><br/>On a 10+, no problem.

Also a way to handle situations that might delay the playing of the game.

They can create the threat, but they can't create a threat that's custom-made for their own abilities -- in fact quite the opposite. <br/><br/>So you don't get the Ranger player always making it be his favored enemy that's showing up again (to draw on a D&amp;D example).<br/><br/>Nicely done.<br/><br/>However, I don't think you could convince trad gamers to do it all the time. That would smack of "under-prepped GM".<br/><br/>I think it would be more like "When the players approach a location and you don't have something specific planned for them there, roll..."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337035/#Comment_337035" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T16:43:50+00:00" title="August  3, 2011  4:43PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>You can't engage with Lester's genuine attempt to be helpful, so you just shit all over it?</blockquote>\nOh geez, I'm sorry.

It's a quick background generator:<br/><br/>Roll 1d6 for family:<br/>1) You're an orphan, only son, raised by a distant relative<br/>2) Raised by your Father alone<br/>3) Raised by your mother alone<br/>4) Mother and Father still alive<br/>5) You've got your mother and father plus 1d6 brothers/sisters alive, one of which is -roll 1d4:<br/>     1) well known adventurer<br/>     2) a genius, younger than you<br/>     3) always getting in trouble anywhere<br/>     4) also an adventurer, younger than you and following your steps<br/>6) Big family Clan: Parents, uncles and aunts, grandparents,  2d6 brothers and sisters, roll twice in the previous table.<br/><br/>economic situation: roll 1d6<br/>1-2 Poor, assign 5 copper coins to inventory. You've lead a life of (roll 1d6)<br/>      1) slave, beggar, <br/>      2) performing some act at the market<br/>      3) surviving on your own in the wilderness<br/>      4) being a servant<br/>      5) working your <a href="/forums/profile/%24%24">@$$</a> off in a farm or other place<br/>      6) exploring and hunting monsters<br/>3-4 Doing ok, assign 1 coin of gold to inventory. You've lead a life of (roll 1d6)<br/>      1) exploring and hunting monsters<br/>      2) entertaining people, specify how<br/>      3) surviving on your own in the wilderness<br/>      4) jack of all trades<br/>      5) working in a farm or other place<br/>      6) service for a noble<br/>5 Rich, assign 10 gold coins to inventory. You've lead a life of blah blah...add as many other economic situations you can come up with<br/><br/>Because of the life you've lead your family... (roll 1d6)<br/>1) Has expelled you and denied your inheritance for dishonoring them.<br/>2) doesn't want to know anything about you<br/>3) Don't care about what you do<br/>4) understands, though they don't like it very much<br/>5) respects you more<br/>6) Completely supports you.<br/> <br/>there's also a roll for the history of your family and ancestors reputation, however the fun begins here. Roll 3d6 for the next 3 tables and made up the story of why your character started travelling with the things that come up on the table, other PCs backgrounds and the setting in general :<br/><br/>Breakpoint (roll 1d6)<br/>1) Debt (of blood or monetary)<br/>2) challenge<br/>3) robbery / kidnapping<br/>4) sickness<br/>5) Accidental Death<br/>6) Assasination or massacre<br/><br/>of/to/from<br/>1) nemesis<br/>2) close friend<br/>3) local authority<br/>4) relatives<br/>5) romantic interest<br/>6) whole tribe/village/town/city<br/><br/>that sends character in a travel for<br/>1) search of a person, item, information or other solution<br/>2) revenge<br/>3) escaping<br/>4) training<br/>5) redemption<br/>6) search for money or influences<br/><br/>Add a table for other equipment according to economic situation and you're done.<br/><br/>However tables shouldn't be used all the time on every single session, they are tools best left for those times when the GM or the players are short of ideas and need something quick and shallow. They can be used to generate anything from monsters to dungeons, but it's true that they become old soon if you keep using them without refreshing. A cool option would be to have index cards for every item on a table, roll dice on those as if they were a table and change/rearrange the order of the index cards to keep the trick fresh.<br/><br/>I don't reccomend rolling for tables in the middle of a session (and even less during a combat) since the operation of rolling dice, checking the table and coming up with an idea to make it all plausible can take valuable seconds away when you actually need a quick reaction either as a GM or from the players. I'd say this is part of the prep, not something to be used in-game. That's why I've got my doubts about the Mythic GM emulator quickness. I'm specifying the wasted time is just SECONDS, if you're ok with it fine, but I don't like at all the effect that small pause has in the game flow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ADamnFox" title="ADamnFox"><img alt="ADamnFox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ADamnFox">ADamnFox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337239/#Comment_337239" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-05T00:09:20+00:00" title="August  5, 2011 12:09AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it too late for <a href="http://www.geekchichq.com/furniture/emissary/" rel="nofollow">this</a> joke?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337260/#Comment_337260" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-05T06:59:31+00:00" title="August  5, 2011  6:59AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2011 7:00AM by zircher.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wordman</cite><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>People know about the Mythic GM Emulator, right?</blockquote>They will when they have a<a href="http://www.mythic.wordpr.com/page14/page9/page9.html" rel="nofollow">link to it</a>.<br/>Funny, I just made a VBA empowered Excel sheet so I can do a running log for GME.
