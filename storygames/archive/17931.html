I think he mentions he got the "formula" from some other writer.<br/><br/>It's something along the lines of:\n<blockquote><br/>One: What does the character want?<br/>Two: Why can't s/he have it?<br/>Three: [something something else I can't remember]<br/></blockquote>\nDear reader, you can do one of three things in this thread:<br/><br/>1. Help me find that quote in the videos! If you're never seen them before, they're interesting and worth watching, just hit pause when you hear that bit.<br/><br/>2. If you know the quote or formula, just post it here. I know it's a famous one, but I can't find it with my Google skills for some reason.<br/><br/>3. If you have a favourite "formula for story", of any kind, or want to create a new one, post it in this thread. We can compare them all afterwards.<br/><br/>Go!

There are these two where it comes up, though:<br/><br/><a href="http://kfmonkey.blogspot.co.nz/2009/05/writing-sequence-shuffle.html" rel="nofollow">Writing: Sequence Shuffle</a><br/><a href="http://kfmonkey.blogspot.co.nz/2009/05/writing-sequence-shuffle.html" rel="nofollow">Leverage: The Real Fake Car Job</a> [SPOILERS]<br/><br/>My take ...<br/><br/>When I'm working on a script, making sure my reader cares about what's happening is much like making sure there's subtext: I've got to engineer it so that it's in there.<br/><br/>A fundamental part of it is making sure that I want to watch the characters: maybe they're likeable, maybe they're awesome at what they're doing, maybe they've gotten themselves into a situation where there's absolutely no way they can get out of it and we want to know what happens next.<br/><br/>And that leads to the next part of it. I approach a script or a story as a series of questions. I want to raise questions in the reader's mind, and give them the answers within a satisfying amount of time (or after a satisfying amount of delays), while at the same time raising more questions that the reader wants answered.<br/><br/>So, really, my answer to that third question is that I have to make myself care, and there's (obviously and unhelpfully) tonnes of ways of doing that. I've heard the Coen Brothers write their characters into a corner and then wait for as long as it takes until they suddenly think of an way out that surprises them. Personally, I like to find my characters' flaws and then sadistically engineer them into a situation where I can hammer them with it. Another technique I like is the Sorcerer or Dogs in the Vineyard method of finding out what a character values or believes and then putting them into situation after situation that tests whether they live up to their beliefs.<br/><br/>Ideally, the question that should follow on in the reader's mind from "Why do I give a sh!t" is "What's going to happen next?"<br/><br/>Subtext is another classic way of making us care. There are lots of different ways of approaching subtext: the twist; we know something the character doesn't; all the other characters know something the character doesn't; the scene as a metaphor for an underlying issue; having what's happening right now reflect or be the consequence of something that's happened in the distant past; etc, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405557/#Comment_405557" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-06T06:20:27+00:00" title="February  6, 2013  6:20AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rickard's link to Manet's version ("Why now?") is also a good "third question" in this formulation.

Fairly little has been done in terms of mechanizing subtext (although some games, like It's Complicated or some ways to play PTA, can be said to explore this), but I find the "indie RPG scene" to be full of useful advice and techniques to address this kind of stuff. Everything from Nordic LARP techniques to thematic aspect development (advice I very often see on these boards and used to see at the Forge) is very present in the discussions, in my opinion. This whole "I've had enough of conflict-conflict-conflict" diatribe comes up often enough that it's clear on a lot of people's minds!<br/><br/>So, worth exploring, but I think we've started making inroads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408117/#Comment_408117" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T07:49:05+00:00" title="March  5, 2013  7:49AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a big fan of the "story circle" described by Dan Harmon. <br/><br/><a href="http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_104:_The_Juicy_Details" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_104:_The_Juicy_Details</a><br/><br/>I've used it while running games to design NPC story arcs with a lot of success. I make a circle for each major NPC, and I make the "go" part of the circle the point where the NPC expresses a need to the PCs. If the PCs don't radically alter the situation (which happens a lot) I just keep marching through the circle when I need to frame a new scene. So, I'm never at a loss for an idea. Sometimes I make one circle lead to another, and I usually have several circles going at once.

Dan Harmon is great. What's funny is that on his podcast, they play Dungeons and Dragons, but the game is in front of an audience and just for laughs -- their games don't have much structure. I think it's ironic that I use his story advice to help my gaming, and I listen to his gaming which has very little story. :P<br/><br/>Anyway, regarding my group's games . . . I was running a Don't Rest Your Head hack where all of the characters were werewolves. I wrote down a list of NPCs that I thought would make for interesting antagonists/plot hooks. I came up with the list based on information written on the PCs' character sheets, and then I made up some of my own. For example . . . <br/><br/>-- Reporter who wants to uncover truth about werewolves<br/><br/>-- Grizzled old hermit werewolf hunter<br/><br/>-- Government agency that knows about werewolves and wants to weaponize them<br/><br/>-- Girl with suicidal werewolf brother<br/><br/>-- Cult that wants to sacrifice a werewolf and cause hell on earth<br/><br/>-- Pack of NPC werewolves <br/><br/>-- Rowdy small town teens who have captured a werewolf in a well<br/><br/>-- Murderous weresnake girl who seduces her prey<br/><br/>-- Normal local police and first responders <br/><br/>and so on. <br/><br/>For each one, I did an 8 point story circle. For example: <br/><br/>You: Olivia Redding (murderous weresnake girl)<br/><br/>Need: a meaningful relationship<br/><br/>Go: notices a PC who she is attracted to in a bar (werecreatures were able to recognize each other in our game, but Olivia had never seen another one, so she thinks maybe he is a kindred spirit.) <br/><br/>Search: helps the PC/defends the PC/rescues the PC. (In our game, a PC got into a brawl, and ended up checking a "fight" box. So, he beat a guy nearly to death. Olivia offered the PC a ride to her place in order to escape before the police showed up.<br/><br/>Find: hooks up with the PC. (She offered. He accepted.) <br/><br/>Take: reveals that she has a captive who she is planning to eat/transforms into a 30' snake monster. (That happened)<br/><br/>Return: If the PC is into the grusome relationship, Olivia becomes jealous of the other people in the PC's life, and starts hunting them down. If the PC is horrified and runs (which is what actually happened) she starts stalking him and killing his friends (this was presumably happening off screen, but we didn't get to this point in the game) <br/><br/>Having Changed: showdown with PC. (We didn't actually get to this point in the game) Does she accept her monster side? Does she learn to fight it with the PC's help? Is she killed? Does she become a permasnake? <br/><br/>I started everyone in the same place -- ostensibly on the same circle. But, whenever a PC would wander away from one story line, I'd just have him encounter another NPC circle at the NPC "Go" point. Sometimes they'd wander back to an earlier plot line -- when the PC who was involved with Olivia jumped out of her window to avoid her freaky snake love, he found the other PCs who were dealing with the cult plot, and he never saw Olivia again. However, if there was a lull in an "on screen" plot, I would try to reveal issues from an "inactive" plot. Like, when the PC who hooked up with Olivia was standing guard by himself, he kept receiving psycho text messages from Olivia. <br/><br/>I thought the story circle thing worked really well, and there wasn't much prep time. Each point in the circle would only have a few words to jog my memory. So, I think I knocked out like 15 circles in an hour, and we never even used most of them. We played about seven or eight 3 hour sessions. <br/><br/>Occasionally, something would happen that would stop a circle -- like the death of the relevant NPC. I'd just put an X through the circle and move on to something else. <br/><br/>Sometimes I'd get fancy and have one circle lead into another. Like, the brother of the "girl with the suicidal werewolf brother" was the same werewolf who the "local boys" had trapped in a well. <br/><br/>Anyway, I will almost certainly try it again the next time I run a game. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408141/#Comment_408141" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T10:22:49+00:00" title="March  5, 2013 10:22AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah!

You got it. (Also, that's almost exactly what I wrote for Olivia.) Sorry about the confusion. I probably shouldn't have tried to explain my prep and what actually happened in the game using the same sentence. :P <br/><br/>I try not to be too railroady. So, in theory, one of my NPCs at the "GO" part of the circle could have made a request or demand or invitation or whatever to the PCs which the PCs flat out ignore. That's fine. It just means that particular plot line won't become part of the story. Or, like I said before, an action of the PC might radically alter one of my circles or stop it entirely. That's fine too. I primarily used the circles to help me think of "what should happen next." There was one PC who was so motivated by his own agenda that I just followed his lead and didn't confront him with any of my NPC circles for much of the campaign.<br/><br/>I felt that using the circles for NPCs was very helpful for both creating a dynamic world and motiviated interesting NPCs. But, lately I've been thinking about what kind of game would mechanically encourage the <b>players</b> and not just the NPCs to follow a pattern like the Dan Harmon circle or some other plot model. XP based on hitting the plot points? Explicit scene framing relating to plot points?

Overcoming the problem or achieving the goal is what the story is about. So, I'll look through the character sheets for ideas about their goals. And, I'll think about problems each PC might encounter. I think it's good to personify the problem or goal when possible, so I'll give a name to each one. Those personifications become the NPCs. I also think about themes that I want to address -- e.g. "werewolves embracing their curse" or "werewolves resisting their curse" or "werewolves as prey" or "werewolves as weapons" or whatever and I'll personify those themes. I'll also just have random character ideas I think are cool. <br/><br/>Then I do a story circle for each NPC. I try to make sure that the thing that the NPC "needs" requires the action of a PC. "Go" is typically the point at which the NPC attempts to act on the need and seek the attention of the PC. In the werewolf game, one of the NPCs was a girl named Lilly Boomer. She needed somebody to help her get her suicidal werewolf brother out of a well. But, she didn't trust anyone because she didn't want people to find out about her brother. When she saw one of the PCs turn into a werewolf, she thought that the PC would understand, so she waited until the PC was human and asked for help -- which was her "go." So, my circle was: <br/><br/>You: Lilly Boomer <br/>Need: Rescue brother <br/>Go: Ask PC for help<br/>Search: Coax/force/trick brother out of well<br/>Find: He's out!<br/>Take: He turns into a werewolf!<br/>Return: Lilly gets scratched or bitten.<br/>Having Changed: Arwooooo! <br/><br/>"You" and "need" were "offscreen" and explained by Lilly to the PC. But, that doesn't HAVE to be the case. The "need" can happen organically in the game. To me it just seems easiest to think of initial encounters at the "go" point when planning because once things are happening in a game, it's hard to predict what will happen. I make the complete circle, but I don't know if the PCs will end up where I guess. It's just helpful to have a guide for what to say when a PC wanders off somewhere. <br/> <br/>Alternatively, I'll have NPCs who don't care about the PCs at all and who don't talk to them directly but who have "needs" that are bad for a PC. When the NPC begins to act on the need, it gives the PC an incentive to take action. Like, say the PC is Batman, and the NPC is Dirk Swizzle, the CEO of LandCo. Dirk might "need" to build an apartment complex, and his "go" might be to attempt to buy the land directly above the Bat Cave. Batman better do something or else . . .\n<blockquote>How can you keep track of eight circles? How do you think when you switch from one circle to another?</blockquote>\nSo, I got the idea to use the Dan Harmon story circles from the Apocalypse World idea of "fronts." It's pretty much the same thing. I come up with a handfull of antagonists and issues in the world and then I make it clear that the PCs have a chance to do something about those issues. But, I don't throw all of my fronts/circles into the game at once. I just start with one, and proceed with it until a PC (inevitably) wanders away from it. When the PC wanders someplace else, I make them encounter a different issue. As far as keeping track, I just cross off the points on the circle that have already been completed, so I know the next thing that will happen. It proved to be a much better system than my previous method of jotting down zillions of little notes that I later had trouble reading or following. \n<blockquote>Do you seek to intertwine some of the circles when you create them? So that one circle can affect another one. </blockquote>\nYes. I did that a few times. I would give NPC A a need that somehow involved NPC B. Or, I would make some event on one circle be the cause of a "need" in another circle. Like if the "return" of NPC Grod the Dragon results in the flooding of an underground layer. That means that the other monsters who used to live there are now homeless so, You: displaced goblin horde Need: new home Go: sack human town! etc. etc.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408282/#Comment_408282" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-06T12:56:21+00:00" title="March  6, 2013 12:56PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool stuff!

(If you played magic the gathering, I sometimes think of it a bit like resolving the stack.) Not a circle, quite, a spiral that returns to the source from a different angle.

If we look at the opposite sides on the circle: his <i>need </i>to spread his message will <i>take </i>his life.<br/><br/>The cops got their own circles, but they are subordinate to the antagonist's circle. According to my interpretation, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408774/#Comment_408774" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T16:47:57+00:00" title="March 11, 2013  4:47PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Hey, I wonder how <i>Big Lebowski</i> holds up under these models.

The Dan Harmon position is that ALL stories follow this pattern, but I wonder if that's true, or if there are ways to manipulate the pattern effectively. Are there storyteller virtuosos who have such a firm handle on the basics (like the Cohen brothers) that they can make other plot patterns that are somehow just as satisfying. <br/><br/>It reminds me of a thing I was reading about where mathematicians needed a model that would allow them to divide by zero in order to make certain discoveries, so a dude invented a new way of looking at a sphere that was still accurate but allowed people to break certain rules.

What makes for a question that'll stick? What makes for a question to which you as a writer can give a good answer? What makes for a good delivery of the content in question?</blockquote>\n<b>The fundamental question</b><br/> <br/>You can probably think of a ton of stories that have a huge over-riding question in them, that we're watching to find out the answer to. Movies are especially good at this (Will John McClane stop the terrorists? How will Calvin deal with Ruby Sparks coming out of his novel and into his life?). I find good television is structured around this sort of thing to (Can Tony Soprano find a way to make his family life and his mob life co-exist? Will House always be a damaged f--kup who ruins the lives of the people around him?)<br/><br/>Two obvious ways of making that fundamental question compelling are (1) High stakes: the price of failure is catastrophic ... but failure would also create an interesting situation, and (2) A compelling choice: whichever way the (usually) main character decides, the consequences re-define them and their life.<br/><br/>Episodic television offers us a third non-obvious way to make that fundamental question compelling. In most TV shows, we're not going to kill the main character (or any character off). So 'death' can't be a convincing source of high stakes. However, we can 'change' a character: make them guilty, make them evil, force them into a situation where they have to make some crappy choices and live with it. 'Change' is a compelling possible outcome to a question because we lose the character we loved and they transform into someone a little bit different. As an example, have a look at Wesley in Season 3 of Angel.<br/><br/>So, some ways of phrasing this fundamental question are "What\u2019s just happened to you?" What\u2019s the situation you\u2019re in that makes you worthy of watching? Worthy of being a protagonist?"<br/> <br/>In games, we have <br/>- Don't Rest Your Head, which asks: What\u2019s just happened to you?<br/>- Ryan Macklin\u2019s <a href="http://ryanmacklin.com/2013/03/murderous-character-ballad/" rel="nofollow">Murderous Character Ballad</a>, which asks: \u201cWhat\u2019s he done that\u2019s worth killing him?\u201d The real question is \u201cWill someone kill him?\u201d<br/><br/>- Sorcerer, where the Kicker asks what\u2019s just unstabilised your life and what\u2019s your new life going to look like?<br/> <br/> <br/><b>The basic sub-routine</b><br/> <br/>So, nested inside that fundamental question are a bunch of really common questions that are immediately applicable to games:<br/><br/>- What do you do?<br/>- What happens as a result of that?<br/>- What happens next?<br/> <br/>These are basic tools in writing a story. In 'Story', Robert McKee talks about the basic element of story being "the gap between expectation and result". A character does something and what happens surprises us, throwing out our assumptions about what will happen next.<br/><br/>If you've watched British horror series "The Fades", the fourth episode (which features Paul in a hospital) is an incredible example of constantly subverting our expectations.<br/> <br/><br/><b>The emergent questions</b><br/><br/>But something else also happens in a story or in a game. Things that we care about emerge. There may be a whole cast of characters and relationships, but some of them shift into being 'objects of fascination' or things we consider need to be resolved in order for the story to have a satisfying ending.<br/> <br/>- Relationships<br/>- Characters we care about<br/>- Particular situations<br/>- Particular mysteries<br/> <br/>Look at Lost. At its absolutely highest level it's nothing more than a series of nested questions. Now, the answers to individual questions aren\u2019t necessarily that satisfying, but the drive to KNOW keeps us watching. <br/><br/>And as the show goes on, stuff that wasn't even important in the first season become riveting. Will Sawyer be redeemed? How will Sawyer-Juliet-Kate-Jack resolve itself? Can Juliet be trusted?<br/><br/><br/>---   ---   ---<br/><br/>Anyway, that's a quick answer but I hope that gives the thread some more ideas.                        </div>\n<div

<i>Zodiac</i> wasn't the most satisfying story in the world either.  I guess the "change" is that at the end Graysmith is finally unburdened of his obsession and can theoretically move on with his life, though we don't actually see that on screen.  Or maybe the "change" is that, during the arc covered by the film, he gets <i>more</i> obsessed, to the point where <i>is</i> capable of losing everything.  I dunno.<br/><br/>I went back and looked at <i>Heart of Darkness</i> and I was completely wrong about Marlowe's transformation being unstated.  He says right at the beginning of his tale that the event with Kurtz "shed light on everything".  And the story ends with Marlowe's listeners looking off the boat ahead into a "seeming heart of immense darkness".  Marlowe has indeed become the master of conveying "the horror".  Pretty cool, I think.  It just didn't stick with me in Harmon-logic because it doesn't really follow Harmon's arc <i>chronologically</i>.  Or, at least, not in any sort of equal proportions.

I wonder, can we go any deeper?  I think the ingredients you listed are all fairly obvious things to aspire to, but pulling them off can be easier said than done.  Though perhaps here I'm running into the gap between hooking the curiosity of a watching audience and hooking the curiosity of a decision-making player.  An audience, when met with a seemingly insoluble mystery, can simply wait and enjoy being surprised by how the show/movie solves it.  A player, on the other hand, needs a visible path forward so they don't give up or get frustrated.<br/><br/>My hope is that there's some significant overlap in the form of detective fiction -- movies or shows where the protagonist needs a plausible path forward to answer the questions that have been posed to both them and the viewing audience.  How do you hook the curiosity of a fictional private eye?  Is the investigation always just a means to the end of a paycheck or romance or vengeance or escape, or can the pursuit of answers really be the driving force?<br/><br/>I feel like the classic Cthulhu intro highlights the challenge here:<br/><br/><i>GM: There's some unexplained weird stuff going on in this town!<br/><br/>Player 1: There could be any number of rational explanations for that.<br/><br/>Player 2: Sounds dangerous, I'll stay away.<br/><br/>GM: But that's where the adventure is!<br/><br/>Player 1: Oh, okay, I guess I'll play a character who's just plain obsessed with apparent weirdness.<br/><br/>Player 2: And I'll play someone heedless of danger.<br/><br/>GM: Cool!

The issue of chronology and/or sequence is interesting. I think the issue of hitting the story points in sequence is, arguably, more important in a movie, TV show, or play than it is in a book because of the time element. A movie lasts for two hours, and you have to keep an audience's attention. It's kind of like a song in that way. If the performance of a story isn't building steam in real time, people might not be hooked in enough to appreciate it. A text is a different with respect to time (and a zillion other things), so maybe it's okay to swap the plot points around. I don't know. An rpg is wildly different from the other storytelling mediums -- so, I'm sure the analysis there will could be weirder still. I'll have to think about this more.  <br/><br/>Regarding equal proportions for each point -- I'm pretty sure I read a Harmon thing where he expressly stated that he didn't think the points had to exist in remotely equal proportions so long as they exist.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409632/#Comment_409632" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-19T15:38:20+00:00" title="March 19, 2013  3:38PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>How do you hook the curiosity of a fictional private eye?

I don't think this is limited to private eye games. I think hooking curiosity of players is the holy grail no matter what the genre. This is a giant difference between story games and written stories. A writer can decide what the character wants/needs -- the GM can't. <br/><br/>I struggle with this kind of thing all the time. Some players in my group seem almost allergic to conflict. The epic struggle to end the world will be moments away and they will calmly wander off looking for a coffee shop. The reverse will happen too. A player will have a goal that provides xp or something, and relentlessly pursue it while ignoring all social or political consequences in the game. I think players tend to create "people" who live in a "world" and not "characters" who are instruments in the realization of the structure of a "story." That's not a bad thing. But, it makes protagonizing the PCs tricky. How do you get to find, if you choose not to go? <br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409640/#Comment_409640" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-19T17:31:17+00:00" title="March 19, 2013  5:31PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2013 5:31PM by Emily_Care.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a great thread! It's helpful for some research I'm doing. \n<blockquote>One: What does the character want?<br/>Two: Why can't s/he have it?<br/>Three: [something something else I can't remember]<br/></blockquote>\nThis reminds me also of Robin Laws' Petitioner/Petitioned division that he talks about in Hamlet's Hit Points, and uses for scene framing in his Drama System. The basic ideas is that in each scene, there is a character who wants or needs something, and someone who can give it, or who is being asked to get involved in some way. I'd be surprised if there are many scenes in Game of Thrones, for example, that don't fit this structure. <br/><br/>It's a good dynamic for rpgs, where you want to have tension between important parties. It's a common structure in film, tv and literature, though of course there is much variation, and I imagine that dynamic is strongest in certain genres. <br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409670/#Comment_409670" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T06:09:06+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  6:09AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2013 6:58AM by David_Berg.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you talk any more about Drama System scene framing?<br/><br/>My first reaction to that Petitioner/Petitioned thing is to worry about the tension between (a) playing characters according to player visions of who they are and what they'd do and (b) game participants manufacturing tense scene fodder.

Most of them are used for developing stories as entire pieces, before the performance of the story, as opposed to an RPG, which often develop the story [i]through[/i] performance.<br/><br/>I've always found it more useful to approach scenes from an actor's perspective rather than a writer's.  Creating good scenes leads to fun play even if the plot doesn't end up adhering to the structure of a 'well made play', which is ok, because RPGs are a very different medium than television, film, or theatre.  And if you string a series of linked, interesting scenes together, more often than not, story will emerge.<br/><br/>Three things that are useful for making a scene interesting (as an actor) are: The Objective, The Activity, The Actions/Tactics.<br/><br/>The Objective is what you want out of the scene.  What are you trying to accomplish?<br/><br/>The activity is what your character is physically doing in the scene.  It's largely colour, and should be largely unrelated to the Objective or Action, because that's more interesting.  If your Objective is to 'Prepare for your Mother's Arrival", sweeping and cleaning is boring.  There should be tension between what you want, and what you're actually doing.<br/><br/>The Action or Tactics are how you're going to get your Objective.  They should shift as a scene progresses.  Try to distil them down to a single verb, directed at the scene partner.  Playing a verb is always better than playing an adjective.  The best way to explain this, is to watch a child try to get their parent to buy a toy:<br/><br/>"Oh, that's so cool.  I really want it.  It's so nice.  Please?" Beseech<br/>"I'll be so good if you get it for me.  I'll be good for a week.  I'll never ask for anything again."  Bribe<br/>"Johnny's Mom got it for him.  Why can't I have one?" Guilt<br/>"I've been so good and I'm just asking for one little thing!" Appeal<br/>"I hate you." Threaten<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>If everyone focuses on making the scenes interesting, then you don't need to worry about rising action.  The action will rise from the conflicts.  And to be perfectly frank, I tend to find rising action in games pretty boring, because the required initial low intensity scenes are really hard to play without established characters.    When actors work on a script, they know the entire arc of the character and can see the relationships already fleshed out when they start to play the first scenes.  They also get to rehearse and build rapport.  That's very hard in an improvved situation -not impossible.  Long form improv troups can be very good.  But it's hard.<br/><br/>Better to start with a bang, and the high action, and if necessary, show flashbacks of the rising action once you've gotten to know the characters you're playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409793/#Comment_409793" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T15:08:04+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  3:08PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2013 3:10PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds very cool!

Hmm.<br/><br/>I'm a little lost on "Activity".  Is it like, if I'm playing the child, then my Objective could be "get parent to buy toy" and my Tactic could be "bribe", and the Activity could be... uh... riding in a race car that my parent is driving, which distracts them from my attempted bribery?  But that seems somewhat contrived for comedic effect (why would I be asking then?).  And "Activity: walking past a toy store in the mall" seems so obvious it's not worth calling out.

Everyone takes turns framing scenes. To frame a Drama scene you say, who is there, where it is, how long since the last scene, the situation going on and the Intent of the Petition. The Intent is handled in two ways. If you frame a scene where your own character is the petitioner, then you don't have to declare your intent. If you cast someone else as the petitioner  you suggest an intent and they get to accept it or make an adjustment to it. If the petitioned character turns out to have no reason to resist, this becomes a no-contest scene and is kept brief. Two-way, and multiple exchanges are allowed. <br/><br/>An example I've scene of a really good match between Activity and Goals or Tactics in a live scene involved cleaning up after dinner. The characters were involved in a very passive aggressive conversation about who got to say what went in their relationship, so the question of who picked up a table napkin became very important. The players were excellent actors, with characters who were well matched in their issues to create conflict. This was in a game of Under my Skin. Since the players help co-create the characters, it helps them play off of one another even though they don't know the future of the story arc. They know the issues the characters are dealing with and what buttons to push. The game also comes with a built in general story arc, though the specific events always vary.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409800/#Comment_409800" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T16:23:48+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  4:23PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2013 4:29PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, okay, so the Activity might best have examples, metaphors, microcosm or macrocosms of the Objectives in play?
