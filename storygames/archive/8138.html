That way people can look for a free game that actually has had some more in-depth coverage then just their designer's advertisment lines. Now you could actually decide up front wheter you are going to merely glance at it, or choose one to take the dive with. This way you're already invested some up front by (re)searching a fitting game. <br/><br/>Second, id try creating an active community around your game. This seems like a hard one. Perhaps a way for players to invest in the game like Legend of the 5 rings CCG did with its overarching story. Maybe one idea is to write a game in a way that creates (the illusion of) play from the beginning. Learning the game as play itself so you're again already invested without having to make the decision to invest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179073/#Comment_179073" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T04:36:22+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  4:36AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Commitment is a ritual, so basically anything that forces the prospective player to think about his motivations and priorize the issue before getting access to the text would help in this regard. It could even be as simple as requiring the person to send you a personal email to get the game, which would create a social connection. Or having a waiting period. Or asking for $50 which would then be returned after the person actually played the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179074/#Comment_179074" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T04:46:23+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  4:46AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are other investments than cash, sure.  Cash is one we all understand because either we have it and spend it or we don't have it and want it!<br/><br/>Time and Emotional investment are the two other main types for gamers.  People can get emotionally invested in something because it relates to something else.  There are a lot of people right now who're desperately hoping that D&amp;D 4th ed just goes away and dies, because they've invested so much time and energy in 3rd ed*.  Imagine, though, what their reaction would be to 4th ed if 3rd had been out of print for a couple of years: a new edition! yay!<br/><br/>The Dragon Warriors reprint is a great example of this, I spent a great many hours as a kid playing DW, I was completely pumped when I heard there was a new version.  Needless to say, DW isn't really my bag these days, but I'm heavily emotionally invested in it.  Ditto Starblazer Adventures: I was reading those comics at the same time I was playing DW.<br/><br/>So, games I was pre-invested in before buying them.<br/><br/>Another way to get people to invest is to make them want to like a game.  I was pre-invested in Unhallowed Metropolis because it sounded really damn cool.  It's an OK game, but I took the time to read it because I liked the idea of the setting.  If people enjoy a TV show, for example, they're pre-invested in a related RPG.  See the mediocre Serenity RPG for example: people sure as hell weren't buying that because it was a great system, they were buying it because it was based on a TV show they liked.  So if you put out a free game which was regarded as the unofficial Heroes** rpg or something, you jump-start part of people's investment.<br/><br/>If you could get people to spend time talking about a game online, that's an investment.  It's easier to get people talk about something they're already invested in though, so that's not an easy one.<br/><br/>* I'm not saying that there aren't people who just plain don't like 4th though, just that a lot of the people reacting so badly to it are doing so because it isn't 3.75<br/><br/>** Probably a bad example, because several RPGs already on the market model that show just fine, but you get what I mean.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179138/#Comment_179138" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T11:14:35+00:00" title="November 18, 2008 11:14AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you <i>give</i> me your free game, I'm likely to play it.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179150/#Comment_179150" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T11:39:47+00:00" title="November 18, 2008 11:39AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you tell me why it's fun right up front, and how i'm meant to interact with the other players in the game to have that fun,<br/>then i can pass that along to my play group and we're more likely to want to play it.<br/><br/>especially if it does something different than the other games we play do.

If you're friends with the creator, you've got a personal investment. This isn't always enough (I have several gamer friends who I couldn't pay to play my games) but it is one step of investment.<br/>\n<br/>\nCommunity: Either being part of a community like this, or forming a community around your game will help. I'm vastly more likely to play Geiger Counter than Free RPG Created by This Guy that I run across on the net, because I share a community with Jonathan Walton. If I go to a game-centric community to ask about it because it sounds interesting, I'm investing, especially if that community is welcoming and helpful. Simply by asking the question I've made a small investment. By liking the answer I get, I'm likely to identify with the community, which will increase my chances of playing the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nFavors: If you're doing something for me in return for me trying out your game, then I'm likely to do so, even if that something is small. Buy me a beer, for example. This tactic is usually combined with the personal and community.<br/>\n<br/>\nProfessional interest: If I do something for your game, be it edit, write a bit of fiction, do illustrations, even if that is for pay, I'll be more interested in playing it. <br/>\n<br/>\nPre-Investment: Clinton Nixon's Paladin had me pre-invested, simply because I love the archetype of the Paladin. I was interested in the Serenity RPG, though I eventually did some research and opted out, because I didn't like the system (I'm a mechanics monkey; I'll play a game just 'cause it's got neat mechanisms) but I wouldn't be averse to playing it if someone were to offer to run it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSupport: An absolute must, I think. Others disagree, but being available to answer questions, give advice, get enthusiastic that people are playing and loving your game, create play aids and supplements, whatever.. So long as the game isn't just a document in the ether, this will improve your chances at getting player investment.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally (for me; this list is obviously non-exhaustive) is quality. Make sure the game is good. The rules should work together to do what you want them to do. It shouldn't require the people playing to have a pocket version of you to make the game work. It shouldn't require them to ask a crap-ton of questions on the message boards to make the game work. That's not to say that they can't ask for clarifications, but the game should work as intended if they just follow the rules as written. <br/>\n<br/>\nMake sure the product is good. If it's just a .pdf with no art, make sure it's the best .pdf with no art that it can be. Well written, no misspellings or weird typographic errors, a font that doesn't induce eye-strain, alla that. If there's art, make sure it's clean (as in clean lines, not morally clean), subject-appropriate art. If you wouldn't want to see it in a product you paid for, don't put it in a product you're putting out for free. Obviously your opinion and the opinions of others will differ.. I liked most of the art in TRoS, but there were some major detractors. But don't put it in there if you wouldn't want to see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, anything you can do beyond just getting the game out there will increase investment. Obviously all of these tactics work as well for non-free games, and there are others that work as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
