The last playtesting I made with my group revealed that while the game we were testing could be functional and fun on it's own, it was still a half-baked game. And that wasn't something nobody on the table realized but me, since it was my design and what we played that day wasn't the game I wanted it to be. So I'm back to the design table trying a new improvement.<br/><br/>It would be better if we could have a true playstorming, but in my group I'm the only one designing new games and somehow even I haven't been too interested when other friends of mine tried designs of their own. I realized that most of the cases that was because I found quickly that we weren't in the same page and that the game they wanted and the game I wanted were quite different. There's nothing bad with that, but it just makes me feel like I can only give them some feedback on whatever they try, instead of adding or changing stuff from their design, because that would be tearing apart what they actually want.<br/><br/>I dunno, I think it's for the best to have only one designer on the team and as much playtesters as you can get, unless you can work in a game just for the fun of hearing and adapting to other people's ideas and not care much about for the result (I mean, care enough to do a good job but not enough as to grow too attached to it's current form)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387894/#Comment_387894" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T09:08:04+00:00" title="August 23, 2012  9:08AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll be there too! <br/><br/>In terms of choosing games to offer, Wyrmwood,  I don't share your situation adn can't really offer advice.

Like you, one of my biggest stumbling blocks is that I'm often coming at design from a different perspective, set of goals, and collection of practical and theoretical tools than most indie and traditional designers.<br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388745/#Comment_388745" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T15:23:16+00:00" title="August 29, 2012  3:23PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's make this more concrete. I want some general thoughts on how to get the most out of Metatopia by choosing the right game to bring. I figure I can't be the only person who is making a decision like that.<br/><br/>Do you recommend to bringing a long form game with a few hundred playtest hours already broken up so that different sessions at the convention will occur at different points along the life cycle of the game?<br/><br/>How much playtesting before hand do you advise: none, a session or two, or significantly more? Especially given more playtesting means more things are getting nailed down in the design.<br/><br/>How experimental a game would you think is advisable? By experimental, I mean how far off the typical traditional and indie design patterns do you recommend going?<br/><br/>I'd appreciate both player and designer perspectives,<br/><br/>   -Mendel<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
