We used the Dallas 1963 Playset that my buddy found online. Lots of very specific locations and names in the playset that we had to look-up. Our story never actually had anything to do with Kennedy, but the tension of his ensuing arrival in Dallas was evident throughout.<br/><br/>Mike [Jacob, Hired Killer]<br/>Shawna [Jacob's sister, Carol a waitress at an Italian Mob-affiliated lounge]<br/>Travis [Tony, Bartender at aforementioned lounge]<br/>Julie [Krista V., receptionist at Federal Building]<br/>Me [Ted, Secret Service agent]<br/><br/>I shall paraphrase, because I don't like to write play-by-plays. Ted has hired Jacob in the past to take care of problems. In turn, Ted uses his police powers to make Jacob's crimes disappear. Ted swiped some counterfeiting plates and needs Jacob to sell them for him to pay off his gambling debts (to Tony's boss). Carol finds a I.D. badge for a man that Jacob killed, but that Ted made disappear from the system. She suspects the worst and approaches her friend at work, Tony. Tony knew the dead man because he was a teamster and obviously affiliated with the Mob. Krista, Tony's college friend, has two tickets to Veracruz, Mexico and a massive Fatal Attraction level crush on Ted. Late in the game is was determined that Krista was part of the Ruby family... which was a nice, wicked twist.<br/><br/>The story opened with Jacob visiting his sister at work asking for her helping in introducing him to some major players. Carol is naive to her boss' credentials and shakes her head. Jacob ends up shooting a cop outside the lounge before returning home. That was scenes 1 and 2. From there, things fly out of control quickly.<br/><br/>Sexual tension between Ted and Krista. Carol tries to convince herself that her brother isn't a hired killer. Tony clearly reveals himself as more than "just a bartender."<br/><br/>At one point, Jacob spikes Krista's drink and tosses her apartment, where he finds dozens of photos of Ted taken from far away distances.<br/><br/>After the Tilt, Krista's infatuation goes into overdrive and she effectively kidnaps Ted. Of the last 10 scenes, almost all of them are at the airport during the cat and mouse "getaway" where gunfire, death, and a lot of arrests make Ted look good, even though he is not. Thanks to some unbelievable rolls all around, Jacob became very dead with his roll of 1, but everyone else walked away, albeit a little dirtier. Krista took the tickets and left the country to live off of her family's "reward money." And Ted gave the counterfeiting plates to the Mob to pay off his gambling debts, leaving him no where closer to getting out of the situation he is in.<br/><br/>I'm sure I missed some details. But our best Fiasco game so far.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332498/#Comment_332498" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T10:56:22+00:00" title="June 30, 2011 10:56AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like a fun session! A few questions for you:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>Five player game.</blockquote>\nI have usually found that five player games can be too big to sustain one major storyline, and that often there will be two different storylines that usually end up intersecting. From your short description it's difficult to tell, but I was wondering whether that was your experience in this game?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>Our story never actually had anything to do with Kennedy, but the tension of his ensuing arrival in Dallas was evident throughout.</blockquote>\nThis makes me really happy. Everytime I've played this game, someone has ended up going for the (Kennedy's) jugular. I'm curious whether you made references to his arrival during play? Or just noted that he was showing up soon at the beginning of the session and left it at that?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>Of the last 10 scenes, almost all of them are at the airport during the cat and mouse "getaway" where gunfire, death, and a lot of arrests make Ted look good, even though he is not.</blockquote>\nOk, that is pretty fricken cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332560/#Comment_332560" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T15:14:38+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  3:14PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Caesar,<br/><br/>I was only the player who selected a need in this one, so the story of me paying off my debts, selling the counterfeiting plates, and dealing with a love-sick woman all collided. Mike made a few things happen, but the rest of the players were playing damage control, trying to figure out our next movies.<br/><br/>No. We made mention of his arrival several times. I commented that I was on the security details a few times and even told the woman kidnapping me that I had responsibilities that couldn't wait.<br/><br/>So far, most of my Fiasco sessions have ended with me (the dirtiest character) getting away with it. In a previous game, I was a zookeeper who sold all the old animals to people who wanted to each exotic meats. I also was stealing from the people who worked under me. In the end, I made my way to a Animal hospital to get a wound patched up, and ditched my wife for the hot Veterinarian there.<br/><br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332564/#Comment_332564" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T15:50:31+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  3:50PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>In a previous game, I was a zookeeper who sold all the old animals to people who wanted to each exotic meats.

I didn't really care, but at least two of the other players were seriously gunning for it.  Er, so to speak... (facepalm)<br/><br/>Still, major fun.  I got to be a corrupt FBI agent who ended up getting thrown out a window, arrested and falsely imprisoned for conspiracy to assassinate the president and injuring a hooker.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332574/#Comment_332574" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T17:39:01+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  5:39PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2011 5:39PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favorite session had Kennedy hire a hit team to murder Jackie.
