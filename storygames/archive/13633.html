There has always been a very strict criticism in system flow and functionality, and a downtime is seen as an unforgivable design mistake. You never see boardgamers disagree on that.</blockquote>I took up the point, thus: <i>Interesting observation! I've often wondered at how weak the discourse on this point has been relating to role-playing games. By comparing it to boardgames, I believe you have shed some light on that. Thanks!</i><br/><br/>And "kobutsu" answered me thus:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kobutsu</cite>Interesting. I suspect that downtime is<em>essential</em>to TRPGs. They seem to carry a larger cognitive load than many other forms of game\u2014and certainly a larger load than conversation. (I say this based on my observation that the pauses between turns-at-speech in TRPGs are much longer and more frequent than in normal conversation. I have yet to do a systematic study of this, but I hope to!) So downtime gives you a bit of time to re-collect your thoughts, and plan where to go next. I think a trick to good design and good play is to have exactly enough at the right times.</blockquote>I believe it is good for the interaction to reduce the amount of downtime as much as possible. There are other elements to consider, of course, but I do not see downtime as anything we should strive to have in a game.<br/><br/>I do not believe that the "larger cognitive load" is something that demands a lot of delays in interaction. We are quite capable of handling the cognitive load, if the game is designed to make it easy for us. So we should strive to make easy-flowing games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308203/#Comment_308203" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T11:33:09+00:00" title="January 14, 2011 11:33AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2011 12:36PM by Suna.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there is a misunderstanding in terminology between downtime and pause.

I think of the <i>mechanics</i> as one of the areas of methodic tools available to the designer. The mechanics has to be weighted against the other tools of the trade, especially the other main methodic area; the <i>dialogue</i>. <br/><br/>In some games it is ok to make the mechanics dominate the method, and in some the game will benefit from stronger dialogue-tools. BUT; whatever tools your game make use of; having the fiction arrested by a method with serious limps built in, is not my cup of tea. It will turn me off the game. I want the game-method to drop me right on Piccadilly Circus, man, not in a dusty dead-end with no interaction for miles.<br/><br/>The natural ebb and flow of the fiction, however, is fine with me. Just don't make a game with all ebbs, and no flow, and expect me to like it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308299/#Comment_308299" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T16:46:02+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  4:46PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2011 4:47PM by whduryea.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think the problem is downtime in general so much as downtime that marginalizes one of more players.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a lot of ways games can do this. In a mechanically cumbersome game, this may be the moment when the one player who has been able to memorize all the rules and mathematical minutia uses this knowledge to gain an advantage in play that makes the other players feel like their characters are superfluous. In a game with a strong GM role, this is when play devolves into, "Shut up and let me tell you a story." In a narrative game with clearly distinguished roles, this is when one role dictates that its player spends large portions of the game observing quietly from the sidelines.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are extreme examples, but I think they might help to illustrate what we're really talking about when we say "downtime." It's not just ceasing to be the center of attention for a scene or two, it's actively being denied any hope of playing an important role in a series of scenes or a full session because of a failure of game design and group dynamic.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, at least, that's how I've always interpreted it. I don't think there is something fundamentally wrong with having moments in a game when some of the players take a more passive or supportive role, but no player (or players) should be railroaded into passivity or supporting status because the game design arbitrarily benefits one player or role.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308300/#Comment_308300" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T16:51:53+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  4:51PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>If I spend two or more scenes in a row not being focal or important, I count that as a failing.</blockquote>\nIt's not always about you, Joe.<br/><br/>Right.

It gives me some variety, and, as someone who used to be the default DM back when I played D&amp;D;, I can sometimes feel trapped if I'm expected to play one and only one character for an entire session/game. I don't see why supporting characters need to be boring to play just because they are not at the center of a story. How many times have films been stolen by a brilliant character actor who appears in only a single scene? (Most recent example: Bear Pelt Dentist in <i>True Grit</i>.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do, however, think that audience roles can quickly become alienating or marginalizing, especially if the audience players are given extremely limited input into the scenes that they are watching.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308303/#Comment_308303" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T17:11:49+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  5:11PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>nothing other than social contract (and exhaustion) prevents everyone from being intensely engaged at all times.

As his definition has nothing to do with the previous ones.<br/><br/>I propose that we call the "I need to stop and do [too much, unnecessary, for this game] math" <b>'bad mechanic stop'</b>, that is when play stops (in the active player's turn) to make a mechanical resolution of such complexity that it should have been weeded out in play testing, according to the player.<br/><br/>The previous definitions of downtime were objective, there simply was nothing to do, except for to reorganizing your resource tokens, stacking dice or perhaps pondering your next move.<br/><br/>But a bad mechanic stop is highly subjective to the player, since it's happening on the active player's own turn, there is clearly something to do (and hence not downtime in the traditional sense), but the player finds it tedious and game breaking.  <br/><br/>I have played games where I have experienced such bad mechanic stops, especially during combat.  But where other players have found the same situations to be the heart of the game. They could still experience mechanic stops, i.e. how story focused play stops in order to go into rules focused play, but since they didn't think that the stops were out of proportion, or rewarding enough the stops where not <b>bad</b> mechanic stops.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_308344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308344/#Comment_308344" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-15T02:59:08+00:00" title="January 15, 2011  2:59AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2011 3:02AM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><br/>Downtime = the time we take fiddling with mechanics</blockquote>I changed this to "Mech-time" in my last post.

If the design is too full of such time, and frequently halts interaction for some or all players, the fiction will come to suffer.

And even when not actively participating, you might be taking some quiet time to think about the game, maybe even in character, or perhaps planning what you might do next or how some facet of the rules is not working properly. <br/><br/>As such, it's not always easy to determine the extent to which someone is participating in the game and even what participation means. Can you participate without interacting? I don't think it's clear at all. <br/><br/>For example, what's the status of character generation? Is that downtime? What if it's done in isolation, like typically in AD&amp;D, as opposed to Mortal Coil or FATE where the rules say you should do it together as part of the game? Are these two things different?

The turns are up-tempo, often with scenes that are dealt with in seconds (in battle the scenes are little more than initial situation, one reaction, and a final point, before racing on ...). The point is to run through lots of scenes, to simulate the chaos of human interaction in situations with a lot happening at the same time. Most scenes are dealt with outside the resolution system (although the res-system in Fabula is fast).<br/><br/>The audience time is so short no one have any reason to leave the table.<br/>- And this is important: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all players present makes all players part-take</span> in the full effect of the play-mode; the whole group experience the chaotic nature of the situation. <br/>- Equally important: when we go around the table again and again, the scenes start to feed into each other, and make the social weave even more interesting. It's like the town/celebration/tournament becoming something of its own, through the eyes of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> our characters. Even though the mode allows for a lot of characters going their own ways, the players still create <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a shared story</span> out of it. <br/><br/>I find this play-mode to be easy to do, effective, popular amongst the players, and great fun for the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308586/#Comment_308586" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-17T17:10:27+00:00" title="January 17, 2011  5:10PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas,<br/><br/>Can you give an example of what play looks like in this "up-tempo mode"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_308598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308598/#Comment_308598" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-17T23:34:26+00:00" title="January 17, 2011 11:34PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2011 1:53AM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actual play, up-tempo mode, barn-party:<br/><br/>Player A (Pront): me and Gonder sits behind the barn, drinking.<br/>Player B (Gonder): Jihaaa!

(suddenly smiles) Now, Gonder, you seems like a nice man. Who's your father?<br/>...<br/><br/>- and so on.<br/>___________________________<br/><br/>The scenes don't tie into each other thematically like this all the time. Mostly the focus will shift from one thing to another, and a third, especially in the early stages of the play-mode. Keeping several balls in the air is easy, and fun, and one of the reasons I invented this particular play-mode. <br/><br/>The key to it is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tempo</span>; as a GM you must be ready to cut a scene, and start the next, with no words to "fill the gaps", just: "Cut! Next scene!" (Cut &amp; Go). It has modifications for different situations, but essentially it works the same for all kinds of situations with lots of people interacting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308603/#Comment_308603" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-18T01:14:50+00:00" title="January 18, 2011  1:14AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>Tomas, Tazio,<br/>I try to design my games so that what you refer to as downtime IS the game.

It may be tricky, but here's a definition that might help. <br/>Downtime is when the time you stop playing in order to solve math is too long. By which I mean: the time you take between declaring intent and determining outcome ruins the enjoyment of the game. <br/>What I understand from the description of your game is that it's based upon manipulating resources and managing them. No downtime per se in that. Unless you design rules that make it a slow and boring process.<br/>If you are actively using and manipulating numbers and that has a tangible result, be it a modifier or a narration consequence, that's not a downtime. It becomes a downtime when calculating that modifier or whatever your numbers do takes a long time and people get bored with doing all that math. <br/><br/>Let's take D&amp;D 4ed as an example. When is that you do the math? Mainly when you compare your dice roll with the armor class and when you calculate and subtract damage from target's HP. You do that lots of times whithin a combat, but it's  reasonably quick.<br/> <br/>Let's now take an obvious, extreme and known to all example of a terrible system completely drowned in downtimes. F.A.T.A.L. Yeah, I spoke the word. Now Story Games is going to be swallowed by the psychic maelstrom. Ok, check this:<br/><a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/d/dungeons-and-dragons/fatal-worst-rpg.php?page=10" rel="nofollow">warning: foul content. Oh well, we're talking about Fatal, we all know, don't we?</a><br/>How much time does it take to solve this math for the average human player?<br/>See where I'm going? Of course it doesn't have to come this far to be considered a downtime, but that's the most obvious example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_308606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308606/#Comment_308606" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-18T01:30:24+00:00" title="January 18, 2011  1:30AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2011 1:45AM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Suna</cite>Downtime is when the time you stop playing in order to solve math is too long.</blockquote>It is downtime to fiddle too long with the mechanics, of course, but I believe the definition needs to be more neutral.<br/><br/>My try: Downtime is any time where you, your group or your game leave or arrest the flow of fiction (see my tentative map of "downtime" further up the thread).<br/><br/>Keep <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the fiction</span> in mind as the aim of the role-playing/story-game, and you will see that "downtime" is indeed a thing to minimize, but still; in most games it is <i>necessary</i>.

But it does totally make sense when applied to rpgs.<br/>And yes, a minimum downtime is necessary. Totally. When it becomes too long, you get the hiccup effect. Otherwise it flows jolly flash.<br/>But could you please specifiy the "in order to solve mathematical calculations" part in your definition? <br/>Otherwise any pause would become a downtime and it would not be an issue with the game's mechanics, while in fact, that's what a downtime is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_308612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308612/#Comment_308612" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-18T01:55:59+00:00" title="January 18, 2011  1:55AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2011 1:57AM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe we need to talk of <i>different kinds</i> of "downtime" in relation to role-playing games, so here's my "Map of Downtimes" again:<br/><br/><b>1 - Audience time</b>= you are not participating in the current scene, but stay with the game<br/><b>2 - Mech-time</b>= the time we take making the mechanics influence the game<br/><b>3 - House time</b>= you go to the kitchen, the loo, the balcony to take a sig, etc.<br/><b>4 - Social time</b>= the time we spend talking of other things, greeting each other, bantering, etc.<br/><br/><b>Pause and flow</b>= natural shiftings in the fiction, and our engagement in it.

But the one I refer to is meant to point a flaw in a game's design. House and social times wouldn't be. They'd be, well, just pauses. Whenever I refer to a downtime, I am saying "hey, that game has a bug!"... of course we can use the term with different meanings... <br/>I need to consult with my boardgamer peers and see how universal the term is in that world. I have shifted my focus from rpgs to boardgames only recently, and I'm not yet sure.<br/><br/>And regarding the fiction in boardgames.

It might be that it is simpler to use it like that in relation to rpg's too, and find another term for the things I'm trying to focus on here.<br/><br/>Maybe "fiction-stopping"?<br/><br/>Anyway: we need to be aware of how <i>the flow of fiction</i> may be arrested in different ways. Discussing it is easier if we have names for the things we discuss, It is an easy way to avoid misunderstandings, and a simple way to make ourselves a tad more conscious of the theme.<br/><br/>So: let's not get bogged down in a definition-debate.

Physical cues, gestures, etc?</blockquote>I tend to use my hands when cutting the scenes, but otherwise: no. <br/><br/>Often I set a kind of "fiction frame". It is simple:<br/>- <i>Now we play the barn-dance. Each scene must be in or around the barn, during the dance.</i><br/>- <i>Now we play the city. Keep your scenes in the city.</i><br/>- <i>When battle ensues, we go into battle-mode. The pace is high, so be ready to act! And be ready to frame your own scenes when I give you the right to do that. Here we go ...</i><br/><br/>And then we play out a string of tiny scenes, more or less as in the example given above. Sometimes the scenes is set by the GM, and sometimes the GM and some of the players, but mostly the scenes is set by all, in fixed or fleeting turn. <br/><br/>The point is to keep your GMing simple and effective. You set the pace by cutting the scenes sharply, to ensure a rapid succession of them. You may use words and hand-gestures to cut, and are ready to jump over players not ready to set a scene (and tell them to be ready for the next scene). The GM is free to set scenes whenever she wants to. And then she has her own turn too, which is usually a scene with all characters present (depending on the nature of the group and place). The ordinary GM-scene signals that one whole turn of scenes has been done, and that a new one begins (with any extra premise the GM want to include). You may go for any number of scenes in this play-mode, until the setting element has been properly explored.<br/><br/>To contrast the rapid succession of scenes in this mode, it is effective to make a "reflective scene" afterwards (or in-between), in which the pace is totally different; slow and laid-back, to facilitate a reflective mood amongst the players (and characters). The moment you start working with contrasting tempo as a GM, you may sense some greater <b>rhythm</b> to your game-play, and start acting like a conductor of an orchestra. As a conductor your first mission is to serve up <i>different moods</i>, by shifts in tempo, for the players to interpret through their characters.<br/><br/>This is, of course, a bit outside the theme of the thread. But it is fascinating stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308690/#Comment_308690" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-18T17:38:33+00:00" title="January 18, 2011  5:38PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for sharing, Tomas!<br/><br/>Some very interesting things to think about in there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_308706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308706/#Comment_308706" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-18T21:51:35+00:00" title="January 18, 2011  9:51PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for asking, Paul!
