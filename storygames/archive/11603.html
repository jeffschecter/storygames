Most of them, at character creation time, are plausibly specific, so I'm not talking about abusive abilities such as "luck" and the all-time lows of "intuitive leap" and "surreptitious interrogation". In the games I'm talking about, these attributes are the most important constributor to the success of a contest, so not a few percent here or there (like in D&amp;D). In resource management games, it's not an issue.<br/><br/>We're playing, and everyone is going through their character sheets, racking up bonuses, usually in a plausible fashion. The acrobatic noble character with repart\xe9e spends his whole time doing things acrobatically, nobly and with repart\xe9e, swinging around and jabbering like a a blue arsed-monkey at every opportunity. The seductive smoker is smoking and being seductive, every time.<br/><br/>The "most fussy player" rule suggested by Vincent in DitV doesn't do the trick because, you know, we are all good roleplayers, and cf. "plausible", plus, who wants to spoil other's fun with a big downer? The GM can come down with a heavy hand and have a mini-debate on every roll, but time waste and cf."big downer". <br/><br/>It means, systematically, that everyone has stacked almost every bonus, every time, which means it (the system) becomes almost redundant. It also means that characters get into their niche and sit there. The latter can be good in certain settings, but it can get a bit old, a bit quickly.<br/><br/>Does anyone else find this to be an issue? What solutions have you come up with? I have some ideas, but I'd like to hear from others first.<br/><br/>There is probably some clever theory term for this, and maybe even previous discussions. I'd be happy to be look at those if anyone knows where they are.<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> I'm not sure if this is a play advice or game design issue, I hope it's the former.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258648/#Comment_258648" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T05:38:19+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  5:38AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bigger bonuses for subverting the conventions of an attribute? <br/>She's seductive, sure, but what if it's not her looks that are doing the seducing this time?

That Ability specification thing is probably the key ingredient in how we make this sort of thing work in Solar System: that game's Abilities are relatively wide (considerably wider than DiV traits, for instance), which makes it easier to say that one or other Ability is the most applicable one in a situation. An important principle here is that the Abilities other characters in the setting possess help define and determine the Story Guide's judgment. For example, if the player was trying to use "Blue-Arsed Monkeying" in a horsemanship situation, and we knew that our crunch landscape not only includes a horsemanship Ability, but that Ability is also available to this character, then we would be mandated to require a Horsemanship check instead of the blue-arse routine. I guess this principle could be phrased simply by saying that all characters have all Abilities, except for exclusive ones, and you're always required to use the most applicable one, whether you have it on your character sheet or not. The game has a flexible side-support mechanism for when multiple abilities apply, though, so you get to use your Blue-Arsed Monkeying in a secondary role in everything your sensibilities allow.<br/><br/>I have to confess that this isn't much of a problem for me, though. I suspect that this has something to do with my specific focus and preference in roleplaying games: I don't think of characters as defining themselves by what they do, so it's not a problem for me if a given method of conflict resolution comes up frequently. If it does bother me as a GM, I can easily enough bring situations where using a given trait is problematic or impossible, for variety's sake. Still, I'll have to note that Conan does the wrestling/swordsmanship/athletics trinity all the time, and that doesn't seem to get old for him as a character. And as we know, Conan is the final word in rpg theory, always and forevermore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258654/#Comment_258654" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T05:59:20+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  5:59AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I rather like the way <i>Full Light, Full Steam</i> did it: traits like that also have a penalty attached to them, and you don't get to use the bonus in the session until you've used the penalty (to "charge the battery").  But I guess that falls under the "resource management" heading, huh?<br/><br/><br/>So, er, play advice.  Well, if no one feels like they can sit up and say "Seriously, cut it out already," and no one feels bad about using all their traits all the time, then maybe that's okay.  Maybe everyone is having fun and no one needs to do anything different.<br/><br/>But if that's not the case, then the people who aren't having fun need to find a way to say "cut it out" without being big downers.  My suggestion would be to talk about it as a group some night before you actually play; just sit down and hash out what everyone thinks is an appropriate way to handle these traits, maybe house-rule in some resource management scheme if that'd help keep everyone in line.  Having this discussion outside the game is important, I think, because you don't want this to feel like a personal attack on anyone, and if you try to negotiate it in the middle of a scene there's really no other way it can be taken.<br/><br/>You could also try changing the game itself to one where repeating the same character beats and staying firmly within a single, perfectly-defined niche is entirely appropriate:  most pulp genres are like this, for example.  No one reads a Sherlock Holmes story to see Holmes solve a crime <i>without</i> resorting to his phenomenal powers of observation, after all.  There's a character who pretty much uses every one of his plausible traits constantly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258658/#Comment_258658" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T06:23:06+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  6:23AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2010 6:23AM by jenskot.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fallout in Dogs in the Vineyard is great for this.<br/><br/>Players decide what specific fallout they take and what parts of their character it affects.

Risk meaning it can decrease or increase in potency and/or change in description. <br/><br/>If you allow for the option to alter a trait description via fallout (if it went down by 1 die, what does that look like?) you give the players an opportunity to break from potential monotony and tell you how and what they want to play now (almost in real time). <br/><br/>Bonuses are great rewards to guide behavior and reincorporate elements to create patterns.

These do not have base skils onto which you can add bonuses. For example, in your case, the character doesn't have a horse riding skill, but the GM can't point at the existence of a horse-riding skill, even on another character sheet, and stop them stacking every ability:<br/><br/>It would be:<br/><br/>Player: I swing acrobatically onto the horse, sliding left and right as I go through the trees, and mocking those chasing me with my repart\xe9e. I slice away overhanging branches with my sword to aid my passage, and Motivate the horse with my spurs.<br/><br/>Me: Hmmm.<br/><br/>To get this in perspective, I'm still enjoying the game.

Maybe the thing that really makes this work in Solar System is the fundamentally robust ability-piling system stolen from Sorcerer - players are free to pile on abilities into an ability check, but the benefit diminishes with elegant mathematics, so in practice you only do it if and only if you care to for the right reasons. I have to say that I also have a no-nonsense GMing style where mere colorful description really isn't enough to justify adding an Ability to a check - if you want to use your Swordfighting, the conflict has to actually involve swordfighting, not just drawing your sword. But even that's just a superficial aesthetic preference, the system itself doesn't break no matter how anal-retentive the player wants to be about going through every ability on his character sheet as support checks for the main check.<br/><br/>Heroquest is a good example of game that in its earlier incarnations suffered of bonus-hunting; characters have a fuckload of abilities, all of which can be transformed into bonuses for each other, and your best roll involves taking your highest ability and then justifying everything else on the sheet as bonuses. This was often criticized as a clumsy system that encouraged players to be repetitive and detail-orientedly methodical, slowing the game down and boring everybody, the player himself included. The newest edition of the game sort of solves the problem by limiting the number of supporting abilities to just one per check; it's reasonable enough compromise, although lacking in flair.<br/><br/>I think that one thing we see here is that while the problem is recognizably general, there are lots of little nuances in individual rules-systems both procedurally and mechanically, and those count when we look at how urgent this and other similar aesthetic issues are. Perhaps there is no general cure for it aside from working on saying no without being a downer. Alternatively I guess you could fix each game's system so that it doesn't reward repetitive and excessive bonus-piling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258670/#Comment_258670" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T07:28:26+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  7:28AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if the abilities give you diminishing returns (i.e. Agon)?

If you use no supporting abilities, maybe you get an extra bennie or something.<br/><br/>Permutations: Supporting abilities have levels (+1, +2, +3) and you reduce them by one level instead of checking them off entirely.<br/><br/>Kinda resource-management-y, but then it becomes easier to choose not to use every ability all the time, or choose the RIGHT time to use it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258679/#Comment_258679" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T08:05:06+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  8:05AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2010 8:25AM by Christian_Griffen.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the flip side of diminishing returns, give bonuses for using each of you abilities at least once.

Ultimately, this means an Adventurer will want near-equal efficacy at range or melee, avoiding overly focusing in one.<br/>* The Damage system involves reducing a victim's die values (similar to DitV fallout). So, again, broadening ones options, rather than building a deep, focused specialist, is encouraged. This check is mainly to control escalation of Adventurer Traits, not Weapons or Gear, because higher and higher ddie values cost more, progressive (i.e. diminishing returns).<br/>* It is possible for the Opposition to generate environmental conditions in an area which can prevent the use of one or more specialties. A@H is a competitive game, so the "downer issue" is somewhat mitigated (it's "cock blocking," now, and perfectly valid play).<br/>* The Adventurer is always subject to the Challenge rule (viz Universalis) when instantiating found Loot (the only way to get Big Gear)--plausible narration of where or how it was found is required to avoid having to win a bidding war just to BEGIN to pay for the Loot.<br/><br/>So, to generalize:<br/>- Inherent situational restrictions on efficacy. Some traits simply may not be invoked, for they are mechanically restricted to a subset of all gaming situations. Risk: That every character will become a Swiss Army knife (not a problem in A@H--there's only one PC).<br/>- Ability to aggressively reduce trait efficacy, coupled with diminishing returns as a traits efficacy increases, encourages broad (as opposed to deep) trait development. Risk: Same as above--bland, generalized characters (in A@H, how you choose to face opposition is mostly color, not choosing a subset of mini-systems that your character engages like in a "class" system).<br/>- Auto-correcting scope of efficacy for traits via a challenge system which makes overly broad traits that much more expensive; and that correction scales the additional expense from situation to situation, via a "market-driven consensus" as to what everyone will accept as valid. Risk: Everyone goes broke blocking each other.<br/><br/>Additionally, this comes up all the time in DitV, and the common approach is "Oh, really"? What about NOW?" That is to say:<br/>- Build the narrative and its challenges assuming that the characters have all the efficacy they will ever need. It's not CAN you do it; it's WILL you do it. Risk: Approaching the "system doesn't matter anymore" point above. Which is why it can not be the sole solution; which is why one or more of the other generalized approaches must also be used.<br/><br/>HTH--God knows *I* need some help getting my head around the issues!<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258683/#Comment_258683" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T08:23:03+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  8:23AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some possible solutions (to the problem of monotony):<br/><br/>1. You can't use the same trait twice in a row. Used that trait (or skill, or aspect) last roll? Use something different!<br/><br/>2. You can't advance without failure. Dogs kinda does this: you need to take Fallout in order to get better (see jenskot, above). If you want to get better, you need to fail, so you will start taking risks in certain situations. Then when you really want to win, you go back to your tropes (a la Sherlock Holmes; see Accounting For Taste, above).<br/><br/>3. If you lose a roll, your opponent can alter your traits (as in Cold City or Hot War), so if you do beat a player, you can lower the score from a trait you are starting to get bored of.<br/><br/>4. You (as the GM) could also just challenge the players in ways that explicitly deny their best traits. Hey, no, that's not appropriate, good roleplaying or not.<br/><br/>5. You could also be having a problem with the way these traits are written. If they are simply adjectives (Sultry, Dashing), you can bring them in no matter what you do. I swing on the chandelier, in a <i>sultry</i> manner. I sneak into the enemy compound, silent, unseen... and utterly <i>dashing</i>! (Although, for the record, I think this is horseshit.) Instead, your traits could have to be specific verbs (Reign Down Vengeance Upon My Foes), or unique items (Shield of Baldur), or really specific circumstances or settings (Knowledge of the Swamps). I mean, sure, the players will still be angling to get into situations where they can use their traits, but hopefully they won't push it enough they become jackasses, yeah? Or, let them set the scene sometimes, and other times, don't.<br/><br/>6. Give them lots of traits? If you've got enough choices, you won't always be angling for the same boring old tropes.<br/><br/>7. Put a maximum on the amount of traits you can use at any one time, and combine it with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%236&amp;Mode=like">#6</a>.<br/><br/>8. In Houses of the Blooded, you have to actually define when you can use your Aspects, though I'm gonna assume you don't like that solution.<br/><br/>That's a few, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258704/#Comment_258704" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T09:00:42+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  9:00AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2010 9:05AM by Potemkin.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite>Player: ...and mocking those chasing me with my repart\xe9e.</blockquote>\n"Me: I refuse to give you a bonus for 'Repart\xe9e.'

This pretty much guarantees victory. (Full disclosure: I'm one of those players.) Different players will have different ideas about what sort of stacking is acceptable - and they will all be right. That leads to inevitable clashes of expectations, and has certainly soured my games. The games' only advice on handling this amounts to, "You can do that" in some places, and "Don't do that" in others.<br/><br/>It's my only problem with PDQ games, and it's such a big problem, I've lost interest in playing them (I'm usually the GM) until I can figure out a way of approaching these games that makes me happy.

Any mechanical technique that<i>limits</i>how I use Repartee prevents me from deciding when something's fun and when it's not.<br/>8. Any GM-based adjudication that prevents me from using Repartee prevents me from having fun. I don't want to use Swordsmanship instead or use Repartee differently or Try Another Way. If I did, I would have done it in the first place.<br/>9. When it stops being fun, I'll stop using it.</blockquote>\nIt's not using repartee in every appropriate conflict which is the problem I'm talking about (I was using my own character, not yours, as an example), it's using almost every single bonus possible in every single conflict, however clever or entertaining that might be. If you think "I'm going to fight my way out of every situation." that's fine, if you think "I'm going to bring swordsmanship into every conflict, fighting or not," you are looking at the problem.<br/><br/>I'll post compile a list of potential solutions tomorrow or Monday.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258907/#Comment_258907" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T06:15:37+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  6:15AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I imagine the problem lies somewhere in between: I like to fight my way out of every situation, but I'm <i>particularly</i> tempted to do so because of this mechanical bonus.

Cap stacking, either at a fixed level, or using diminishing returns (eg adding dice and taking the top two rather than adding bonuses. Disadvantage - people will still stack up the limit anyway, meaning that traits become mechanically less important, though the incentive is less.<br/>2. Restricting the re-use of traits using resource management (eg X times per session, not twice in a row, the bonus lessens)<br/>3. As GM or player, be that downer. People will get used to it, and love you for it, eventually. If necessary use the phrase "douche."<br/>4. Peer pressure, but with "calling out" a less socially awkward thing.<br/>5. Only offer rewards when PCs "lose" (eg Poison'd)<br/>6. Insist on a narratively distinct use of the trait each time.<br/>7. Retrospectively tighten up or change traits which turn out to have too many legitimate uses.<br/>8. If someone in the scene, or even not in the scene, has a more specific skill you can't bring your skill into play. (Mortal Coil). Problem, why shouldn't I use my sword fighting in a duel against a duellist?<br/>9. Offer a bonus each time a different combination of attributes is used until all possible combinations have been used.<br/>10. Be very strict during character creation so you don't have to be later.<br/>11. Let people redefine their traits when the fail / grow bored of them.<br/>12. Make sure that opponents are likely to be susceptible to the traits.<br/>13.

I like solutions three and five myself: not only should a player be man enough to keep inappropriate players in line, but the game should also be constructed in such a manner as to support and encourage play wherein players only try to make their characters win when and in a manner that is appropriate for the game's goals. Both of these are fine things: something is wrong in a game if players can't intervene when others play against the purpose, and something is also wrong if the players are focusing on winning too much or in a wrong manner.<br/><br/>To wit: if a player wins all conflicts by using his "Swordfighting" even when that trait is a bad choice, isn't the problem with the player who wants to win so much that he's willing to break the rules and use traits inappropriately to win? And if the problem is in the player, isn't it then also a problem in the game's structure and the way it is played, if it's making the player behave in this destructive manner?<br/><br/>I think that's a pretty good expression of my fundamental approach on this sort of thing, really. If players are opting to ignore fictional sensibility to win, then those players are a problem, but players are usually only a problem if the system is failing to support them in rightful action. This is a distinctive approach in that while some games very well assume that the players are always trying to win no matter what, and somebody else is responsible for reining them in and making sure that the fiction is respected - even while some games are like that, not all of them are, so adding complex balancing measures might well be a waste of time if the game is otherwise predicated on players not trying to win.<br/><br/>As for how common that sort of thing is, well... The aforementioned Solar System speaks of this in the game text, actually; my philosophy is that striving to win is a separate attitude from advocating a character, with the difference being pretty much that a player in the mental frame of advocacy will, indeed, want to respect the fiction itself with very minor need for external supervision. This is because an advocating player is not actually trying to make his character win, he's just trying to express clearly what the character wants and how he goes about achieving his aims. The player himself does not have a stake in whether character wins or loses, so he has no motivation to compromise the fiction for advantage - he will skip the Swordfighting skill when he deems it inappropriate to the situation, and calmly enjoy the dramatic failure of his character's hopes and dreams.<br/><br/>All of the above is directed at a point, which is that if you constantly have trouble with players making the fiction suffer to make their characters win, then you have one of two possible situations (roughly, there might be others): either you're playing a game that expects players to respect the fiction and they do not for some reason, or you're playing a game that expects the GM to keep the players in line in regards to the fiction, but he is not doing that for some reason. Either case ends up in tears for a roleplayer, who presumably places quite a bit of value on a robust fiction. Neither of these cases actually requires a mechanical fix (although both will benefit of mechanics that distribute the burden of vigilance); the first case is fixed by having the players start respecting the fiction even when it means that their character loses, the second is fixed by having the GM learn to say no.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259221/#Comment_259221" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T06:10:56+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  6:10AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite>5.

For instance, in In a Wicked Age..., you have to specify one or two forms which need to be rolled for your Particular Strength to come into play. That limits when you can use it. In other games, you might have certain categories of these traits which interact in certain ways: type X traits can only be used to oppose type Y traits, say.<br/><br/>Something like that, though, can be added to existing games, too. If you're having trouble with Dogs players narrating their traits into every conflict, you might try assigning an arena to each trait at character creation. So, you would write, "I'm a good shot 2d4 - guns", and "smooth talker 1d10 - talking". It limits the system a little bit, but wouldn't break it or anything, I don't think.<br/><br/>Another potential fix from the design perspective is any system where using traits or abilities also puts those at risk, like the "Use It, Risk It" variant rule for In a Wicked Age..., or the die gamble in The Pool. Yeah, you can roll all your dice (or the high dice), but if you fail, you'll lose them, so choose carefully.<br/><br/>Pool-type mechanics are great in that they allow the players to fiddle with the odds of success but then reward them for setting those odds lower.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
