What about the opposite?  I mean, most games (many games?) now have a sort of "Inspirations" section describing what movies and books inspired the writing of a game.  Eclipse Phase in particular has a really exhaustive list of inspirations.  Are there any films that you've watched purely because you saw them listed in such a section of a game you like / were getting in the mood to play?  If so, what did they change about your attitude towards said game or the playing thereof?<br/><br/>I read Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, for example, because it was listed as a primary idea-generator for FreeMarket.  Reading the book completely opened up the game for me - I "got" it after I read the book.  How about you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271899/#Comment_271899" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-18T14:41:09+00:00" title="May 18, 2010  2:41PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Almost all the sources listed across the various Sorcerer supplements.  I would have never known that I actually liked fantasy fiction if it wasn't for the stuff in Sorcerer &amp; Sword.  In particular Wagner's Kane stories really blew me away (for Sorcerer &amp; Sword) and James Ellroy's L.A. Quartet (for Sorcerer's Soul).<br/><br/>The one exception was my experience with Wicked City from Demon Cops.  It's listed as THE reference for the game but when I watched it I was very confused.  The basic setup matches the Demon Cops ideas but the follow through has very little to do with the setup.  Indeed it carries a very gross and anti-sex message that I'm a little surprised Ron would be so fond of.  So when I talked to Ron about it, I discovered that he got slightly confused when writing up the bibliography and mixed up the setup of Wicked City with the follow through of another film on the list.  Very amusing.  In any event I don't recommend Wicked City at all.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271901/#Comment_271901" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-18T14:55:34+00:00" title="May 18, 2010  2:55PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is funny, Jesse. <br/><br/>I'm trying to think back.

There's nothing <i>damaging</i> about it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jessecoombs</cite>I read and enjoyed the Mouse Guard and Iron Empires comics after reading the game books.</blockquote>\nI read each before I bought the games. While I like Mouse Guard, the comics pale in comparison before the game and the one session I ran of it. Also Iron Empires wasn't that great. I like the game much better, although re-reading the comics after reading and playing the game has jumped them up a notch in my personal rating system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272162/#Comment_272162" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-20T01:31:49+00:00" title="May 20, 2010  1:31AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2010 1:32AM by Tulpa.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm surprised no one has mentioned the excellent film glossary in Dust Devils.

Does that count? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The relentless, every-single-scene approach that movie took to addressing its chief argument - is murder ever justified [which segued into "what is the nature of humanity"] - made me see how front-and-center theme could be. <br/><br/>The Guy Ritchie movies make/made me very excited about designing a True Crime game of some sort, one where factions played a huge role. That could be a part of why I eventually got in on my design <i>La Familia</i> - I had a string of design attempts that focused on the PC-as-group-member (or as Organization Man, if you're into sociology). <br/><br/><i>Dragonslayer</i> felt like better-than-D&amp;D, realized in film. It's got Peter McNichol of <i>Ally McBeal</i> and <i>Numb3rs</i> fame. <i>Willow</i> had a similar effect ^_^ Go, Mad Martigan! You see these archetypes up on the screen, you think about your D&amp;D experiences (mine, anyway), and think Garsh, where'd I go wrong, and how can I go right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
