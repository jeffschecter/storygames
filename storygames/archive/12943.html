Have you not slept in a really long time?  Of course not, would you really want to close your eyes - even for a second - in Ravenloft?  I could see a really cool game where the players are in their typical fantasy setting and after a brutal defeat are kept awake for a long time on a death march to the coal mines.  After a month of travel, the mists move in and they are in another, terrible land.  Will they wake up and find that they are still walking or have they fully transitioned over?  Will they pay for their war crimes?<br/><br/>Alternately, you could use the Jenga towers, ala Dread, to emulate the timing of the mists.  Every action requires a block pull; when the tower falls mists wash in and things are different.  Talk about incentive to complete the evening's adventure!  It would also let you cycle through the holdings of Ravenloft in a whirlwind tour (every time it falls switch holdings).<br/><br/>...or, Use Burning Wheel as a base.  During each phase of the lifepaths, ask questions ala Dread.  Then, in Ravenloft, use the Dread mechanics only when players enter the mist.  Keep playing until there is only one - as players are eliminated, they find themselves on the other side.  The last one in stays in for good but don't tell them that until afterward.  Keep incorporating the tower to provide tension in scenes of horror.  Perhaps each time the tower falls, instead of removing the character, add a point to a newly burned emotional attribute (Dread) - think about the characters slowly becoming fixtures of Ravenloft - slowly losing their beliefs and becoming dead inside (and gaining necromantic powers).  Can they find their way home before they gain a holding of their own?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291679/#Comment_291679" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-05T18:45:12+00:00" title="September  5, 2010  6:45PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What are your ideal Ravenloft game sessions like? <br/><br/>Imagine you experienced the best sessions ever.

The NPCs could start friendly or aggressive and then follow AI tactics just like monsters. If the players treat the person X do Y and so on except don't reveal those details till the end of the scene. The results could be bonus treasures or nasty surprise encounters later on. NPC interactions could also be less about reactions and more about choices. A dark stranger offers you a secret weapon in exchange for draining 1 of your hit points but won't tell you why (you find out later if you agree). Roleplaying would be short, punchy but slightly mechanical to keep in line with the core game.<br/><br/>That said this probably isn't what the OP had in mind.

The meat of the material I've been reading was all about antagonistic monster NPCs like powerful vampires, legendary witches and such, all embroiled in their own epic tragedies. That sort of background is a snap for Solar System, it's probably even a better fit than Planescape (that being another setting from the same era). The only challenge is that I'd need to enable player characters to equal the dark lords in drama so as to keep them in the spotlight, but I suppose that could be done with some clever crunching - give them a mix of horror stuff and D&amp;D-flavoured fantasy hero stuff to build the characters from and presume that nobody is going to <i>be</i> in the Domains of Dread without already being entangled in some last heir of a lost kingdom -type stuff.<br/><br/>The converse of this judgment is that I genuinely wouldn't know what to do with this material in an old-school D&amp;D game. Perhaps there is some more D&amp;D-like Ravenloft material out there (such as the titular 1st edition module, which I've yet to check out), but the 2nd edition stuff I read was all about tragic backstories that wouldn't matter one whit in a dungeon crawl.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291758/#Comment_291758" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-06T07:55:33+00:00" title="September  6, 2010  7:55AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first Ravenloft module and its multi-authored sequel are two of my favorite AD&amp;D modules. What I loved about them were the alternate endings and villain motivations. In I6 Ravenloft, set in the Slavic village of Barovia and its adjacent castle, the vampire might be seeking a bride, or a means of escaping his lands and traveling without fear of sunlight into other kingdoms, or something along those lines. Special weapons or artifacts are likewise hidden in variable locations in his castle, and all of it is framed in a gypsy fortune-telling session early in the adventure. It's brilliant.<br/>\n<br/>\nI10 Ravenloft II: House on Gryphon Hill tells the story of the handsome Alchemist who, in an effort to rid himself of his base and dark nature, creates a room-sized Apparatus powered by lightning to effect this change. However, what happens is that his dark side becomes an entity on its own, the Creature Strahd, aka the vampire from the first module. This module is set in a seaside community taken straight from a Hammer Horror film, with a manor house and even a sanitarium. The heroes awake in the town, having had a horrific dream in which they were fighting a vampire in Barovia. The variable options in this module include the mortal host of the Creature Strahd (it possesses somebody and acts through them, or is occasionally active without a host), the location of the Apparatus, and so on. Plus, as the module continues, a timeline progresses in which townsfolk are slowly having their souls switched out with monsters from around the town, so that the people might actually be gargoyles or wraiths in human form - while the monster bodies have innocent human souls trapped within them. Creepy and awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to me, Ravenloft might hang on the old "explore and kill the monster" tropes of AD&amp;D, but it always seemed to me that it was trying to break out of that and be something else. Brave heroes, dark plots, pervasive horror, and specific motivations and goals abound.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nCam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291779/#Comment_291779" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-06T10:58:53+00:00" title="September  6, 2010 10:58AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I agree with Cam.

Or do you mean a Ravenloft inspired game?  I too have a love for Ravenloft.  But I really don't like the thinly disguised literary figures or the more Hammer-horror elements.  I much prefer the pure Gothic Romance aesthetics.  When I picked up most of the 3E Ravenloft books I began to think, "Man I could totally run this with Sorcerer."<br/><br/>Since then I've refined and run over a half-dozen scenarios set in my Gothic Fantasy Ravenloft inspired setting.  It works beautifully and captured all the dark romantic tragedy and gothic horror I always wanted my Ravenloft games to be.  BUT!  I've never run it "in" Ravenloft as written.  I don't know what would happen if you tried to do a more strict port.  I would suggest it would involve things like at Humanity Zero you become a Darklord with your own domain.  In fact, my ideas started there but I quickly abandoned the strict port in favorite of simply capturing simply what was most inspiring to me about Ravenloft and dumping everything else.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291809/#Comment_291809" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-06T16:18:31+00:00" title="September  6, 2010  4:18PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 6, 2010 4:18PM by nemomeme.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>EDIT - Matthew, could you tell me more about the Savage Worlds Solomon Kane book?  I'm familiar with Howard's stuff a little bit and know what Savage Worlds is, although I don't know much about the system at all or what its strengths are.  Why would you use this for Ravenloft?</blockquote>Most of the Savage World experts I know are recovering from PAX.  I don't know a lot about how Savage Worlds plays, but the feel of Solomon Kane and the era that's covered by the sourcebook is great for vampire/evil hunting.  It's got specific rules catered to dealing with a variety of creatures of the night.  Depending on what kinds of things attract you about Ravenloft, it might be a fit.  Vampires were definitely a recurring adversary for Solomon Kane.  The RPG gives me a similar vibe as did the Van Helsing movie.  Except good.<br/><br/>Savage Worlds is similar in some ways to D&amp;D.  It is focused on action and combat but is faster than most editions of D&amp;D in this regard.  If you're pitching to a group that likes D&amp;D and likes Ravenloft but it's only you that is not enthused about D&amp;D for handling reasons you might consider Solomon Kane.  I'd be choosing it because I'm curious about Savage Worlds and the group that loves Ravenloft doesn't like to stray too far from D&amp;D.  <br/><br/>I own and have only read Conspiracy of Shadows but it seems to me that might be a good fit as well.<br/><br/>I love Solar System.  If you're up for the hacking that would work well too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291811/#Comment_291811" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-06T16:30:19+00:00" title="September  6, 2010  4:30PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fantasy Craft.
