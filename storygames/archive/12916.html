I prefer the term "fiction game" when trying to describe to someone what one is, but look, D&amp;D, Polaris, the Norwegian Style games, Burning Wheel, even M1244 (which is labeled a "story game")--they're all roleplaying games. It's a term we get from history, and no, it doesn't do the best job at defining every single little game in the vast library of games, but it's the term we have and it makes sense for the most part. I think games that try to call themselves something different in an effort to distinguish themselves as distinct from "roleplaying game" are still defining themselves in relation to "roleplaying game", which means, really, that those games are roleplaying games.

It's not about just escaping prejudices.<br/><br/>But the exemple of "Settlers of catan" is a perfect counter-exemple, as it is (or was) THE boardgame to play with non gamers, and tell them "look, it's not at all that sort of of boardgame that last 5 hours.it's simple, fun...let's try". <br/><br/>It's not a pure accident if the term "eurogame" appeared for <i>this kind of boardgame</i>.

Yes, the categories are used for identity politics and cooler-than-thouness, but they're also used to convey useful bits of meaning, too.<br/><br/>To answer the original question, I prefer the most accurate answer depending on what I'm talking about.  These are the denotative meanings of these things in my idiolect:<br/><br/>Indie games are published by the person who wrote them, or by a company owned by that person.  This makes FUDGE and Mouse Guard not indie RPGs, and it makes GURPS and Rifts arguably indie RPGs, but them's the breaks when you taxonomize.  "Indie game" isn't a useful indicator of quality; it's a description of the publishing process.<br/><br/>Small-press games are published in small print runs, usually measured in the hundreds rather than the thousands.  Also not an indicator of quality, also a description of the publishing process.<br/><br/>Story games are RPGs where the rules treat story as primary -- games with a Narrativist agenda rather than a Gamist or a Simulationist one.  The mechanics often concern themselves with pacing: the rules change depending on where you are in the story.  Fiasco is a story game because game play is divided into Acts, and the rules change depending on whether you're in Act 1 or Act 2; and because the mechanics introduce rising action/increasing tension with the Tilt and explicitly handle the denouement. <br/><br/>Roleplaying games are games where a major point of the game is to identify with at least one character and part of the activity involves considering what that character would do and acting out the role.  Arkham Horror is not a roleplaying game, despite players having named characters, because the character histories are just color and don't really affect gameplay.<br/><br/>Experimental games are games that try new things.  If an experimental game succeeds, after a while it stops being new. <br/><br/>These are not all the same thing:  If I recall, Colonial Gothic is an indie game and a small-press game (author-published, small print runs), but not a story game (it uses a modified d20 system, which doesn't take narrative structure into account) or an experimental game (because it's using d20).  None of these should have value judgments associated with them; the problem is that, often, they do -- there's a certain STORY GAMES GOOD, OTHER GAMES BAD mindset that will read that example as me saying that Colonial Gothic is bad because it's not a story game. <br/><br/>So which one I use depends on what I'm looking for.  If I'm in an unfamiliar game store, I'm likely to ask for "the indie games"; if I'm talking about the games I like to play, I'm likely to mention "story games."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290992/#Comment_290992" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T19:52:18+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  7:52PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hans chung-otterson</cite>Oh man, I have no clue why this subject makes me angry; it's pretty stupid and insignificant, but it makes me say things like:<b>Look, they're all fucking roleplaying games</b>.

I think games that try to call themselves something different in an effort to distinguish themselves as distinct from "roleplaying game" are still defining themselves in relation to "roleplaying game", which means, really, that those games are roleplaying games.

It means that the creator o the game is the publisher. When it's produced by several people, they're all in control of the production of the part they created. That means they're answerable only to their own conscience, business plan, and sense of value. The result is that Luke owns and publishes Burning wheel by the thousands and makes his living with it, Vincent publishes Dogs in the Vineyard in batches of several hundred and it pays for the birth of his last child (which, if you don't know, is quite expensive), and Fred et al. Published FATE for free, developing it into a commercial thing only when they'd established a huge fan base.</p>\n<p>What that means is that they have the freedom to create, market, and publish in the ways they see fit because they're not materially answering to anyone but themselves and their players.</p>\n<p>The absurd comment made elsewhere that Luke isn't indie because he's successful is ignorant of both the definition and Luke's trailblazing for indie publishers. He's just where many of us plan to be in several years.  On the other hand, Brad has passed up that freedom to Bad Hat, which makes Diaspora "small press" but not independent.

It is, however, about protagonists and what they'll do to get (or fail to get) that they want and need, so it's pretty story-heavy.</p>\n<p>Isn't Andy's definition of "Story Game" something like, "Role playing games and the things people in 2006 say aren't role playing games that you use to tell stories"? I mean, that says it all to me. I don't care who publishes it. I care about what qualities the play has. I want effective tools to do the stuff the game's about, and I want to know what the game's about, and I want it to be about something I care about. The major distinction is that, when you're appealing to a broad or entrenched audience, it constrains what the game can be about, which means a large publisher is unlikely to make something that appeals to me. But it doesn't mean that any given small publisher makes something I want.</p>\n<p>Like, I don't really like 3:16. A lot of other people do. That's not because there's a problem with the game, but because it's about something that I can't engage in sincerely (I think). It's the same reason I don't like D&amp;D (though frankly, I've had more fun with 3:16).</p>\n<p>I've had a great time playing Mouse Guard, on the other hand, and it's from a medium-sized publisher, written under contract with a designer who had no control over its publishing.</p>\n<p>Philippe, I'm pretty sure you're having a hard time finding a word for that thing because it's several different things that often overlap but don't necessitate each other.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291179/#Comment_291179" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-02T11:07:33+00:00" title="September  2, 2010 11:07AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See, I like indie games because they tend to be more experimental, and because they've often got a clear vision of what they want.  Sometimes their vision is not something I care for, but it's likely to be less diluted than a mass-market game that's trying to appeal to a broad audience.  It's not that I expect that I will like all indie games, but that they will elicit a stronger reaction in me than a mass-market game.  I really like it when that reaction is positive, but it can't always be.  And I find that strongly negative reactions are as interesting to figure out as strongly positive ones; it's the lukewarm ones that bore me.<br><br>I mean, to take two games I got my hands on at about the same time:  I had a pretty strongly negative reaction to 3:16.  But that reaction fascinates me, because it's so strong and visceral.  It's not just a "this is not interesting" reaction; it's a "this is wrong fun" reaction.  Savage Worlds, on the other hand, didn't elicit much of a reaction at all.  You have your stats, your advantages, your disadvantages, your skills.  Why aren't we just doing this in GURPS instead?  So I probably am going to play 3:16 at least once more, to figure out why it pushes that particular button.  I may never play Savage Worlds, just because it's too much like more of the same and because life's just too short.<br><br>And Mouse Guard is also an excellent example.  It's a great game.  It's not small-press or indie, but what does that really matter unless we're trying to play cooler-than-thou status games?                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291213/#Comment_291213" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-02T13:08:03+00:00" title="September  2, 2010  1:08PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I target my language to my audience.<br><br>If a border guard is asking me why I'm entering the US, and I say that I'm going to a convention....

I put up a couple hundred bucks, made back a couple thousand, and its a frickin' game about <em>child endangerment</em>. That uses handfuls of d8s. And cards for character sheets. And beads. I learned a lot of producing it, and that learning went straight into the development of Shock: (Like: if your statistics only work with handfuls of d8s, change the way the game works to use d6s, cards, or something else that doesn't require a major investment in something you really won't use much.)</p>\n<p>Jonathan Walton has produced a bunch of stuff for free, cuz that's how he wants it to work. No one can tell him any different. Jason Morningstar's games are largely about historical events that no one else has heard about, or genres of fiction that aren't currently in the limelight.

All these games are RPGs, because you play the role of a character.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo achieve that goal, the means of design, production and publishing are completely irrelevant, and trying to make a distinction between games based on that is one of the most pointless ideas ever. It's like trying to convince me that a game is better suited to my goals than other because it was written using MS Word instead of OpenOffice, or whatnot. It' absurd.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are role-playing games that you will like, and some others you won't. And it's OK. Also, most "problems" with thaditional RPGs that story-games try to fix are social problems that rulesets won't fix, because reading a game book is not going to turn a dick into a lovable person.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love RPGs. I'm running Call of Cthulhu and I'm running Don't Rest Your Head, and they're the same. GM. Characters. Dice. Conflict. Fun.

You can just group together two or three obvious titles that "belong together," give that group some kind of name, and hey presto -- instant classification, useful for discussing those two or three titles plus any others that share elements with them (in the "it's a bit like a 'foo' game, but without the dice pools" sense).

I'm talking about classifying schools of design.<br/><br/>Another thought on that: RPG Geek does <i>something</i> towards this, what with their tags like "dice pool", "attribute/stat-based", but I don't think tags like that necessarily tell us about the game design; they just tell us what familiar rpg elements were used in the design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

People love that whole us-good/them-evil big picture bullshit and we'll likely never get away from it, but they don't seem to invest quite so heavily in smaller, more focused classifications.<br/><br/>...well, except with music, but putting together small classifications of RPGs probably wouldn't provoke nearly that level of hipster psychosis.  <i>Probably.</i><br/><br/>And if people are right about how grouping similar games together under one term would improve communication and make it easier to tell what games you'd like (the way that grouping similar music together under terms like "jazz" or "country-western" is supposed to), then hey, why not start from the bottom up and try to get the useful terms <i>before</i> the inevitable "The games I like are objectively better than the games YOU like!" screeching kicks in?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292954/#Comment_292954" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-10T22:12:29+00:00" title="September 10, 2010 10:12PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's definitely some value in terms like traditional RPG - games like D&amp;D, GURPS, ST - ones that are essentially skill based and nothing else<br/><br/>then you've got RPGs that have personal relationships as a central focus, and it's more about the PCs interacting than a party vs the world paradigm, so the focus of the game is more like a soap opera<br/><br/>to avoid the problem of calling it trad vs non-trad you could use terms like "Adventure RPG", "Soap Opera RPG", "Collaborative RPG" (for games like Shock)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12916/how-do-you-name-that-thing" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12916/how-do-you-name-that-thing" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12916/how-do-you-name-that-thing/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12916%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12916%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
