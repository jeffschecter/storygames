We agreed to give <i>Grey Ranks</i> a whirl and then head into <i>Nine Worlds</i>.  Should be fun.  So, last Friday, we fired up <i>Grey Ranks</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know, <i>Grey Ranks</i> is a GMless RPG set during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, where the Polish resistance forces unsuccessfully tried to liberate their capital from their German invaders.  You play teens in the Grey Ranks, which is essentially the underground Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of Poland, which had been outlawed in the wake of the German invasion of 1939.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou cannot change the course of history; Warsaw will still fall.  Instead, the game uses the Warsaw Uprising as a setting for coming-of-age stories about these teen characters.  I told Crystal that <i>Grey Ranks</i> is a romance story set in a war zone.  She looked at me funny, but I was being serious.  <i>Grey Ranks</i> is not about the war; it\u2019s about the effects of the war.  That makes all the difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Players and Dramatis Personae</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThank God for names lists!  Between the lists in the book and the Story Games Names Project, I felt like we had enough to work with.  Here\u2019s what we came up with:<br/>\n<br/>\nSeth\u2014Lech Dabrowska (\u201cGigant\u201d) from Wola.<br/>\nAge: 16<br/>\nThing held dear: his First Love, symbolized by a locket with his girlfriend\u2019s picture.<br/>\nReputations:  Slow Thinker, Brutal<br/>\nStarting Grid Location:  D4<br/>\n<br/>\nRalph\u2014Henryk Leska (\u201cPlug\u201d) from Wola<br/>\nAge: 15<br/>\nThing held dear:  his Family, symbolized by his brother\u2019s shoes<br/>\nReputations:  Reckless, Unreliable<br/>\nStarting Grid Location:  B2<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith\u2014Jerzy Teska (\u201cLeon\u201d) from Old Town<br/>\nAge: 16<br/>\nThing held dear: his Faith, symbolized by St. John\u2019s Cathedral<br/>\nReputations:  Coward, Na\xefve<br/>\nStarting Grid Location:  B4<br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal\u2014Krysha Zwolinski (\u201cOla\u201d) from Old Town<br/>\nAge: 15<br/>\nThings held dear:  her Friends, symbolized by her journal<br/>\nReputations:  Mean, Bossy<br/>\nStarting Grid Location:  D2<br/>\n<br/>\nI noted to everyone that you don\u2019t <b>have</b> to start on different Grid locations, but we did.  In fact, Ralph assigned me D4.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yeah, I ended up with the big kid, a brooding loner with the heart of a romantic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m playing myself.  How do I get stuck in these situations?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Session 1:  Resistance</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Chapter 1:  Monkey-wrenching the Occupation</i><br/>\n<br/>\nGameplay is divided into Chapters.  Chapter 1 is actually a special prologue Chapter, similar in concept to <i>Dogs in the Vineyars</i> initiations, where you\u2019re fleshing out your character.  In <i>Grey Ranks</i>, your accomplishments aren\u2019t random.  Rather, this is an opportunity to get a feel for your character and to do some basic exposition of your character\u2019s personality.  Things Held Dear and Reputations are selected <i>after</i> Chapter 1, so you definitely want to showcase who you are so that this last step of character development goes well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, at the beginning of each Chapter, someone at the table reads the Radio Lightning broadcast from the book, then each player selects a Situation Element from a list.  These are things like \u201cA brother puts his foot down\u201d or \u201cYour parents want to kill me\u201d.  You don\u2019t have to include these in the Chapter; rather, they serve as inspiration for the Chapter ahead.  Chapter 1 has a special list, but, generally speaking, you choose based on your Grid Position.  There are 10 items per list, which ends up taking up a large chunk of the book.   I found these to be <i>really</i> helpful.  Just the process of selecting one for myself got the ideas rolling, but then seeing my selection next to the other players\u2019 selections sparked many ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Chapter 1, our situation elements were:<br/>\n<br/>\nA brother puts his foot down<br/>\nA letter authorizing the bearer to break curfew<br/>\nYour parents want to kill me<br/>\nJerzy Nowicki, softspoken greengrocer who knows everyone<br/>\n<br/>\nThe situation quickly assembled itself.  We were being sent out after dark to retrieve a food shipment from Jerzy, which would then be squirreled away for use by the Resistance at some point in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe each showed our true colors.  Plug was scouting ahead and ran into a German patrol.  He led them on a wild goose chase, eventually leading them into a cellar where dogfights were held.  He released the dogs so that they would attack the Germans.<br/>\n<br/>\nGigant ended up getting the job of carrying the food, since he\u2019s so big.  On the way back, one of the dogs that escaped from the cellar knocked him over, spilling the huge pile that he was carrying.  This frustrated him a great deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeon was mugged by an old Pole who was starving.  Rather than resisting, Leon stabbed the loaf of bread that he was carrying onto the mugger\u2019s knife and then ran off.<br/>\n<br/>\nOla was generally bossy to everyone, ordering people around, even though she had no right to do so.  Then someone beckoned to her from a nearby alley.  It was Hans, a German soldier that she had been dating to irritate her parents.  He wanted to talk, but she blew him off.<br/>\n<br/>\nSigh.  Kids.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118378/#Comment_118378" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-07T18:53:00+00:00" title="January  7, 2008  6:53PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2008 6:54PM by greatwolf.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Grr.

The crew is walking near the German motor pool, when Plug and Stefan (a friend of his) get into an argument about whether or not they could steal a German tank.  Eventually, Stefan double dog dared Plug to do it.  The rest of the crew thought that this would be a good idea.  They\u2019d steal a tank and embarrass the Germans.  High fives all around.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to distract the guards, they started a fight outside the motor pool.  In the chaos and confusion, Plug slipped into the facility and managed to find a tank, already idling.  (Ralph contributed a d4 to the mission pool.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>As he was sneaking toward the tank, Plug remembered the day that his brother left to join the Home Army.  Plug has always idolized his big brother, and he wanted to impress him when he was leaving.  (Goal of the Personal Scene:  impress my older brother).  Ralph succeeded on this roll, so, as John was leaving, he gave Plug \u201cthe talk\u201d about being the man of the house and all that.  Then, as he walked out the door, he turned and winked at Plug.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nTanks are hard to drive, but Plug did his best.  On the way out of the motor pool, he took out one of the guard posts by running it over.  The other members of the crew started to pile onto the tank.  But Leon was stuck out in the open.  As the Germans began to open fire, he ran as quickly as possible for the tank.  Eventually, he grabbed the treads, using them to pull him up onto the tank.  Then Gigant pulled him aboard.  (Keith contributed a d6 to the mission pool.)<br/>\n<br/>\nGigant pulled himself into the tank and started yelling at Plug, who is all over the road.  Then they turned down a side street and found themselves staring down a German roadblock.  \u201cShoot at them!\u201d Plug yelled.  Gigant tried to figure out how to use the main turret.  First he had to get it cranked around.  Then he tried to fire, but it was unloaded.  So he loaded it, got the turret turned around and fired!  (I contributed a d6 to the mission pool.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Gigant struggles with figuring things out that he\u2019s not good at.  So this incident reminded him of last summer, when he spent a few weeks in the country on a farm.  The farmer took him out to the barn, gestured with a grunt, and then left.  Gigant didn\u2019t know what he was supposed to do.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  figure something out and do it right).  I rolled and succeeded, so Gigant was able to figure out that there was a hole in the barn that needed to be repaired, and he was able to do it.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nNow, Ola had a plan.  She wanted to get the tank turned around and go after a German encampment of some kind.  Do some damage!  Make the Germans sorry!  Crystal contributed a d4 to the mission pool, and Ralph rolled.<br/>\n<br/>\nFailure.<br/>\n<br/>\nYep, target number of 12 and we <i>failed</i>.  This was actually pretty funny at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Plug turned down a normal alley shortcut and got the tank stuck.  German forces were on alert, converging on our position, so Gigant put his foot down.  Time to go.  The crew abandoned the tank and made their escape.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Later, the crew was receiving a blistering rebuke from Edmund Telakowski, one of their superiors.  Plug was taking the credit for the idea, but Leon really didn\u2019t want to get in trouble.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  pass as much blame as possible to someone else).  Keith rolled and was successful, so Leon managed to come out look least bad of anyone in the crew.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, Hans came and confronted Ola.  He had been one of the guards at the motorpool, and he had recognized them.  So now he was blackmailing Ola.  Either she goes out with him or he will inform on them.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  make sure no one finds out I\u2019m dating a German).  Crystal rolled and was successful, so she kept this secret\u2026for now.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of the Chapter, we adjusted our Grid positions, and Ralph singled out Gigant.  Why, you ask?  Because that would put Gigant into E5, the \u201csuicidal depression\u201d corner.  I\u2019m playing a Goth Pole in World War II.  Great.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, Gigant has now taken one step towards leaving the game forever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118377/#Comment_118377" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-07T18:53:29+00:00" title="January  7, 2008  6:53PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2008 6:54PM by greatwolf.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Chapter 3:  The Uprising Begins</i><br/>\n<br/>\nWe decided to make Crystal the mission leader for this one.  So she told us that our mission was a courier trip.  Polish partisans in another part of the city needed a weapons delivery, and we were the ones for the job.<br/>\n<br/>\nSituation Elements:<br/>\n<br/>\nSome home-made vodka in shampoo bottles, terrible tasting but potent<br/>\nAn \u201cabandoned\u201d German tank, booby-trapped with explosives<br/>\nSomeone is lying and she is believing<br/>\nA German-only theater in City Center<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Before we were given our mission, Plug took his personal scene.  He and Stefan are outside the command post, drinking this home-made vodka and spinning \u201cexaggerated\u201d war stories for the girls who are nearby.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  make out with one of the girls.)  Ralph rolled and was successful, so Plug copped a feel before being called in for his orders.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nEdmund Telakowski gave the crew its marching orders.  They were to deliver several crates of weapons to a group of Polish partisans on the other side of town.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the route is through the sewers, but there\u2019s a stretch where the crew has to cross an open plaza.  When they get there, they find German soldiers forming up in the plaza, preparing to counter-attack a Polish position down the street.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Gigant and Ola are watching from the sewer entrance, waiting for the Germans to leave.  In the meantime, in the back of the group, Stefan and Plug are getting crazy again.  (Ralph contributes a d10 to the mission pool.)  \u201cI\u2019ll bet we could take those Germans ourselves.\u201d  \u201cYeah, we have all these weapons.\u201d  They soon talked themselves into it.  Grabbing a couple of submachine guns, they burst from the sewers and opened fire on the Germans.  A couple went down, but the Germans quickly reorganized themselves and opened fire.  Plug got under cover.  Stefan wasn\u2019t so lucky.  He was transfixed by gunfire, body jerking before he fell backwards into the sewer.  \u201cRun!\u201d Gigant yelled.  The Germans charged forward.  One of them fired a Panzerfaust down the sewer, but the crew was clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what a shambles.  Some of the weapons crates were lost, and Stefan was dead.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>At this point, Gigant turned on Plug.  He jacked him up against the wall and began smashing him into it, over and over again.  Plug vomited cheap vodka all over Gigant.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  get control of himself before injuring Plug.)  I rolled and failed.  So Gigant went berserk on Plug.  It was only through Ola\u2019s intervention that Plug wasn\u2019t hurt worse than he was.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nOla took charge and started barking orders.  The crew formed up and tried an alternate route to their rendezvous point.  (Crystal contributed a d6 to the mission pool.)  So they cut through the burned-out ruins of the Jewish ghetto.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs they got closer, Ola sent Leon on ahead to scout the area ahead.  He slipped up and made sure that the coast was clear.  (Keith contributed a d4 to the mission pool.)  All clear.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Flashback.  It\u2019s four years ago, and Leon and Ola are playing hide-and-seek.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  impress Ola with his hiding skills.)  Keith rolled and was successful.  So Ola remembered how well Leon had hid in the past.  That\u2019s probably why she trusts him now with the scouting duties.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nThe last stretch of the trip involves crossing an open sewer.  It\u2019s not big, but it\u2019s deep enough to be a problem.  So Gigant finds himself hip-deep in sewage, passing weapons boxes and people from one side of the sewer to the other.  (Seth contributes a d6 to the mission pool.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dice are rolled; success!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe crew gets the weapons to the undergunned partisans that they were resupplying.  With the extra weapons, the partisans are able to drive back their German opponents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Last week, Ola went on a date with Hans.  He brings her some beautiful clothes to wear, takes her to a nice restaurant, and even slips her into a German-only theater.  She hasn\u2019t seen a movie in years, and her resolve is beginning to waver.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  resist falling for Hans.)  Crystal rolled and was successful.  So, despite Hans\u2019 best efforts, he wasn\u2019t able to win over Ola.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nWe adjusted our Grid positions, and Crystal singled out Gigant to make sure that he got a better die for the next Chapter.  But that meant that Leon slid into Nervous Breakdown, visiting a corner for the first time.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrid positions at the end of Chapter 3:<br/>\n<br/>\nGigant:  E3<br/>\nPlug:  A3<br/>\nLeon:  A5<br/>\nOla:  C3                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118380/#Comment_118380" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-07T19:05:54+00:00" title="January  7, 2008  7:05PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Post Game Reflection</b><br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying this game was odd.  There\u2019s some specific constraints within the game, and yet, much of it feels almost freeform.  I\u2019ve not actually played <i>The Shab-al-Hiri Roach</i>, but from what I can tell, this is a feature of that game as well.  So, maybe this is a Morningstar hallmark.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn particular, the GMless nature of the game is a little hard to grok at first.  There aren\u2019t actually assigned roles in the game, unlike <i>Polaris</i> or <i>Dirty Secrets</i>, so you need to be able to shift rapidly between playing your character and doing GM duty for everyone else.  At first, I was looking for more structure to guide this transition, but as the game went on, I became more comfortable with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also found the lack of guidance about a \u201cscene\u201d to be challenging.  Personal scenes make sense, because they are usually self-contained.  But how much action goes into a mission scene?  The best answer, obviously, is \u201cabout one quarter of all the action in the mission\u201d, but that can be hard to feel out in the middle of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I found the beginning of the game to require some heavy lifting to get things moving.  This may have just been my own problem, but I found myself groping at the beginning of the game for stuff to narrate.  Not surprisingly, as the game moved on, this became easier, because we had created material that we could then reincorporate.  It\u2019s like pushing a car; it\u2019s hard to get started but, once it\u2019s rolling, it\u2019s easy to keep it moving.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don\u2019t think that this is a knock against <i>Grey Ranks</i>; I\u2019ve felt the same when starting a game of <i>Polaris</i>.  Also, I had the additional pressure of teaching a game that I wanted the rest of the group to like, so perhaps my attention was divided up a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, to be fair, the game has several tools to help you get things moving, both at the beginning of the game and for each Chapter.  The Radio Lightning introduction to each Chapter and the situation elements are really helpful to provoke inspiration.  I\u2019m glad that these were left as inspiration and not mechanically enforced somehow.  I think that this would have been distracting.  Instead, they are just allowed to be grist for brainstorming, which is really cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also really enjoyed the mission die mechanic.  I remember being somewhat skeptical when I first heard about it, but seeing it in play made me a believer.  After all, you generally want to succeed at your missions, right?  So you want to contribute big dice to the mission pool.  But how big?  If you give dice that are <i>too</i> big, you\u2019re just guaranteeing massive amounts of tragedy.  So, maybe you just contribute a d8 instead of a d10 and hope for a good roll.  But will that be enough?  A delightful tension.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m also coming to see how the Grid messes with the apparent simplicity of winning or losing scenes.  After all, maybe you\u2019re in a place where winning the mission will push you into a corner for the second time.  Or, to pick an example from our game, if Keith had lost his personal scene in Chapter 3, he wouldn\u2019t have ended up in the corner.  I think that it will become important for the players to learn to read the Grid to be able to make the best possible strategic choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one has yet exposed their Thing Held Dear.  I came close, though.  If we hadn\u2019t won the mission in Chapter 3, I would have ended up in Derangement in E1.  So I was prepared to do what had to be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs are we all.

She also actually prefers historical stories to crazy fantasy games, so this works.<br><br>Instead, she doesn't really go for the bleak tragic story.  So, I think that's what it was.  Maybe.  After all, she's the one who's really been agitating to play <i>Steal Away Jordan</i>.  That's <b>her</b> number one GenCon pick.  So, maybe I'm totally not getting a read on her right now.  It happens from time to time.<br><br>The whole "romance in a war zone" was my attempt to 1) boggle her mind a bit and 2) show the possibilities beyond just being a story about people shooting at each other.<br><br>Seth Ben-Ezra<br>Great Wolf                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118597/#Comment_118597" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T13:57:53+00:00" title="January  8, 2008  1:57PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, gotcha.
