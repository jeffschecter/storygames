That'll work! Use him." And then I come up with this really cool idea of him working for the mad gods of chaos, who pay him in qualitative money. It functions on qualities, not quantities, dig?<br/><br/>Caleb (the gunslinger) ain't a believer. Not many people are, dig? He's hired by the mad gods through an intermediary, who might be insane. But the money works, and that's the important part. The job is to kill a list of 23 people. Some of them appear to be for political reasons, but no clear agenda is apparent from the combination of them.<br/><br/>So, here's the thing. You aren't a believer, you just need the money, so why'd you make a deal with the mad gods?

So Blood is Red...do bad things happen if you try to buy "blood" with Red Coins instead of Blood Coins? (as an example).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here's my thought for Caleb:  What makes him completely totally utterly unemployable?  You may need to pair this with a time crunch so there isn't time for him to simply redeem himself and then seek more normal employment.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) the only thing he's good at is killing...but he's earned a reputation for betraying his employers so now none wll hire him.  But he really needs the money.  Strange how this guy doesn't seem to mind his untrustworthy rep...<br/>\n<br/>\n2) all killing must be licensed by the Blood Guild.  War, murder, butchering livestock...if you don't have a license...you're not allowed to kill (I think whatever magical effect surrounds this would tie in well with qualitative money magic).  If you kill or employ an unlicensed killer...you're in deep.  Caleb lost his license...falling out with the guild leader...whatever...now he's a killer without a license...who would possibly be mad enough to hire him and face the wrath of the Blood Guild.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) he's bored...dillusioned...a bit mad himself.  His whole life has been shown to be a meaningless exercise in pointless blood shed and now he's just looking to die.  But just dieing, or killing himself, or letting himself be killed is a one way ticket to hell...only going out legitimately on-the-job gets him into Valhalla.*  So here's some crazy dude wanting to hire him for not just one damn near impossible job...but 23.  Who cares if the coin is wierd...death is almost certain...sign him up.<br/>\n<br/>\n*or if he's not a believer in anything...he wants to make sure his name lives on in infamy after he's gone...which won't happen if he goes out with a wimper...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224293/#Comment_224293" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T12:55:40+00:00" title="August 12, 2009 12:55PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The money is magic, and thus not totally reliable.

But I'm putting a spin on chaos. What the mad gods are all about is the continual opening up of new avenues and opportunities -- constant evolution. <i>Structure</i> is not necessarily an issue, as long as we're talking about structures that are unpredictable, changeable, influenceable. They are against recursiveness, repetition, and dead ends. (A clockwork universe that eventually winds down, that's what the one god of order wants; the mad gods want a universe that is perpetually changing, moving, evolving.)<br><br/>I saw quantitative money as something representative of order, so I gave the mad gods money that works on qualities. With one Lead Coin, you could buy a million bullets, if you did it all at once. The stipulations on spending qualitative money are nil to those with imagination, and spending it opens things up to all sorts of interesting upsets.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224310/#Comment_224310" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T13:25:53+00:00" title="August 12, 2009  1:25PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should look into potlatch economies, like the one used by the Tlingit/Tsimshian/Haida complex.

The mad gods are just the fastest route available.<br/><br/>* You are suicidal, and cherish the thought that any deal with the mad gods can only end badly for you -- and this particular end appeals to you more than a more mundane one.<br/><br/>* You are a gambling addict, and like all gambling addicts you think it's the potential jackpot that keeps you coming back -- but it's not, of course.  It's the thrill of the loss that makes gambling so addictive, and dealing with the mad gods is the purest fucking rush you will ever find...once you play their game you will never want to play any other.  Everyone keeps telling you to stop and save yourself, but they'll never understand that <i>you can't.</i><br/><br/>* You know (or think you know) a loophole that will let you walk away from the deal unscathed, making you one of the lucky few who scammed the mad gods and got away with it scot-free.<br/><br/>* They are the only ones willing to deal with you: you have alienated all the mortal kings and fiefdoms, been spurned by all the holy, been rejected by all the demons, and it is only the mad gods who will still acknowledge you -- and you don't even know why.  But it's the only offer left on the table, and you have no choice but to take it.<br/><br/>* You were lied to and manipulated by the mad gods:  you were not aware that they were actually the ones you made your deal with until it was too late.  Now they not only won't let you out of your contract, they will inflict punishments upon you if you do not continue to deal with them.<br/><br/>* You are unable or unwilling to recognize that the mad gods are very real; you think that the powers you have gained are yours and yours alone, that the believers who led you to them are deluded fools, that the ancient texts are the addled scribblings of drug fiends and lunatics.  You think that your worldly cynicism shields you, that you are the only man in the world who sees things as they truly are.  It amuses the mad gods to let you dig your grave in this way, for it will make your shattered psyche taste all the sweeter when they come to claim it.<br/><br/>* You have done terrible things, and sought out the aid of the mad gods not only to get the power to try and make up for your sins, but also because you feel the doom they will inevitably lay upon you is a fitting and just punishment for you.<br/><br/>* You were raised in service to the mad gods.  It is the only life you have ever known, and they have decreed that it is the only life you shall ever know.<br/><br/>* <i>All of the gods are mad gods.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224389/#Comment_224389" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-12T20:07:00+00:00" title="August 12, 2009  8:07PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe he does believe in the mad gods?

Even if the coin works on a metaphorical level, which is going above and beyond the notion of quality, there's nothing uniquely identifying about being <i>a</i> blood relative.  Everybody has them.  So there's no telling who the Blood coin would buy back, even if it did somehow manage to bring a person back from the dead.  More likely, the merchant or shaman or whoever would try to slit your own throat, since that is the easiest way to produce the blood of someone related to you.  I expect qualitative coins are most safely used when you want to buy a commodity, where it doesn't matter <i>which</i> thing you get as long as it is the right <i>kind</i> of thing.  It's trying to be specific that gets people in trouble.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224903/#Comment_224903" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-16T07:17:02+00:00" title="August 16, 2009  7:17AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            so he would need a sister coin and a life coin (presuming he had only one sister) ]perhaps a blood coin to get a sister who is a blood relative??? <br/><br/>This idea of qualitative money is interesting, did you want to keep posting here by what you meant by it , or would you like to start a new thread with more examples.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224912/#Comment_224912" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-16T10:31:53+00:00" title="August 16, 2009 10:31AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>so he would need a sister coin and a life coin (presuming he had only one sister) ]perhaps a blood coin to get a sister who is a blood relative???</blockquote>\nI think you can count on a sister being a blood relative!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224918/#Comment_224918" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-16T12:54:05+00:00" title="August 16, 2009 12:54PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, unless the gods are going to screw with you.<br/><br/>And the first thing you should learn when you want to make a deal with the gods is that the gods are <i>always</i> going to screw with you.

My idea is that Caleb has to give the money to someone who is a.) a merchant, and b.) exhibits some sign of the Taint of the Mad Gods. The transaction occurs instantly, magically, and sometimes without conscious awareness on behalf of the merchant, depending on how much of the Taint he has (the more Taint, the more likely he's aware of it).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JuddG</cite>As I understand it, one Blood coin would buy him back a blood relative, right?</blockquote>\nThe odds are waaaay stacked against him.<br/>The resolution mechanic I'm using for this works with a dice pool, counting "hits" with 50% chance of a hit on each die. Compared to this, you have Obstacles, each of which must be addressed by "spending" a hit in order for the action to succeed. In addition to that, you have Dangers, which you may address by spending a hit to prevent them, or you can let them happen to use your hits elsewhere. Sometimes you might fail the action just to prevent a nasty danger.<br/><br/>So, basically, with the coins, what we've got going on is Dangers. The less specific your coinage, the more the Dangers. Trying one Blood coin to buy your sister back is gonna come with a fuck-ton of Dangers.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite>And if you do get your sister back, her big brother turns out to be a jobless, penniless drifter with blood on his hands.<br/><br/>Sis is gonna love that.</blockquote>\nThis is really a good idea.<br/><br/>I hit upon the idea that his sister was also a shootist. It's in the family, a very serious thing. They had to learn to <i>think</i> guns before they were ever allowed to touch one.  Then they had to build their own. Caleb's is made from the wood of the handle of a meat ax, and steel made from the core of a meteorite. Lorelai's (his sister) is made from the wood of an oak branch knocked down by lightning, and steel made from the scrap of a 750 Norton.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Benhimself</cite>Of course, there's also the interesting wrinkle that anybody you buy something from now has (at least) one of these coins.

And if there are other players, how are the other players and their PCs going to fit in with Caleb's deal, the assassinations, and/or the collection of the qualitative coins?<br/><br/>I'm wondering this because similar setups have come up in our games from time to time: one character is a special snowflake with a personal quest driving him or her, and the other PCs have a hard time being part of it.  Maybe they don't have the right abilities to contribute much to it, maybe it's a story they don't have any reason to care about (beyond the usual "PCs stick together" habit), maybe the special snowflake actually pushes them away from it ("no one must ever know my terrible secret").  At its worst, no one is happy -- the player of the special snowflake feels like the thing he cares about isn't getting enough attention, the players of the other PCs feel like it's getting too much.  Nowadays we try to spot the problem before it starts and make an effort to adjust the concept and the characters so that everyone can feel like they're an important part of that plot right away, but I'm always interested in learning how to do that <i>better</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226331/#Comment_226331" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T14:14:41+00:00" title="August 20, 2009  2:14PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite>You had something about a list of people he needed to kill for the Mad Gods?

I don't have to be a protagonist to have fun (and, as an aside, the Rustbelt is designed so that players have that option). But I don't know how other people feel about it; I've never asked them to do it.<br/><br/>To address other possible questions about the game itself:<br/>I'm basically coming up with the 23 hits as I go. The first one is a guy named Hammurabi Musashi, and he's basically the king of half of New Mexico. Yep, that's the kind of game this is.<br/><br/>Other than the resolution mechanic, the rest of the system is like this:<br/>PCs are defined by 4 attributes, which you define yourself, and assign 16 dice between (Caleb's are Calm, Trouble, Outrage, and Eye). You usually roll one attribute at a time, but you can do "helper rolls" like in Sorcerer, where hits on a preparatory action are rolled over as bonus dice into the "real" action. You can also gain dice by risking equipment and relationships -- if the dice gained from them miss, you lose what you risked.<br/><br/>NPCs never roll dice. They act solely by pushing PCs into action, and/or introducing Dangers and Obstacles.<br/><br/>There's a system of Conditions, which work like Cruel Fortunes in Poison'd: one bad thing gives me, the GM, the right to introduce new kinds of bad things (i.e. Obstacles and Dangers). Conditions are inflicted through Dangers; I'll basically be making them up on the fly, explaining the ramifications of each as I announce it as a Danger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226333/#Comment_226333" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T14:23:51+00:00" title="August 20, 2009  2:23PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and I think it'd be really cool if he gets his sister resurrected fairly quickly, then breaches the contract before he's killed all 23 people.
