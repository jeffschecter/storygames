I realized I needed to clean up my draft before sending it to him and by the time I had done that I realized I could probably share it with everyone, so here it is.<br/><br/>It's a (slightly humorous, although that might not be immediately obvious) take on the gothic/mystery/horror/monster hunting genre in the vein of Sleepy Hollow, Brotherhood of the Wold and Brothers Grimm. I'm calling it a Beta, because it might be that more actual play (I just ran a little bit of it) will reveal some glaring flaw in the design, but if not I think it's pretty much a full, playable game.<br/><br/>You can get it here: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/24592325/Blood%20in%20the%20Mist%20%28Beta%29.pdf" rel="nofollow">Download</a>, or over on my blog in the downloads section.<br/><br/>If someone plays it, I hope you have fun and let me know how it went!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359767/#Comment_359767" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-15T09:10:38+00:00" title="February 15, 2012  9:10AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm just glad there's still love out there for <i>Brotherhood of the Wolf</i>.

It's already gotten points for the <i>Brotherhood of the Wolf</i> and <i>Vidocq</i> shout-outs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TheOtherTracy" title="TheOtherTracy"><img alt="TheOtherTracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/711/nUY8JIY0C5ZHL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TheOtherTracy">TheOtherTracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359769/#Comment_359769" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-15T09:33:48+00:00" title="February 15, 2012  9:33AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On a quick once-over, it seems like a cool set of concepts, and seems well-executed. I'd enjoy playing it, I think, and would want to experience it in play to really be sure of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
