Maybe some of you can help me make a better system choice.<br/><br/>I've build a huge megadungeon to for a rotating cast of players. We're talking possibly several groups, casual gaming, rotating party membership. The dungeon is sprawling and chaotic; not a nicely organized series of escalating challenges, but rather a dynamic world to explore (and possibly get killed in).<br/><br/>I need the system to support challenge-based play, exploration, and quick character generation. I also want to keep my own prep under control and be able to craft encounters on the fly when needed. There needs to be a balance between deadliness and survivability. Keeping a character alive long enough to get to the bottom needs to be challenging, but possible. A game that provides resolution for more than just combat (i.e., skills, stunts, and so on) is a plus.<br/><br/>Here are pros and cons of some of the systems I've considered. <br/><br/>Basic D&amp;D: a familiar system to me, and fast to play, but I'm annoyed that it caps of lvl 3 and doesn't seem to flow directly to expert edition. I'm tired of grafting non-combat resolution onto Basic D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Warhammer Fantasy Role-Play: a favorite of mine, but I'm not sure how well it's suited to dungeon play. Will encounters play out quickly enough?<br/><br/>T&amp;T: I barely know this system, but it does have some sort of stunting system. Where do I buy this? The editions have me confused<br/><br/>Labyrinth Lord et. al.: There are a bunch of retro D&amp;D clones, but which ones should I look at? Is this just Basic D&amp;D in a new package?<br/><br/>AD&amp;D and StWT both have a fair bit of player resistance, so I'm not going to use either.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197191/#Comment_197191" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T10:55:19+00:00" title="March 16, 2009 10:55AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been having similar system anxieties during the last year, and I'm pretty sure that I'm much more neurotic about the system than is healthy. From my viewpoint Tunnels &amp; Trolls is almost perfect: I just need to remove the weapons and armor from the relative spotlight they have in combat effectiveness, and the system does practically everything I'd want it to. The edition doesn't matter much if you're willing to houserule - they're 90% identical anyway.<br/><br/>I ultimately ended up constructing my own, simplified version of D&amp;D from scratch to make sure the game doesn't have any rules that cause me allergic reactions. I've done this before, happens every time I start a major fantasy campaign.<br/><br/>The retro-clones are, as the name implies, clones - they're practically the same as the original games, so if neither D&amp;D nor AD&amp;D works for you, then those are unlikely to. If the only problem with basic D&amp;D is the level cap, try the Cyclopedia edition - it's the only complete edition of the game that combines all levels into one book. (Of course, the D&amp;D clone game does that as well - Labyrinth Lord might have been that one, unless it's the AD&amp;D clone. Can't keep them apart.)<br/><br/>If I had to use a published game for a megadungeon, at this point I'd probably go for either T&amp;T (5% houserules), Mazes &amp; Minotaurs (15% houserules), basic D&amp;D (25% houserules) or 4th edition D&amp;D (intent overturned, 10% houserules). The latter would need to have the shit shaken out, but it's not like that's impossible to achieve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197194/#Comment_197194" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T11:00:16+00:00" title="March 16, 2009 11:00AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, is there a reason you need fast character creation if there will be downtime for players due to multiple groups?

This is why I don't consider WFRPG a very ideal option for this sort of thing, while T&amp;T works rather well; ideally the game allows you to develop the details of the character in play after randomizing some fun and flavourful broad strokes at the beginning.<br/><br/>A good question, anyway, and if the game has some way of using the work you committed by creating a detailed character even if that character dies in the first battle, then there's no problem. I could imagine some sort of mechanized thing wherein all traits of the character spin off and become new content when the character dies and stops keeping them together. Could even have funeral scenes or whatnot. A morbid game certainly, if it's going to have both high mortality rates and deep characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197212/#Comment_197212" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T12:34:51+00:00" title="March 16, 2009 12:34PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I had to run such a thing tomorrow, I'd play a Mouse Guard hack.

Perhaps that would suit your needs, or perhaps it's not crunchy enough.<br/><br/>Edit: And if you do want crunchy, old school feel with lots of good combat and relatively quick character and encounter creation, you might as well go with 4E.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197216/#Comment_197216" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T12:40:45+00:00" title="March 16, 2009 12:40PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, just because 4e and 3e are popular doesn't mean they're bad.

The Challenger gets a budget for a given run, and when it's done, you're out, so it keeps drops focused on doing what you need to do in the dungeon itself, and chargen goes pretty lightning fast.

It's only there so the Antagonist can brag about how little she spent to kick the PC's asses. You can remove the Strife limits and it plays fine. If you <i>also</i> remove the "can't die yet" thing that the Greek-style heroes have (their Fate track) then you might want to still use the Strife numbers as a guideline to judge how deadly a challenge will be.<br/><br/>Tony: WFRP combat is pretty simple and easy. It played fast in our games, but we didn't use every last maneuver (or a battle map). Dyson is right that healing is pretty slow. By the rules, you need a few days at the very least to recuperate between battles. This would be very easy to tweak, though, simply changing "days" to "hours" or whatever suits you. Also, WFRP is unpredictable, damage wise. You don't have the gradual chipping away of hit points. Because of the open-ended damage die, you can have sudden deadly wounds on any given round of a fight (often with grisly critical hits that maim and dismember).

Of course, in the Moldvay edition, this option is tucked away in the back of the book (page B60, if you're curious) in the "Dungeon Mastering as a Fine Art" section, so it's easy to overlook or forget.

Characters are more fragile in that game over the long haul but if you have smart players and access to healing it can be done. WFRP does not work that well, you mow through fate points and then wounds and then it's over. Better than Runequest though (ducks).<br/>\n<br/>\nT&amp;T; does work but one thing to be noted about T&amp;T; is that it actually formalizes the 'in and out' of dungeoneering by not allowing any healing in the dungeon except through magic. This codifies the resource management challenge and forces players to think about how much they want to bite off at one go. This can work with a megadungeon but it's a conscious decision to play this way - camping out on level 13 gets a lot tougher unless you allow 'fake outs' at the end of sessions or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would just have people roll stats and house rule everything, but if you wanted some sort of baseline ruleset, S&amp;W;: White Box Edition (not the regular one) is the most minimal set of D&amp;D; rules currently in print; therefore also the best because there's less you have to change as opposed to just add.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of current systems I'm honestly sort of drawing a blank. 3e and 4e 'can do it' of course but there's a lot of non-modular record keeping.

The Ability Saves with player's getting their Intent. <br/><br/>exploration<br/>Not specifically dealt with but can be house ruled to impose time constraints and also dwindling supplies.<br/><br/>quick character generation <br/>Also easy and in fact I think the game is meant to be played with a stable of characters.<br/><br/>Also a quote from Ron Edward<br/>"T&amp;T wants nothing to do with verisimilitude - it's all about strategy. You've got attributes, weapons, armor, and spells. Fighting's all about what weapon and armor you've got (attribute dependent), magic is all about your Strength resources. Effectiveness is all about your Strength, Dexterity, and Luck.<br/><br/>Levels just add to your attributes. Money pays for more spells, more armor, and more weapons. (That's right, never mind "learning" spells. Buy them. Get over it.) Your characters will die, probably. Make up a few and make sure that the dead characters' maps make it topside so your new ones can use them.<br/><br/>What makes all of this more interesting than a mere statistical grind is what the rules call, in their 1979 blessed innocence, "Saving Rolls." They are not frigging Saving Rolls - they are attribute checks. You have seven attributes and the Saving Roll rules apply all the time, in the most open-ended, mind-bogglingly flexible task resolution system ever.<br/><br/>Let me illustrate - my li'l 2nd level fighter stares in horror at the balrog. If we use the Weapon + Adds vs. Monster Rating method (the standard system), my character gets roasted and eaten post-haste. But I can come up with any strategic action, base it reasonably off any attribute that makes sense, and the GM will assign me a "Saving Roll" at some difficulty level. If I make it, we just ignore the combat system and carry on with whatever I wanted to do. Maybe my character jumps onto the balrog's head and then hops off behind him (DEX). Maybe he suddenly sells him a used sword (IQ). Maybe it's a chick balrog and ... (CHR).<br/><br/>Way before "raises" in L5R. Way before skill checks and skill lists. Way before so-called free-form role-playing or any silliness about roll/role. It's all right there.<br/><br/>[In our game], the hobbit character made a DEX "saving roll" during a fight scene, in hopes of slicing a hand off a foe, at the player's request. She succeeded. During the next round, the player stated that the character *chases the other bandits around with the hand* during combat.<br/><br/>I awarded her another Saving Roll, this one on Charisma, to see if the character was so obnoxious such that the other player-characters got free shots at the bandits. She succeeded.<br/><br/>Dude, this game is ... unspeakably simple (and even bloody-minded), and yet as you play, this incredible secondary system kicks in and you suddenly realize that Amber and Over the Edge had merely re-invented or simply drawn attention to elements of an already-existing wheel ..."<br/><br/><br/>ara<br/><br/>EDIT: Added Ron Edward's quote                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197518/#Comment_197518" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-17T20:44:24+00:00" title="March 17, 2009  8:44PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I came late to the party, but I would suggest some of the same game I see above: \n<ul>\n<li>T&amp;T</li>\n<li>Red Box Hack</li>\n<li>For the PDQ system I would recommend "Questers of the Middle Realms", a dungeon-crawly build of the PDQ system that does a great take on D&amp;D style deities.

I started using the 1d20 system as a house rule off and on back in like 1979 so I certainly don't mind it. That said, I actually like the 'rougher grain' of 1d6 for many applications. The grainier things get with the dice, the more work it is to satisfy people's need for emulation. Arguing for a while and deciding that you get a +1 or +2 on the basis of this and that is to me far preferable to stacking up long lists of small modifiers relative to the dice curve.

For example, the "skills" that get grafted on to the system -- they're basically just a +1d6 bonus on particular actions, right?  Meh.<br/><br/>The mechanical house-rules seem to show up in 5.5 (versus flat 5).  Most of them seem to revolve around the worry of stalemating when dealing with equally-equipped groups with lots of soak, hence Spite and ablative armor.  Do you know of any other 'fixes' that were mechanically-based rather than simply modifications towards AD&amp;D?<br/><br/>I think those, plus something connected to how damage is spread out on a side (a Saving roll to block/protect someone?) sounds like it would be enough to make 5.5 workable without changing it into something completely different.<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197767/#Comment_197767" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-19T08:14:42+00:00" title="March 19, 2009  8:14AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I only own an oooold Italian edition which I believe is based on 5.0 (rather than 5.5), and the 7.5 PDF.<br/><br/>Apart from the aforementioned Spite Damage rule, and the +1d6 "skills" and specialist classes (pretty easy to ignore), other rule modifications standing out are:<br/><br/>- a Wizardry ability, replacing Strength as the "battery" you power spellcasting with. This totally hits dwarf wizards (who uberpwned 5th edition T&amp;T) with a big nerf stick, making elf a more appealing choice, thus fulfilling the post-D&amp;D fantasy genre cliche.<br/><br/>- a quirky and interesting "magical resistance" rule, which relies on the Wizardy ability and is actually <i>the </i>mechanically interesting consequence to including it.<br/><br/>- Experience Points are now spent to increase your Ability scores directly; "Level" is now a function of your Ability scores, making it a useless vestige. A somewhat badly worded rule lets you add your Level to Saving Rolls, but it looks like an afterthought on the designer's part. I'd consider stripping Level from the rules altogether as a houserule... maybe.<br/><br/>That's it. Ah, and the writing of 7.5 is the usual mismatched jumble of rules, setting bits and lame in-character justifications for rules which is sadly typical of fantasy RPGs, as opposed to the "here's a set of guidelines for playing a game" approach of the older edition - which I liked way more.<br/><br/>But don't take me wrong: T&amp;T 7.5 is quite the same game, 99% compatible with older T&amp;Ts, and therefore <b>good</b>. The bundle includes two Bestiary booklets, full of useful ready-made monsters for us lazy GMs. And for people who don't live in the US availability as a PDF (as opposed to a printed book) makes it significantly cheaper.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197781/#Comment_197781" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-19T09:13:30+00:00" title="March 19, 2009  9:13AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really think that it matters much which version of the rules you pick. The differences are really easily house-ruled away. Like the skill stuff - trivial to drop if you feel like it. I'm a big proponent of playing dungeon games with lots of house rules anyway, as the GM needs to feel at home with the rules.<br/><br/>The 5% I'd house rule from T&amp;T if I had to play it tomorrow would pretty much be the races and perhaps some explicit opportunities for controlling the randomness of character development. I'd prefer it if players could do something in-game to fix weak starting ability rolls - this goes for D&amp;D as well, it's just a personal preference. If I had more time to plan house rules, I'd drop the explicit equipment lists and the weapon/armor ability dependencies in favour of some other sources of effectiveness - the weapon fetishes simply don't entice me anymore the way they did fifteen years ago, so I'd rather see less detail on whether your sword is type A or type B. I'd probably also consider switching the ability set for something more interesting while I were at it - T&amp;T abilities are not strongly interrelated into the rules system outside the strength/dexterity pair, so it's pretty easy to put in something you find more fruitful for the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197825/#Comment_197825" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-19T11:25:38+00:00" title="March 19, 2009 11:25AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2009 1:19PM by peccable.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys, this is perfect.<br/><br/>I just ordered a hard-copy of v5.5 (circa 1991), so it should be winging its way to me shortly.  I'll be really curious to read the whole rule-set, as up to now all I've had to go on is the free 'mini' version PDF.<br/><br/>In some pitiful attempt to bring this back around to the OP: Tony, it looks like you really have an embarrassment of riches with regards to systems.    Here's a summary of my experiences, as someone who's been looking for something similar to what you're asking for:<br/><br/>I've tried out RBH, and it wasn't really what I was looking for.  It's hard to quantify this in any meaningful way, but it just didn't fit.  It felt too detailed where I felt it should be abstract and too abstract where I felt it should be detailed.<br/><br/>I've also tried Moldvay D&amp;D and found the combat system (which doesn't have anything like stunts in it) too stilted for my tastes.  From what's been posted here, I'm hoping T&amp;T is closer to what I'm looking for: simple, abstracted combat with lots of freedom for players to narrate in any attempted action they want to try (i.e. stunts).<br/><br/>If you're still curious about Labyrinth Lord (which is, as has been noted, a Moldvay clone), you can get the free e-book <a href="http://www.goblinoidgames.com/ll001.zip" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  I've looked through it and it's a little TOO close to OD&amp;D for my tastes.  Definitely far closer to "Rules, not Rulings" rather than vice-versa.<br/><br/>I've played StWT exactly once and it was definitely fun -- that said, I think it's got too much detail on monster/town design to fit what you're looking for.  Also, the rule set hasn't completely gelled yet (the basic die/card mechanic still seems up in the air).<br/><br/>EDIT: Oh, and just to add to the way-too-many-choices problem, I just recently found out about the English translation of <a href="http://www.dungeonslayers.com/" rel="nofollow">DUNGEONSLAYERS</a> which looks a little crunchy, but interesting...<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197855/#Comment_197855" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-19T13:13:08+00:00" title="March 19, 2009  1:13PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya Peccable,<br/><br/>  I use 5.5 and whatever edition you get definitely toss the skill system (if it's there) and go with the ability saves. <br/><br/>ara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197962/#Comment_197962" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-20T04:35:09+00:00" title="March 20, 2009  4:35AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2009 7:25AM by peccable.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an aside on which T&amp;T rule-set (5.5 or 7.5) is better, Joshua Macy at Tales of the Rambling Bumblers just posted <a href="http://webamused.com/bumblers/?p=952" rel="nofollow">an analysis with 7.5 coming out on top</a>, in his opinion.<br/><br/>There's also a post called <a href="http://webamused.com/bumblers/?p=942" rel="nofollow">4E for Grognards?</a> that I found interesting, particularly pointing out the issue I'd have with using 4E for a campaign like this -- the emphasis on the rule-set defining what you can/can't do, rather than the players' imaginations.<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198148/#Comment_198148" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-21T10:23:15+00:00" title="March 21, 2009 10:23AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            T&amp;T gurus, I need your help!<br/><br/>So we settled on T&amp;T 7.5 for the system. It worked great for a lot of things, but it also left us with a lot of questions. I'm curious how other people have handled them.<br/><br/>WTF is up with race balance? Is there any tactical reason to ever choose to play a human? I'm scratching my head on this one, thinking there must be something I'm missing.<br/><br/>Also, how do you handle the order of operations? If a wizard casts "Hold that pose", does it rob the target of their action this round, or next round? Do you allow players to make an SR to do something crazy in combat, and also fight for the round, or does the SR take the place of the action? For example, if I throw sand in a monster's eyes with an SR roll, do I also get to fight this round? Or is the party on their own without my attack for a round?<br/><br/>Our first crawl went pretty well (I think), despite the usual fumbling around trying to figure out a new game. An awesome fairy wizard, an elf wizard, and a hobbit rogue entered the armageddon Megadungeon. A secret way to the lower levels was found in the bottom of a well, but only the fairy could easily get to it. Fighting a band of dragonkin and the Uruk buddy, the fairy realized he could use his "fairy glammer" talent to blind the dragonkin with fairy light, but when he rolled a fumble, he found himself blind instead! Fortunately, the lucky rogue managed to make it out with a sizeable pile of loot, alas, leaving two corpses in the dungeon.<br/><br/>One conclusion we reached is that it's impossible to play this game without immediately house-ruling it and figuring out your own culture of play. The rules are a real rorshach test of role-playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198150/#Comment_198150" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-21T10:41:00+00:00" title="March 21, 2009 10:41AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way I handle humans is that I only allow the triples-explode rule for human characters and not for others. I also reduce the bonuses the other races get considerably - T&amp;T is a pretty unrestrained phantasy game in places, I tweak it more towards pulp fantasy by showing restraint in these things. Players seem to favour human characters due to the added excitement of the triples rule if you just make the benefits other races get a little less extreme; this is just fine with me, I find that I like a human majority in the group best.<br/><br/>Spells take effect before the melee phase of the combat round, I'd say. Simpler that way. Special actions are adjudicated on a case-by-case basis by the GM. Simple actions that have relatively little mechanical impact won't steal your combat action, more powerful actions might reduce your combat effectiveness, and major actions take you out of the combat round altogether. The GM just chooses the right option based on a combination of fictional sensibility and mechanical balance.<br/><br/>Nice to see that you already got into playing. Be sure to introduce the players to the concept of a character stable when they get a bit of experience under their belts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

Is there any tactical reason to ever choose to play a human? I'm scratching my head on this one, thinking there must be something I'm missing.</blockquote>\nRace balance: I suggest there is none.<br/><br/>Tactical reason to play race X: I suggest there is none.\n<blockquote>Also, how do you handle the order of operations? If a wizard casts "Hold that pose", does it rob the target of their action this round, or next round?</blockquote>\nNot sure about this particular spell, but my call is that it's a spell-specific thing. Which one would make the spell "balanced" power-wise, in your opinion, particularly when comparing it to other spells of the same level?<br/>5th edition included some detailed treatise on the exact timing of Take That You Fiend, linking it to both tactical choice on the player's part and GM assessment of the player's promptness in reacting, thus suggesting the answer to this particular question to be both spell-specific and subjective.\n<blockquote> Do you allow players to make an SR to do something crazy in combat, and also fight for the round, or does the SR take the place of the action? For example, if I throw sand in a monster's eyes with an SR roll, do I also get to fight this round? Or is the party on their own without my attack for a round?</blockquote>\nI'd lean toward the former as a general rule, but as a GM I'd judge stunt by stunt.\n<blockquote>One conclusion we reached is that it's impossible to play this game without immediately house-ruling it and figuring out your own culture of play. The rules are a real rorshach test of role-playing.</blockquote>\nI have a feeling that 7.5 is actually more opaque than former editions in this regards, as the older one I've read actually tends to state what you have to make judgements calls about, and to explicitly mark which rules are just suggestions rather than "hard" rules.<br/><br/>BTW, are you playing with just a single PC per player? 2-4 PCs per player was the implied norm with older T&amp;T. I don't remember whether 7.5 discusses the issue at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198170/#Comment_198170" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-21T13:14:40+00:00" title="March 21, 2009  1:14PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Do you allow players to make an SR to do something crazy in combat, and also fight for the round, or does the SR take the place of the action?"<br/><br/>This depends on the what the player's intent is.

That's very cool. There's an interesting mix of possibilities with fighting while doing something else, finghting *instead* of doing something else, setting up for a maneuver later, using terrain, and so on.<br/><br/>We're going to try giving humans a free X2 in the stat of your choice. We've also decided that several of the races must be "unlocked" before they can be played. e.g. kill the Ogre on Dungeon level 1, and you can play an Ogre. Find and return the body Romthar (or whatever that fairy was named), and you can play a fairy. We'll be starting with just Human, Dwarf, Elf, Hobb.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198227/#Comment_198227" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-22T09:28:15+00:00" title="March 22, 2009  9:28AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony,<br/><br/>   I like your ideas for unlocking races and the free double for being human.
