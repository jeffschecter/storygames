I've been rethinking what the basic moves should be based on how (my) In Nomine games seem to go, and I decided that we need clearer and more explicit rules making a distinction between tricking people and using leverage to make people do what you want.  My experience with Apocalypse World and its various hacks is limited, though, so I was hoping some folks here might help me determine whether I'm "breaking" the rules or putting stuff together with obvious loopholes. Here's what I've got, anyway...\n<blockquote><b>Convince Someone</b> (new move)<br/>When you you tell someone something they're inclined to be skeptical of, roll+smooth. On a 10+, they believe you. On a 7-9, they believe you, but the GM also picks 1 as appropriate.<br/>\u2022\xa0They'll want some additional proof of your claim before they let you do anything that could get them in trouble.<br/>\u2022\xa0They'll decide within a few minutes that they were right to be skeptical of you. <br/><br/>Convince a PC: On a hit, they still have the option to read a situation. If you rolled 10+, they get -2 to their roll. If you rolled 7-9, they can roll without penalty. <br/><br/><b>Coerce or Manipulate</b> (blend of Go Aggro/Seduce &amp; Manipulate)<br/>When you use leverage to get someone to do what you want, the type of leverage determines your roll. If you're threatening with something they don't want, roll+hard. If you're offering something they do want, roll+smooth. On a hit, if they refuse to what you want, you can choose 1 of the options below. On a 7-9, they also have the option to make a counteroffer or demand additional positive incentive; if you refuse that, they have the option to accept or refuse your original offer, as above.<br/>\u2022\xa0Gain +1 ongoing against them until you lose your leverage.<br/>\u2022\xa0Deal them harm immediately (if following a threat of violence).<br/><br/>Coerce and Manipulate PCs: On a 10+, choose 2 options below. On a 7-9, choose 1.<br/>\u2022 If they do it, mark an experience. <br/>\u2022 If they refuse, deal harm immediately (if following a threat of violence).<br/>\u2022\xa0If they refuse, they're acting under fire.<br/></blockquote>\nAdvice is appreciated.

The game makes it impossible to force a PC to change their behaviour; you can only incentivise them to do so. Giving them a read person roll isn't good enough, because if they fail the roll then you've forced them to change their behaviour.<br/><br/>Instead, I would go with the seduce/manipulate rules for PCs. They believe you and get XP or it's acting under fire (delete as appropriate). I would go further and say if you lie to a PC, regardless of if it was a strong ht, they gain +1 Hx with you if they ever find out. (Meaning it will be harder to lie to them in future, as they'll presumably opt to interfere.)<br/><br/>Coerce/manipulate:<br/>The weak hit rule seems a bit, uh, weak. If the NPC can bargain but you can ignore it and get the benefit of a strong hit by doing so, why wouldn't you go for the strong hit?<br/><br/>Out of curiosity, why brigade the two together at all?

Good suggestion about +1 Hx, too.<br/><br/>If someone can convince me I ought to be using the original rules as written, it'd certainly make my life easier. Right now, the reason I'm trying to reorganize things is that I have a really hard time following how the fiction of the game fits with the names/concepts behind moves, and I know my players will have a hard time too. I'm also trying to avoid some of the most common confusion I see around Go Aggro/Seize by Force/Seduce &amp; Manipulate I've seen around forums as I search around in an attempt to figure out how this stuff works. My problems in a nutshell:<br/><br/>1. It confuses me whenever "threat" is used to describe Go Aggro, as I feel like that word implicitly includes the possibility of an <i>empty</i> threat. There is no such thing as an empty threat with this move. I coupled it with Manipulation partly because I wanted to give PCs the option to back out of delivering harm (as you could with a real threat), and partly because the 7-9 results on Go Aggro don't actually look like win conditions to me. Perhaps it does deserve to be its own move, but I'm not sure I understand it yet. From where I sit, Go Aggro feels like it should actually be called "Seize by Force": You want something from somebody, and they either give it to you or you (attempt to) injure them so you can get it. But then, we already have a move for Seize by Force...<br/><br/>2. It strikes me as weird that NPCs can't turn down a deal at all on a 10+. Keep in mind that I'm working with a setting in which your enemies are often functionally immortal, and whatever you do to them is probably nothing compared to what they're bosses will do to them if they turn traitor. I don't see a demonic NPC being manipulated into giving you the info you want just because you rolled a 10+ on your empty threat or breakable promise with Seduce &amp; Manipulate, so I thought the move might make more sense if they had the option to refuse at some penalty (the one thing I do like about a 10+ roll on Go Aggro). <br/><br/>3. I also don't really get how "promises" are supposed to work with Seduce &amp; Manipulate, but that makes it sound like this move is better suited to making deals than simply convincing somebody of your identity or motives. I thought it might be worth it to have a basic move associated with the Smooth stat that is basically just smooth-talking: convincing someone of your sincerity, whether honestly or not. The "promise" mechanic feels a little tacked on when you think about it in a scenario like "I'm pretending to be a cop to sneak onto a crime scene." Yeah, I'm sure you can figure out a way to work a promise into it if you stage a little mental rodeo around it, but why struggle to make the fiction fit the rules?<br/><br/>All of that said, maybe I can just go with the RAW (either Apocalypse World's or Monsterhearts) for the most part if I rename and rephrase some stuff. I'm happy to be schooled on why I don't get stuff and how I might rethink it so it's easier for me to sell to my players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386654/#Comment_386654" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-08T10:52:19+00:00" title="August  8, 2012 10:52AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the way it was explained to me, an empty threat would be a manipulate roll. If you succeed then they accept "I wont beat you up" as exchange for whatever. If you get a weak hit then you have to demonstrate that you are willing to beat them up (or perhaps somehow demonstrate that you won't beat them up after they've done what you want?).<br/><br/>Go aggro is for when you're pretty much beating someone up and they have to do what you want to get you to stop.<br/><br/>But anyway, I wouldn't use this system for a game in which your adversaries are serious important characters in their own right. Remember, AW explicitly tells you to look through crosshairs at your NPCs. That's probably why they are reasonably manipulable, because they just aren't the stars of the story. That's the same reason the PCs aren't manipulable in this way. That said, FWIW I wouldn't let an NPC be manipulated with just any promise, it has to be something they want that you could plausibly give them. You can't just say "I'll give you this orange in exchange for a lifetime's service", or "I'll give you all the gold in fort knox in exchange for..."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386656/#Comment_386656" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-08T10:59:00+00:00" title="August  8, 2012 10:59AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why would you use the Apocalypse World rules for a totally different game? <br/><br/>AW is not a game where people have something bigger back home they care about, it's a game where people are led around by their body parts and don't know where the next meal is coming from.

The core mechanic is excellent. You do have to rewrite the moves (and possibly the Principles), however, to make it fit with other genres and settings. (And I appreciated the advice from Vincent <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=3617.0" rel="nofollow">specifically recommending</a> that Go Aggro, Seize By Force, and Seduce/Manipulate should all be redesigned for all hacks.)<br/><br/>Along those lines, Apocalypse World has different Principles from some of its hacks. I appreciate how "look through the crosshairs" works in that game, and also how it's adapted effectively for Monsterhearts' "treat your NPCs like stolen cars." I haven't decided what that Principle will be like for this hack, but I'm generally comfortable with the idea that NPCs are expendable, ephemeral playthings. What I do have a problem with, though, is when my players get lazy, and that sometimes necessitates NPCs who won't crumble with a single, poorly-thought-out Manipulation move. And, hell, I feel like that even goes for Apocalypse World.

I appreciate how "look through the crosshairs" works in that game, and also how it's adapted effectively for Monsterhearts' "treat your NPCs like stolen cars." I haven't decided what that Principle will be like for this hack, but I'm generally comfortable with the idea that NPCs are expendable, ephemeral playthings. What I do have a problem with, though, is when my players get lazy, and that sometimes necessitates NPCs who won't crumble with a single, poorly-thought-out Manipulation move. And, hell, I feel like that even goes for Apocalypse World. Every once in a while you're going to come up against someone who's a little too smart to fall for the bullshit line you use to get an extra spoonful of soup from the homely cook at lunchtime, you know? </blockquote>\nHeh, I love the stolen cars principle. Must. Play. Monsterhearts.<br/><br/>I'm totally with you on the "someone who is a little too smart" thing. One of the things that I instinctively find a little unsatisfactory about AW is that the competence of NPCs has (almost) nothing to do with a PC's success chances. It doesn't diminish my enjoyment of the game but there's a little obsessive in me who is annoyed by it. Anyway, it seems to me if you want a game where NPCs have power too, you could go with something like Antisinecurist's suggestion above, or create some kind of opposed roll system i.e. subtract your opponent's Hard (or in the case of manipulate/bluff probably Sharp) from your roll. You might need to think again about the default 7+ success number, depending on whether NPCs with a +1 stat or better will be frequent, and depending whether you're bothered that this could leave your PCs feeling less awesome competent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386718/#Comment_386718" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-09T06:14:50+00:00" title="August  9, 2012  6:14AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Demons are always a step from hell, angels from heaven, and mortals but a step from both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386726/#Comment_386726" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-09T09:00:11+00:00" title="August  9, 2012  9:00AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am leaning toward using something like this move instead of the Convince Someone move written above, adapted from Storming the Wizard's Tower: <br/><br/><b>Convince Someone</b><br/>When you want someone to believe what you tell them, roll+smooth.

I'm especially interested in getting this lying/convincing rule right because the rules for these things are SO unhelpful in In Nomine that I just want something that spells out "these are the options available to you when you do this," and Apocalypse World is great for that. <br/><br/>My original approach to the game actually looked a lot like what you suggest here, but I ended up running into so many things that seemed overly complex and hard to translate that I decided it'd actually be easier to just start from the ground up and cut out anything that felt unnecessary to the original game. Six characteristics AND three realms of Forces to add to skill/song levels? Gone. Three realms for every single song, with at least a third of the songs being practically useless? Gone. A weirdly half-extensive skill list full of stuff my players have no idea how to make useful? Mostly gone. (Some of the skills we actually use will live on as moves. If you want to play the mandolin, though, I'm not going to charge you for it. I mean, what the hell.)<br/><br/>Plus, my other reason for doing this is that I'm finding it a useful, low-pressure design exercise. Big project, but it's not like I lose money if I screw it up and everybody hates it. <br/><br/>Hope that doesn't sound dismissive.

Fighting and weapon skills get bundled under one or more basic attack moves (and decoupling skills from stats that determine your durability eliminates the disproportionately pro-swordfighting mechanics of the original). Lying and Fast Talk are probably just getting bundled into that Convince Someone move above, though I may have an additional Strike a Deal move that more resembles the manipulation skills from other AW hacks. Tracking is pretty well covered by my modified approach to Read a Sitch, which is more like "investigate a scene." Plenty of the rest can just be grouped under Act Under Fire, if I feel like it, a general movement-related move for stuff like Move Silently, Climbing, Running, Swimming, Dodge, etc. The one skill my players actually take that might not make the cut is Lock Picking, as everyone who takes it ends up annoyed that they never get to use it as long as there's a Windie in the group.<br/><br/>My plan right now is to start characters with their resonance move, their choir attunement move, and one other move from their Choir Playbook or Superior Playbook, which may be a song, attunement, skill, or Role. Roles are kind of weird in original In Nomine, as it's heavily implied that you really ought to have one (in case you need some cash or get pulled over for speeding..?), but they bog you down with a day job cost a disproportionate number of character points. My working plan is just to say that Roles require GM permission and allow you to collaborate with the GM to make a custom move. (Like, for the ever popular private investigator: "When you consult your sources....") You'd also be able to roll+decades spent in the Role in order to see if your Role masks disturbance you've caused through performing your Role (7-9, some of it, 10+ all of it), but I have literally never had a PC actually do this. My players take roles like "Financial Investigator" and "Ecological Consultant" instead of whatever combat-oriented stuff SJG might have had in mind (Cop! Pro wrestler! Bazooka tester!), so I just rule that they can shred paper and turn over soil without causing a disturbance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386885/#Comment_386885" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-11T16:33:44+00:00" title="August 11, 2012  4:33PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Making Roles into a +workspace-like move sounds fine to me.
