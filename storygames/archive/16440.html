I was literally walking the five kilometers up treacherous rainy backwoods trail between Zuisenji and Kenchoji temples in Kamakura when some moderation stuff came up. Pretty interesting series of events, I'll post more on it (including pics and videos!) later. Anyway, thanks for the Internet Age! I was able to trade some emails with the moderation team from a rocky outcropping on a mountain!<br/><br/><b><i>...moderation team? </i></b><br/><br/>Yeah, I've alluded to "moderation team" in a few posts and over on the Story Games Google Plus page. I hadn't announced it with the appropriate fanfare that I wanted (with little bios and stuff) because I've been backed up from work, life, etc. I will be doing such a thing soon.<br/><br/>But for now, because I've been gone for several days and will be for a few more (I leave tomorrow to come back to the US after being gone for a month), I need to at least post something so that folks aren't totally confused if moderation actions happen (Sinks, Closes, HTML code fixes in whispers [all moderators have the ability to read whispers, mostly in order to fix broken HTML and stuff, as stated in the original rules thread], post edits, etc).<br/><br/>Story Games is luckily not really approaching the "too much for one guy" limit yet, but about six months ago I realized that I needed some checks, some sounding board, some people to help moderate (giving them the same authoritative power that I do - that level of trust) in the places that I can't see. People whose opinion I trust and respect, ESPECIALLY where it diverges from my own. So here are the people I asked to help, and these are your moderators:<br/><br/><b>Andy</b> (Andy Kitkowski, that's me)<br/><br/><b>Jason Morningstar</b> (Jason Morningstar) - Designer, Critic, Fast Draw, Tolerates far less than me, and S-G is so much better for it<br/><br/><b>jenskot</b> (John Stavropoulos) - A social media genius who shares my notion/ideal of empathy, understanding, and also shares a nose for social maneuvering/bullshit<br/><br/><b>anansigirl</b> (Kira Scott) - A true warrior-poet, she has fought for the community with empathy and brilliance, and has brought several interesting perspectives in private discussions<br/><br/><b>Zac in Virginia</b> (Zac Dettwyler) - Born in the social critique pits and hardened by rational discourse, he presents things in new ways, from multiple angles<br/><br/>So there we are. A critical and empathic team of different backgrounds and races (no, I wasn't gunning for a Captain Planet cadre, it just kinda worked out that way)... well, save that we're all currently American (but John shares my hair-trigger for issues of American/Western monoculturalism, I'm hoping that counts), that couldn't be avoided. Four other people who also wield the same power I do. We usually talk about stuff before we act on it, but sometimes need forces our hand.<br/><br/>But in the end, nothing dramatic: They've actually been in this role - with all the power and all that - for a few months now, I've just been too busy (read Lazy) to get around to a grand introduction. So this is the mini version.<br/><br/>Moderation will happen as it normally does: 98% of the time through directed whispers and the like rather than "public callings out". Major actions (warnings, bannings etc) unless especially egregious are also of course carried out as always, from the shadows and not in public (I don't believe in these forum "public executions", they attract bizarre human behavior). <br/><br/>Anyway, that's the state of things. Just so there's no confusion when someone who Isn't Me moderates. I'll be adding this information eventually to the "Rules" sticky thread eventually.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375845/#Comment_375845" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-02T07:32:11+00:00" title="May  2, 2012  7:32AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Oh, who do you contact when you have a problem or question?</b><br/><br/>Default, if you just want to reach out to anybody: Whisper me.
