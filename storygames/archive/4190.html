Instead, I'm pleasantly surprised that it takes what are, for me, half-explored paths-- and melds them into a complete game.   I am eager to play, but I wonder if any of the stumbling blocks I encountered pursuing similar ideas-- will present themselves in Psi Run.  Or whether it will neatly slip past such problems.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
