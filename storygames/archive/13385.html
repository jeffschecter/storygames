Everything was too happy.<br/><br/>* The tilt. Totally confused by the text. How many tilts. How are they applied. Etc.<br/><br/>(I guess you'll need to read the original AP to answer; if you can't be bothered but still would like to help, I can go more into the problems I had)<br/><br/>(Just to say this here again, we loved the game. Especially the relationship network came up with so much juicy potential. If anything I was unhappy because I felt there was an even better story in there that didn't quite come out.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301707/#Comment_301707" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-22T04:44:19+00:00" title="November 22, 2010  4:44AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Also answered at the Forge)<br/><br/>Hi Daniel,<br/><br/>I'm glad you guys had fun with Fiasco. Thanks for writing your session up, and I hope you'll give it another try!<br/><br/>Your question about the Tilt is answered on page 41, and is demonstrated in the replay on page 117. The players whose dice have the highest black and white totals respectively choose Tilt elements, so you have a total of two. These are fair game for anybody to incorporate and serve as signposts for what to expect in Act Two. They don't need to pop up at any particular time, and occasionally one or the other doesn't show up at all.<br/><br/>You're on the right track about the Setup - by limiting choice players end up with situations they may not have selected if all 144 elements were available to them, which leads to surprise and creative uncertainty, which is fun. It also greatly speeds the Setup. Everything in the playset is fair game for incorporation - the things attached to Relationships just happen to be really important to those people. Mine it for cool stuff, for sure.<br/><br/>Choosing "To Get Out" as a Need can be tricky. There's no reason to artificially make your character stay, since you have an entire arsenal of creative tools (flashbacks, smash cuts, etc) to continue the narrative in their absence. But if everybody is listening and on top of things, they should be working hard to make that Need problematic. If what you need is to get out, everybody at the table should be working hard to make you stay. So more than most, it relied on the creative contributions of others to really kick hard.<br/><br/>It's good practice to work toward establishing strong relationships with every character built during the Setup. Often when I am not sure what sort of scene I should frame, I'll look to see which characters haven't interacted much and build a scene around that potential interaction. This works whether I'm framing a scene for myself or another player.<br/><br/>As far as making things go wrong, that's totally a tonal issue that you and your friends need to work out. The game is structured freeform, and the only inputs for genre emulation occur during the Tilt and Setup (there's also some fairly esoteric stuff going on with the dice and genre emulation). Outcomes are deliberately vague, and you guys can decide what "positive" and "negative" mean in the context of your play. It sounds like you were settling for mellow outcomes, which is fine if that's what you want, but there's nothing wrong with making a negative outcome truly horrendous if you are resolving it. If you felt like you guys weren't playing hard enough, play harder next time! You definitely had a killer situation in that game.<br/><br/>--Jason                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielZKlein" title="DanielZKlein"><img alt="DanielZKlein" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielZKlein">DanielZKlein</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301715/#Comment_301715" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-22T05:41:31+00:00" title="November 22, 2010  5:41AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since I already replied on the Forge, I guess we'll keep the discussion there.
