Floor Games is what it is - thank you HG Wells. But that is a name that just lays there. So here is my suggestion.<br/><br/>Little Worlds.<br/><br/>Maybe Little Worlds Exploration<br/><br/>This tips its hat to HG Wells' second game book "Little Wars". It also suggests little/miniature/small but whole worlds so it is a terrain field as well.<br/><br/>There is a Little Worlds on line comic, it was the title of a Bela Fleck banjo album (I love his work!), a video game studio in France, and a few other things. There is also a board game called "Small Worlds" (Fun game, you should try it out). So I don't think it conflicts too much with other uses of the phrase.<br/><br/>What do you think?<br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353873/#Comment_353873" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T07:07:45+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  7:07AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2012 7:19AM by komradebob.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's a very good working name Chris.<br/><br/>Everything I've been coming up with as I've been noodling at writing up the concept and philosphy has been deeply unfun sounding.<br/><br/><i>Minaitures Leisure Story Play</i> or some variation is as close as I've gotten, and I'm not really happy with that.<br/><br/>In a way,I think there are multiple common ways that immediately present themselves.<br/><br/>Your Christmas Eve Medieval Paris game is one of them, and probably the closest to a story play event. The Host starts out with a core, easily explanable idea, the collection of appropriate stuff, a few extra ideas and some rndom stuff (goats and Doctor Who) that <i>could</i> be used creatively, and then kinda just presents them to their guests and lets them run with it and see where it goes. The host just mostly acts as a facilitator once things get under way, showing off whatever simple mechanical tools are available and how they can be used ( with the goal of getting players to use them or call for their use themselves).<br/><br/>I think there's also some form of world building game, or at least preliminary game too. Maybe this is an advanced form, where players try to suss out a pattern from the collecton presented, and only then build the world and story? I'm currently calling that style a <i>Crash Game</i>. It's meant to be a bit harder and spark everyone's creativity and frankly take things in weird directions story and world wise. The concept here is that the host either picks out strange bits for the collection ( things one wouldn't normally imagine going together) or invites players to show up with parts of their personal collections, and only then builds the events and set up with the help of the guests from scratch.<br/><br/>There is also a concept that i thought of recently while writing up example situations of types of events I might run, called <i>There and back again, Again</i>. It's kind of a hybrid idea, based on <i>The Hobbit </i>(hence the name) and other fantasy fiction where a relatively normal outsider character gets drawn away from tthe world they know into the wider fantasy world. I suppose it could just as easily be done with John Carter or Taran of Caer Dalben or any made up similar sort of character. This one really is about exploration and building the world as you go. In this case, the table layout is mostly blank, save for a small corner of it representing home and just the border of the unknown. The rest of the collection, people and lanscape stuff and monsters and what-not are all to the side. The game is played out s the main charater and any companions move along the table. Players take turns placing terrain and other characters as play progresses in a sort of winding path towards the other table corner. along the way, new places and people and threats are introduced by the players themselves ( taking turns at it presumably). By the end of play, the main characters have had a strange and epic journey, and the beginnings of a small world have been created, all on the seemingly confined space of a table top.<br/><br/>Finally, I think there can be space for another sort of play, one I'll call Town and Country Drama or perhaps Expanded Dollhouse play. This isn't really meant to be high action, but rather centers around normal (if perhaps exotic) people and their interpersonal strife and gossipy goings on. True, not what you'd normally expect from minis play, but seems like a natural one especially for non-gamers. My daughter, for example, loved this sort of play with little toy people, and I see no reason it couldn't be explored fruitfully.<br/><br/>For myself, I'm working on a short written piece meant to introduce this approach to minis play based on the conceit that the players are all crew and actors working for a cheapo movie studio that has a very short amount of time to produce a quickie action film. It's really meant to act as training wheels for folks who some background in other sorts of miniatures play, rpgs, or storygames, but who may find some of the peculiarities of simple play as play a bit harder to digest initially ( I don't think very casual, not terribly competitive game players or total novices really need these training wheels to be perfectly honest).<br/><br/>If you ( or anyone else reading along) can come up with a snazzy name for that concept or a working title, i'd be deeply appreciative!<br/><br/>edit:<br/><br/>Durn I can be dumb sometimes.<i> Little Hollywod </i>or <i>Little Movie Studio</i> or something similar with Little in the title reallywould be appropriate wouldn't it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353938/#Comment_353938" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T11:53:47+00:00" title="January 11, 2012 11:53AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like your games! Both would work as explorations. One as an obvious exploration and the other as an exploration of making a movie. I like Little Hollywood over movie Studio. Makes me think of the Wierd Al VHS movie.<br/><br/>I can forsee much resistance to this style of play because it literally is kid's stuff. Which is personally what I want.

I don't think the version of this kind of play that I'm exploring has rules, because, well, it's <i>play</i>, with just a little borrowing of organization,methods, and mechanics from <i>games</i>. heck, i don't even plan to have a section for rules, just a section on tools for resolving reative differences quickly. Yeah, i know, that a bit of a semantic shell-game, but I do think that difference matters to promoting the right vibe for play.<br/><br/>I get that this stuff is a very niche interest, but I do think it's an easy niche interest to share, if that makes sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
