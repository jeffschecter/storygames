In an RPG, what's the difference between playing a "hero" and playing a "character" (i.e. what makes a hero different from a character)?  And a follow-up question:  which games let you play a hero and which games only let you play characters?<br/><br/>I'm not sure this question is phrased very well, but I'll see what I get.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy<br/><br/>Note: do not equate "hero" with "superhero"  That's not what I'm talking about?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity" title="Sempiternity"><img alt="Sempiternity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/bcp5010/stefan2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity">Sempiternity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58950/#Comment_58950" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-04T17:03:58+00:00" title="March  4, 2007  5:03PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there really a difference between the archetypical hero and super-hero in gaming?<br/><br/>To me the only way to have a "plain hero" in a game, is for their aspect of heroism to emerge from the fiction - in other words, to have a normal, complex, shades-of-gray "character" whose fiction suddenly develops to show them in a heroic light, comaparatively.<br/><br/>But i don't think i've ever had that happen, so i cannot really say...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58965/#Comment_58965" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T01:23:10+00:00" title="March  5, 2007  1:23AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hero implies that the character is noble, honourable or "good."

Stefan hits one of the important ones, a protagonist who decides to do the right thing when pressures could cause him not to do so. Frodo is a hero this way because he decides to take the ring to Mordor when nobody expects him to, and he could much more easily go home with a purple heart for action at Weathertop.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you see a lot of this in RPG play. I do, at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Hero Quest, the term "hero" is synonomous with Player Character. What's interesting is that you as often get anti-heroes or villains as heroes in my experience playing that game. There's another meaning that's explicit in that game, however, which is "very powerful individual." I suppose it makes sense to take the question of superheroes to another thread, but it's been endemic in RPGs to have hero mean a powerful character ever since D&amp;D; had levels named hero and superhero. Basically since levels allowed a character to perform "heroic deeds" because they have lots of hit points.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is heroism ala Beowulf. And I think that there might be a tendency to see it as infantile power fantasies, or powergaming, or some sort of escapism. But I think it's a valid form of expression to have mythic stories that heighten the sense of importance of moral questions by having the world hanging on a thread depending on the character's actions and fate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's fascinating is how most fantasy games assume that we'll want to take the "Hero's Journey" (to use a Campbellism), starting from the character being a modest farmer or something, to being the warrior who saves the world. That's actually understandable. The idea that we'd want that development to take years of actual play, however, is odd. Trying to force us to have to experience every step of the training process in the character's development, instead of just skipping young Luke Skywalker's Padwan training for the most part, and just getting to the last episode where he's a Jedi (a function of gamism, actually).<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58984/#Comment_58984" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T06:31:41+00:00" title="March  5, 2007  6:31AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I associate being a hero with sacrifice.  A hero, as opposed to an adventurer or whatever other title you care to use, evokes images in my mind of someone giving of themselves, even their own life, in order to help or save something else.  It doesn't even have to be a noble idea, a simple 1st level Fighter in classic D&amp;D dying to protect his village is just fine.  He gave the ultimate sacrifice, his own life, in order to protect those he cared about.<br><br>This is why I think With Great Power... is such an incredible game, since all the mechanics revolve around sacrifice.  It really plays up the "you are a hero" aspect of the game.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
