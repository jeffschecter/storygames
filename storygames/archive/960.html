                            I don't want to get into the whole "brain-damaged" argument or anything, but when I read the guy saying that playing this way is something to try with a new generation, doesn't it seem like somehow a generation got lost? I mean are kids somehow more imaginative now than we were? Or did we learn somewhere along the way to supress our imaginations "for the good of the game?" <br/>

I always find it fun when somebody discovers these things independently. <br/>

Yep. I think it was called 'school' to start with. Then the 'rulebook'.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I agree, Meg. The systematic structuring of systems in order to disempower the participats is a surefire way to make sure they don't come up with any good ideas.                        </div>

                            I think what struck me was the sincerity of the vignette--of how the dad realizes the validity of his son's play style because he is engaged more attentively with his son, attending to him not just as a player, but as a person to be cared for.  That caring for the person of the player might be something to consider in the game (yeah, that's vague and touchy-feely, but I'll indulge myself).  Juxtapose that with how long that style has actually been explored by others and...well, funny-ironic tingling follows.                        </div>

<i>Then the 'rulebook'.</i><br/><br/>I think the shutting down of input has to be one of the worst artifacts of our hobby, especially since you can't imagine together as a group without communication.  <br/><br/>Though, it's a multilayered issue- you have some rules which "Chicken Little", or cripple player input, often backed by hearty GM Fiat on top of that, you have rules for specific types of play claiming to do everything, and you have bad social contract buried under geek fallacy and poor play advice.<br/><br/>Combined together, we get the walls of gamer baggage.                        </div>

                            I think the acceptance of player narrative input is a really good thing for the hobby, it really broadens out what people can do in games and can be a lot of fun.<br/><br/>That said, it's good because it's a broadening out of the play possibilities available to us, not because it's intrinsically better.  Intrinsically better for some people sure, but not per se.<br/><br/>When I play I prefer not to have narrative input, because part of the joy of gaming for me is the act of discovery and the impression that the game world is a real place that I'm exploring.  Narrative control kills that for me, as I can't imagine it's a real place when I made a bit of it up a minute ago.<br/><br/>Now, I suppose one could argue that I had been damaged in some way, but leaving aside the fact that that argument kills off any dialogue as I can't meaningfully respond to an analysis which categorises me as incapable of working out for myself what I enjoy and why (plus it's incredibly patronising), I also think it's wrong.<br/><br/>Tastes vary, having a broader range of gaming catering to more tastes is great, but a lack of narrative input may not be because people are straightjacketed from that but because people don't always want it.  The sad thing historically, is there always were those I think who would have wanted it, but until quite recently nobody catered to those guys.                        </div>

                            Rossum, more common than you might think.  The "GM's PC" or "GMPC" has many possible functions, but one of them is simply to allow the GM the opportunity to participate in 1-1 roleplay with a continuing character, because in these sorts of games, anyone who doesn't have "PC" tattooed on their forehead gets killed or made irrelevant in fairly short order.                        </div>

It's a pretty common device.  In theory(ish)-speak, it moves an important informational coduit and consensus forum between the players to the SIS.  Instead of sitting around and deciding, player-to-player, what to do next with the narrative, you do it through the proxy of your characters in the SIS.  It's less efficient and can be heavy-handed (or underhanded) when the GM starts confusing character motivation and the role of this consensus-building tool.<br/><br/>It's just a different forum for player negotiation.                        </div>
