I've played D&amp;D, Pathfinder, Earthdawn and Necromunda, which isn't what I'm talking about. What I mean is, I played one game of Fiasco, and thought it was great, after which I took to the Internet to find out what else was out there. I found lots of interesting games, games where the rules focus more on story than on player stats; but the only other one I've played so far was MonkeyDome.<br/><br/>What I like about MonkeyDome is that it's a good game based on a bad idea. Namely, the idea of switching tone constantly. One of the things that can go wrong in a game of Fiasco is players not having a working consensus on the story's tone or genre. Yet the basic premise in MonkeyDome is that the game boomerangs back and forth; violence has grim repercussions one minute, but physics can be cartoonish the next.<br/><br/>So, I like the idea of trying to come up with bad premises and then make them work. This can hardly be argued to be a good technique, but it can help to think outside the box.<br/><br/>Specifically, I've been trying to think of bad premises for story games.<br/><br/>The first one I came up with was tic-tac-toe based. Players would place X's and O's in the grid, but X's had to go with narrations that help the PC's, O's, things  that hinder them. The position played adds further constraints - the left column, 'well' (do a good job helping or hindering), the right column meaning 'poorly', and the middle column 'chaotic outcome'.<br/><br/>I had constraints for the rows too but they weren't very good - mental, physical, moral.<br/><br/>Winning games of tic tac toe allows the game to move forward. A line of three O's means some current obstacle can be overcome; three X's, though, means some twist or further obstacle. The three lined up pieces are removed from the board, rather than starting the tic tac toe over, so that most likely things will alternate between X-victory and O-victory.<br/><br/>CAT (tie) games should be undesirable; they either end the game, or you can reset the tic tac toe board at the cost of killing off a character or marring the world with retcon or with something genre-inappropriate.<br/><br/>Enough about that silly game though. Here's a better idea: a game that simulates group decision-making, specifically requiring you to get the group excited about whatever facts you're introducing to the story. The simplest version would be a sort of reverse Universalis, where people have a supply of coins they can pay to ratify other peoples' ideas and make them fact.<br/><br/>The "bad idea" that I like, though, would be to have separate "ideas" and "facts". If you suggest something as a mere possibility, then it can't become fact by itself. This represents how presenting something as merely possible, or one of several possibilities, doesn't do a good job of getting people excited about it. Once something has been presented in that way, the game should only allow it to be fact-ified by addition of a "fact" - for example you might say "Well, we could play a game of political intrigue in an isolated castle..." but you don't want to commit to it so it's just an Idea. Someone else says "Yes, let's have a castle on an island!" and - supposing whatever game mechanics there are allow them to make this fact - the isolated castle becomes factified.<br/><br/>In order to really drive home the dichotomy, Ideas are banned from coining proper nouns, or even descriptive details like color. Facts are required to have names or descriptive details.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440802/#Comment_440802" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-10T18:54:20+00:00" title="December 10, 2014  6:54PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome to Story Games!<br/><br/>The sort of tinkering you are doing is great, and often leads to cool insights or new discoveries.

The idea (sometimes more in theory than practice) is that a "pool of ideas" begins to build up, such that, even if you have no good ideas yourself, you can look at the pool and find something, adding to it until it becomes "established" as "real" (in the story).<br/><br/>It steam-engines when it's steam-engine time, right?  Multiple inventors come up with similar ideas, implying that those ideas are ready to come forth into the world, just waiting for inventor's heads to use as their conduits.<br/><br/>Maybe we're experiencing the concretization of a core conceptual mechanic in the genealogy of certain types of collaborative writing games: the "<b>idea pool</b>".<br/><br/>Keep going.

Sw/oM looks really cool and well put together. I basically played Monkeydome in preparation for playing it. I ought to have said, the Bad Idea that made Monkeydome tick revealed the possibility that became Sw/oM. So taking that as more the paradigm, it makes sense to first try to design a working game based somewhat strictly around the bad idea, then to borrow ideas or simply soften the bad idea itself and build on the result.<br/><br/>It's fairly hard to come up with bad ideas as good as the tone rolls... but I've got a couple more.<br/><br/>First, reward people for being vague and undescriptive. This idea seems practically so bad as to be unworkable, but that just means I'm getting somewhere! A working game that does this would clearly be very different.<br/><br/>Here's two ideas. First, a game about the longer plot arcs in a TV series. So on your turn you might say "This episode is about Detective Sam getting in the middle of a big gunfight. His co-workers warn him not to get involved so we get to see some sexual tension between him and Madeline." Each turn is an episode, and the relationships and events which span the episodes would be all that matters. So the game would cram in all these largely irrelevant events. Depending on how much structure the game needs, there could be cards with plot possibilities (long-term stuff like on-again off-again romance, or bigger villains behind the little villains) or even a board with several literal plot arcs. Heh! To go with the TV show theme, maybe player incentives are influenced by ratings which are affected by a dice roll. So you do a romance episode and it boosts ratings, now you have incentive to do more romance.<br/><br/>Well that got to boardgamey. I was thinking players could somehow be rewarded for skimming over more episodes, but that probably worldn't work.<br/><br/>Another way to approach the bad idea would be to have description be vague, but demand quite a bit of it. So the thing you wouldn't want to have happen would be, your characters are confronted by a huge troll in the forest, and someone says "ok, we defeat it." One way of making this better is to demand detail, sure. But it's also possible to pile on vagueness instead. "We vanquish the beast but in so doing, learn a terrible lesson at great cost." These sorts of sentences will (hopefully, sometimes) get people thinking. It could work to have one person add new complications and events to the story in these types of vague terms, and let the other players fill in details. Not sure how abstract-level control would flow around; maybe people simply take turns. But another way than just letting people fill in ideas would be to have people jot down an idea and then reveal. Maybe two people have to come up with the same idea for it to happen, or maybe the opposite - the idea has to be unique.<br/><br/>Or, scratch the figuring out which one happens. How about this... everyone just says their idea of what happened out loud, and then the next person gets a turn to make a vague statement. But the incentive is to make a statement so vague, any of the previous round's ideas could still be true. The more peoples' ideas of what happened you manage to not contradict, the more points you get. If you end up falsifying someone's idea, then they get a point instead of you. (So you don't care about the idea you contributed; you get the point either way.)<br/><br/>Of course, someone could get a lot of points by killing off players, since then anything involving the dead players would be impossible. But since anyone could take that strategy, it wouldn't be a stable approach.<br/><br/>Well, that actually sounds kinda worth trying. Here's some other 'bad ideas' I came up with... I'm going to force myself not to write as much on them. Otherwise I won't write them all down.<br/><br/>A game which constantly jumps out of the narrative context.  Each turn would begin by claiming the previous person's turn was just the official report, but you know what really happened; or that their turn was the Hollywood version, and yours is the original novel; or that theirs is the myth as retold 100 years after the fact, but here's what actually happened.<br/><br/>Defy plot logic, enforce normal logic. This is just sort of an image of play - one player says something like "up ahead there are some crumbled stones, signs that you're approaching long-forgotten ruins of a magnificent temple." Another player says "wait, how likely are we of all people to run into something that's apparently not been visited since a forgotten age?" The players then must agree on a rough model of how likely this is. How high could the density of forgotten ruins possibly be? Why wouldn't they become known? The goal is to come up with a very rough number and choose a die roll. The unlikely idea can't be ruled out entirely, but it has to be rolled for. The roll isn't just yes/no; it has to have some other possibilities like a still-inhabited temple, a forgotten river or swamp, whatever else comes up in the discussion of the model.<br/><br/>That would be hard to develop into anything playable, but I like the idea of making models of how likely various tropes are. It gives some opportunity to design the world to be interesting.<br/><br/>Reward normalcy. It's always unfortunate when someone says 'well, my character is pretty much a normal barbarian...' Or, I used to play Glossotechnia quite a bit, which is a language-making game. And people would sometimes make a word for, say, "drink" and I would try to coach them a bit by asking questions... "does your word apply to foods like soup? Where is the line drawn between food and drink? How do people refer to drinking alchohol?" Sometimes people get in this mode where they think they've got an interesting intuition for how their newly coined word should be used, but when I try to ask about interesting wrinkles all their answers are really just defaulting to English usage. Obviously the same thing happens in RPG's occasionally. What if a game really encouraged you to play "just a regular X," and have your character "just go along with whatever"? I have no idea how that could work, though it helps that a normal, average druid is still trying to protect nature or something, and a normal, average space marine is probably a long way from home, etc.<br/><br/>How could this be a core mechanic though?<br/><br/>Finish each others' sentences. What if everyone has to start sentences but not finish them? This is just a silly idea but like I said, it's hard to come up with good bad ideas. Anyone got any?\n<blockquote>That Tic Tac Toe thing is really great!</blockquote>\nHa! Glad you thought so. What should the rows be, though? Mental/physical/moral didn't seem to get me very far.\n<blockquote><br/>Maybe we're experiencing the concretization of a core conceptual mechanic in the genealogy of certain types of collaborative writing games: the "<b>idea pool</b>".<br/><br/>Keep going.  Me like!<br/></blockquote>\nYeah... In high school my idea of a creative game of my own design was to make a chess-like game played on triangular tiles. There are just so many more games I've been exposed to now, it's inevitable that I can think of more.<br/><br/>I feel like my ideas/facts game could go a lot of different directions; I don't know what other mechanics to use with it - it's too easy to simply imagine people paying tokens to coin facts and ideas. I want to remain temporarily faithful to the idea that once something is proposed as an Idea, it can't be a Fact without at least some more detail (in the form of a new Fact) tacked onto it. I'd also like to have another vaguely sociology-based rule somewhere.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440866/#Comment_440866" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-12T18:32:00+00:00" title="December 12, 2014  6:32PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome!<br/><br/>For the tictactoe idea (nice, by the way), perhaps the rows could be overtly/accidentally/subtly?<br/><br/>So top left would be overtly good, bottom middle is subtly chaotic, middle right is accidentally bad, etc                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442180/#Comment_442180" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-28T04:49:59+00:00" title="January 28, 2015  4:49AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice post!<br/><br/>Deliberately trying to brainstorm bad ideas is a *wonderful* technique, and very useful in all kinds of creative fields.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
