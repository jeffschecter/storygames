Nobody gets paid when a Polaris game really clicks and our four (presumably ideologically pure non-GM) players knock it out of the park.

Only that it be "good enough" to get you to buy the next thing.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nLet's talk about what kind of financial incentives would lead to an improvement in play experience. (Let's set aside for now the reasons that things like designing a new game are pursued when doing a support product for Pathfinder, or an e-book on how to make money writing RPGs, might earn more money but less respect.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think that simply charging for gaming experiences rather than gaming products is enough. A gaming services company, like the Abantey Workshop in Berkeley or a myriad of similar afterschool programs in Israel, has an incentive to make an employee training manual that invests effort in making its staff better facilitators of play experience. So far as I know - and I hope someone knows why I'm wrong - this hasn't been done; training of new GMs happens along the same lines it does in a non-professional environment, and while I don't doubt that someone like Abantey's Becky Thomas is a great GM as the result of having done it as a full-time job for decades, I don't know of any way to benefit from her experience short of going to work for her one summer - which is not different from the way as an amateur I seek out GMs whose gamesI want to play in so I can learn what they know.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think that indie publishing leads to an indirect incentive to improve play. As a freelancer for WotC, no effort has ever been made to get me to run games at conventions, and it seems clear to me that the way to be financially successful would be to devote all my time to writing and none to playing or playtesting. As a freelancer for a smaller outfit (Goodman Games), the company has paid my plane fare from NYC to Houston to run at conventions, and doing a tournament to support books I'd worked on was highly encouraged. And as a self-publisher, I am hella incentivized to run games of Adventurer Conqueror King wherever I go and over Google+ when I'm not there, and I can attest that this actual play feeds back into the texts I write for myself much more directly than it does when I write for WotC.<br/>\n<br/>\nGame stores that host gaming events are also profiting from GMs who do a good job, and stand to lose money when people suck.<br/>\n<br/>\nConventions benefit financially when GMs do a good job, but so far as I know have not developed a good system to encourage skilled ones to come back and discourage bad ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was told that a professional GM attempt in Brazil foundered over the question of how to measure player skill and compensate players for what they bring to the table. It's clear to me that one of the most important assets I could have as a professional GM is a professional player working towards the same job of facilitating a great play experience for the paying customers.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos" title="Agemegos"><img alt="Agemegos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos">Agemegos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337946/#Comment_337946" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-09T23:00:38+00:00" title="August  9, 2011 11:00PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam Smith pointed out in <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> that you don't earn good money doing what people of leisure do for fun. The market for doing fun things is always glutted with people willing to trade off low wages for having fun. The development of copyright law and of technology for enabling huge numbers of people to enjoy a single performance (printing processes, improved and larger theatres, records, movies, radio, TV, amplifiers) created a temporary exception for a small number of star writers and performers, but most writers, musicians, and I think actors still struggle financially. And the erosion of centralised control of master copies and reproducing equipment means that the wealth of star writers, actors, and musicians may not be with us for much longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus it is with gaming technique, I think. It's very difficult to make commercial because it is a leisure activity, and the service is not reproducible nor suitable to deliver to a large audience all at once. Professional GMs or other players are always going to be poor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat leaves improving mechanics and content, i.e. publishing better rules sets, settings, and modules.

Most professions that focus on personal interaction include a lot of practice and evaluation of that practice; teaching, therapy and sales springing to mind as examples.  You can read a book, listen to a lecture or watch a demonstration, but the only way to polish the skills you are learning is to have someone watch and evaluate you.  That doesn't mean extensive review, but a couple times at least.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337954/#Comment_337954" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T00:54:23+00:00" title="August 10, 2011 12:54AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2011 12:56AM by johnzo.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Nobody gets paid when a GM does a great job.</blockquote>\nJason, I don't understand this point at all.

Does this happen?<br><br>Because I tend to think that Agemegos (and Adam Smith) are right, this just isn't a thing that can be made into a commodity.  But if you could tap into the same hobbyist, social-networky groove that brings people into gaming in the first place, that might work.  Find those places where the community-minded gamers are already congregating and talking, and get them talking about how to be better at playing and running games.  Give them the space and the encouragement to run with that, and they might use it.  I mean, people apparently sign up for GM Conferences whenever they're available, so there's at least SOME interest floating around out there to get this ball rolling.  Maybe start by setting aside space and time for people who are already interested in this stuff to get together and talk about it, with the expectation that if it goes really well, they'll be taking what they've learned back to other people and talking about how wonderful the experience was so that more people will show up for it next time.<br><br>If it's true that being better at gaming is highly rewarding -- and I think it is -- then this should produce a lot of very enthusiastic pro-improvement gamers who will in turn share that enthusiasm with everyone they play with.  There still won't be any real money in it; maybe someone could write a book and give presentations at cons and pay a few bills with the proceeds, and a few game companies could figure out a way to use it for marketing purposes to move some inventory, but that's about it.  If it's going to sustain itself, it's going to have to sustain itself because it's fun and because people want to do it.  If neither of those are true, then there's definitely not enough money to make it happen despite that.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337963/#Comment_337963" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T02:31:28+00:00" title="August 10, 2011  2:31AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a financial incentive might even be self-defeating.

According to a paper in an economic journal I read, a day care centre for children in Israel had a real problem with parents being late for picking kids up, because past a certain point it meant someone having to work over their shift. So they imposed a small fine for being late\u2014and tardiness <i>increased</i>. The financial incentive seems to have kicked collecting your kid late from the mental category "offence and inconvenience to another person" to the category "service provided for a small fee".<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is disappointing for economic theorists, but the evidence is that financial incentives sometimes don't simply reinforce other reasons for doing things the way we'd like them to. I'm afraid that if players were paying me to GM that would change both their attitude and mine. And since my style relies to a great extent on getting the character-players to make the fun and not rely on the GM, I have a feeling that the changes would be for the worse. Still, I have been surprised before, and I'm game to give it a go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337973/#Comment_337973" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T04:46:04+00:00" title="August 10, 2011  4:46AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2011 4:56AM by Wordman.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>To Tavis' question: I wonder if any game company has ever done an affiliate program where GMs who drive sales are tracked and rewarded?</blockquote>\n<a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/event.aspx?x=dnd/4new/event/dndencounters" rel="nofollow">Almost.</a> Since it is too difficult to directly track "that GM caused that sale", instead the trick is to say "that GM caused play to happen publicly, so she gets swag". To work, that strategy has to assume that any exposure is better than none.<br><br>An alternative would be to reward the GM based on player feedback. This, naturally, creates incentives to collude between the players and GM, but that might not be the end of the world (hey, the customers are "engaged" with at least some aspect of your product if they are colluding). Does add an extra layer of cost, though, to administer the player feedback.<br><br>I also note that at least one company is running an <a href="http://www.shadowrun4.com/missions/" rel="nofollow">apparently successful</a> program that is similar to D&amp;D encounters, without using any incentives at all. Just the production of content appears to be enough. (I should note, however, that this company also has a <a href="http://www.catalystdemos.com/" rel="nofollow">get swag for demoing our games program</a> as well.)<br><br>Again, the point of these programs seems to be about creating new play and new players, rather than improving existing play. On the other hand, if a program takes someones "rpg skill" from "nothing" to "a little", I guess that technically "improves play".<br><br>One thing these programs could add is something like a "player of the session award", where the GM would give the "best" player for that session, and the GM herself would be rewarded for doing so. (Years ago, a D&amp;D 2E campaign I played in did this, where each player had to nominate someone else for the award. If nothing else, it certainly made the players <i>aware</i> of play quality. The knowledge that you had to come up with a nomination at the end of the game meant that you paid attention to the play quality of others.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337990/#Comment_337990" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T07:39:52+00:00" title="August 10, 2011  7:39AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I really don't think financial incentives are the way to bring about the needed change.

Behavior (i.e. "culture") only changes if a) available incentives change or b) your weighting of what is important (i.e. utility curve) changes, making existing incentives more or less attractive. As an individual, you typically only can control the latter, whereas someone outside your brain can only hope to control the former.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338011/#Comment_338011" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T08:56:52+00:00" title="August 10, 2011  8:56AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>Jason, I don't understand this point at all.

A third? How about for a year-long campaign?<br/><br/>This raises the point of where the play experience interacts with the financial payoff for its sponsor. If we imagine game companies are just trying to sell the core books, there's no incentive to keep them having fun after they buy. The desire to keep selling the customers supplements would argue for continuing to offer improved play experiences (again where "getting to play" is improved over "not playing"). The desire to quickly lose new customers - for example, to prevent them from growing into beardies who scare kids away from your retail stores - would argue for making the initial experience awesome and subsequent ones increasingly frustrating. Subscription models like Paizo's and DDI's are hard to call one way or the other; I hear people say that Paizo's subscription model is designed to suit people who don't play so they have a lot of time to read adventures and setting, and that DDI's role as a supplier of errata that's necessary to use in organized play ties people to continued engagement with a play experience that's suboptimal because the books you have at the table are increasingly inaccurate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338029/#Comment_338029" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T10:21:09+00:00" title="August 10, 2011 10:21AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>And when they do it a second time with the same group?<br/><br/>A third?<br/><br/>How about for a year-long campaign?</blockquote>\nIf you have people to play for a year-long campaign, where is the "needed improvement"?<br/><br/>If games are horrible, they tend to fall apart well before they reach 20 sessions.

(Unless you're being sarcastic and it totally flew over my head, I guess.)<br/><br/>Because here's the thing about GMing:  no one is forcing anyone to spend 6 hours (?!!) prepping anything.  Like every other silly leisure activity in the world done for fun, you make your own decisions about how much of your valuable time and effort you want to put into it, and if the amount of energy you're spending isn't adequately rewarded by the fun you have doing it, you stop.  So if for some unknowable reason someone thinks that the only way they can run a D&amp;D game is to put 6 hours into doing I don't know what kind of prep and they think it's not fun to do and/or not worth it, they move on to another game that they can be less OCD about prepping for and are happier, or they give up GMing and just play, or they take up a different hobby entirely.  Especially if the 4 hours they spend playing D&amp;D with their friends is ALSO a painful, joyless chore that they feel they need to be compensated for.<br/><br/>There's already a thing where people get paid to do stupid boring shit they wouldn't normally do for fun: they call it a job, and most people already have one or two of them and aren't all that eager to turn what's supposed to be a fun hobby into one.  Not saying that someone couldn't give it a shot (the old "professional GM" dream), but...man, that just sounds really depressing.  Spending 6 hours preparing material for 4 hours of D&amp;D when you don't even like prepping OR D&amp;D?  I can't imagine someone in the real world paying me enough money to make that seem at all attractive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338139/#Comment_338139" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T21:05:29+00:00" title="August 10, 2011  9:05PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2011 9:09PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, there are many many professions out there where the people who do the work and get paid for it love doing it. I'm a musician: I know.<br/><br/>Generally, what makes the money necessary is not the nature of the work itself (you don't have to hate doing something to get paid for it!), it's the conditions under which you work.<br/><br/>As a professional/paid GM, you're not getting paid to just play D&amp;D. You already do that on your own! You enjoy it, it's fun, maybe even a labour of love.<br/><br/>You're getting paid to:<br/><br/>* Run games (work) at a specific time, at a specific place, of the client's choosing.<br/>* Run the game that the client likes, not the one you feel like playing.<br/>* Run the game in the setting/genre of the client's choosing ("We want an adventure where we're guaranteed to kill a red dragon and score magical items, with no chance of death... but make it feel like there is... AGAIN!")<br/>* Run the game in the style or situation the client demands (e.g. playing in one-hour chunks over lunch versus hours-long all-night sessions, or playing in a smelly basement vs. playing in a loud public space)<br/>* Run the game for people who are not friends, and probably wouldn't be friends--maybe people whose outlook on life you strongly disagree with<br/>* Run the game for groups who don't get along, so you need to police or discipline them<br/>* Accomodate special requests ("I want a game of emotionally-laden romance using D&amp;D4E... but can you hack it so it's in the setting of Frank Herbert's Dune?") <br/>* Run the game as often or as infrequently as desired (but in either case, you will be expected to keep it running just as smoothly, which means keeping notes or whatever else you need to do)<br/>* Accomodate for annoying circumstances, like players dropping out, showing up late, or missing sessions<br/>etc.<br/><br/>...and maintain an expected level of enthusiasm and quality despite all those things.<br/><br/>It's not the activity itself that's the trouble. GMing may be a lot of fun for you! We love gaming, right? Even prepping for a game is tons of fun when you're excited about the game.<br/><br/>No, it's when you find yourself in a stinky, hot basement with a bunch of people you really wouldn't normally hang out with, with the player of the one character whose role the current session hinges on missing, and you've been forced to hack your D&amp;D games to include little ponies yet again... on the same night when you were supposed to take your boy/girlfriend out to dinner... <br/><br/><i>That's</i> when you realize you'd better be getting paid for this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338150/#Comment_338150" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T22:08:15+00:00" title="August 10, 2011 10:08PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>If you have people to play for a year-long campaign, where is the "needed improvement"?</blockquote>\nOkay, the point of my questions was to challenge the idea that improving play already carries with it financial incentive for a game company. It doesn't. But holy shit, I've done year long campaigns before, and I absolutely, absolutely, ABSOLUTELY needed to improve, and still need to improve, at the end of it. <br/><br/>But maybe the question is answered differently by the rest of the hobby. Maybe the rest of the hobby is absolutely satisfied with how well they're playing.  Maybe it's just a few of us who are constantly trying to do better. <br/><br/>Look, in the original thread, I was lamenting, not calling to action. To answer the OP, I don't know what it would look like. A union, a revolution? Maybe,  I don't know, I'm just a gentleman farmer retired to the country. Smart people come up with things like that.<br/><br/>As I mentioned in the other thread, we had a GM's Conference, it was amazing, we did it with zero budget, no investment whatsoever except my time and the time of the presenters.  But eventually I got tired of doing it, and nobody else wanted to do it, so we stopped doing it.  (And what good would a conference like that really do for the play of games without GMs? What good would it do for players of games that had GMs that weren't interested in GMing?  Maybe you could take some things away from it, but improving that play wouldn't be its purpose.)<br/><br/>There are other hobbies where people do it for free, but who have a lot of investment in improving what they're doing. Music's a good example. You rehearse a LOT in music, you play with many musicians, you try to get good with your fellow collaborators and in tune with what they want. You might read some books that a music book company sells you, but nobody in their right mind would say "I wonder how a music book company can financially incentivize getting amateurs to play better music." Even with the possibility of beer money not in the cards for most amateur musicians, they already want to get better and the means of getting better are well established.<br/><br/>How about something closer to home? How do you improve your World of Warcraft play? Well, you play a lot, and you vary the builds, and you go about the same kinds of situations from various directions, and you play with good players.  You might read some World of Warcraft books a World of Warcraft book company put out, (and yes, talking on message boards!) but you're also going to be watching videos, improving your equipment, experimenting and testing.<br/><br/>I think of my great grandmother, a painter. I say "a painter" although she never sold a painting and speaking objectively she probably never could. It was her abiding hobby for the last thirty years of her life. She couldn't really gain from reading painting books, she liked videos, classes, and <i>travelling</i> to locations and painting there. <br/><br/>She had no "reason" to improve. Maybe plenty of painters are like the people Rob describes - perfectly satisfied with how they're painting and seeing no reason to change.  But being satisfied is not the same as not wanting to improve, to push harder. Michael Jordan practiced basketball, A LOT.  Bobby Fischer played a shitload of chess when getting ready for a tournament.  Pearl Jam practiced their songs a hozillion times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338161/#Comment_338161" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T23:38:16+00:00" title="August 10, 2011 11:38PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2011 12:25AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>It's not the activity itself that's the trouble.

But this point was made earlier in this thread:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Agemegos</cite>The market for doing fun things is always glutted with people willing to trade off low wages for having fun. The development of copyright law and of technology for enabling huge numbers of people to enjoy a single performance (printing processes, improved and larger theatres, records, movies, radio, TV, amplifiers) created a temporary exception for a small number of star writers and performers, but most writers, musicians, and I think actors still struggle financially. And the erosion of centralised control of master copies and reproducing equipment means that the wealth of star writers, actors, and musicians may not be with us for much longer.<br/><br/>Thus it is with gaming technique, I think. It's very difficult to make commercial because it is a leisure activity, and the service is not reproducible nor suitable to deliver to a large audience all at once. Professional GMs or other players are always going to be poor.</blockquote>\nUnless something very very weird happens to the world, you shouldn't and probably won't be skipping dinner with your loved ones to GM a Pony-fied D&amp;D with awful people in a terrible basement when you could be having fun prepping and running a game you're excited about for your friends on your own schedule instead.  There's no realistic way that you could be compensated enough to offset all those inconveniences you mentioned there and earlier, because there aren't enough people willing to pay the kind of money you'd need to offset all of those things.  (And if there was, maybe you shouldn't be getting money for GMing, but rather getting money for therapy, for them or for you. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> )<br/><br/>Are there independent, professional GMs in the world?  Maybe, probably, I don't know. But I also don't know if there are any who could pay their bills by running actual games for individual groups the way you describe, though, which means that any dream of inspiring better GMing/play by appealing to the profit motive ("get better and you can charge people to do this for them!") seems a bit far-fetched.  Worth a shot if that's what you really want to try, I guess, but unless this hobby turns into some form of gambling (look at the rise of televised poker), I just don't think there's enough money there to make much of a difference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338207/#Comment_338207" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T08:20:06+00:00" title="August 11, 2011  8:20AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quite right.<br/><br/>All that comes into play only if you're seriously trying to make a living from doing what you do.<br/><br/>For a hypothetical "professional GM", that would mean, among other things, making as many contacts and impressing as many people with consistent high service as much as possible.<br/><br/>I agree it's not too likely, but it could happen.

This hits lots of the things on Paul's list, often including "Run the game for people who are not friends, and probably wouldn't be friends--maybe people whose outlook on life you strongly disagree with" and "Run the game for groups who don't get along, so you need to police or discipline them".<br/><br/>2) people who are gaming celebrities. Here (in addition to anything else) you're getting paid to let people into your personal sphere, which your other gaming activities have caused people to be excited about and value. The public face of this is when people bid to play with celebrities at charity auctions, but I gather it also happens in private on a purely for-profit basis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
