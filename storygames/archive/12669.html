It's not just the temptation of the extra Fate point that may make you want to take that treasure, it's the cost of one of your own Fate points to not do that thing the GM has asked you to do. Now, many players choose the aspect of Greedy because they want to get into this sort of trouble, so when the GM offers them this kind of Fate point reward, they'll happily take it. These players may also feel perfectly happy about paying a cost to resist their own aspect, because again, they willingly gave up that much control to the GM at the outset when they chose that aspect in the first place. These players will willingly compel themselves, and have fun doing it, even though it's a responsibility first given to the GM. But some players aren't comfortable with compels at all -- they feel as though everything pertaining to their character should be under their control and theirs alone, and the GM doesn't have any right to touch it.</blockquote>Players feeling that their character should be spared the influence of other players (or a GM) ...<br/>- could they be said to be 'broken'?<br/><br/>Is it in fact possible to maintain such a stance, or is it an illusion?<br/><br/>I believe the very idea of playing a character is to have it interact with the fiction.

The Fate chips are just something between you and the other players/GM that keep things interesting and allow you call attention to and place emphasis on parts of the game.  The only way the system breaks is if people get too stingy with awarding Fate chips, you run out, and you can't buy off a compel - a situation that, like nuclear weapons, should always remain the elephant in the room.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284500/#Comment_284500" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T14:16:40+00:00" title="August  5, 2010  2:16PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2010 2:43PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>I believe the very idea of playing a character is to have it interact with the fiction.

It's not talking about influence:  it's talking about CONTROL.  Apparently the argument there was that compels take away control of a character...and in the original thread, I think his actual stated opinion was that compels against a player <i>who has no fate points left to resist it</i> were the thing he really hates, and he wasn't too fond of having to pay fate points to resist compels, either.  (Which makes me wonder why you'd write an Aspect that you didn't <i>want</i> to be compelled by more often than not, but that's an entirely separate issue.)<br/><br/><br/>And really, the issue of player control over their own characters is so old that it has Gary Gygax's Cheeto-encrusted fingerprints on it.

I think most people will agree that it'd be silly to claim that anyone can play a character in a game without being influenced by other players, other characters, etc.; that's why no one has actually claimed such a thing.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>'An issue of preferences' you say. Is it really? Why do you propose this to be an issue of preferences?<br/></blockquote>\nThe simple answer is that some people really enjoy playing FATE and don't mind compels, and some apparently DO mind them, and I imagine there's even a wide spectrum of people who fit in between those two points.  There are games where PCs are always played by the same player, some troupe-style games, and even games where any player can control any character.  That's clearly an issue of preferences, no different from some people preferring to play medieval-esque fantasy and others liking gritty emotional drama and still others liking boardgames.  Some people are going to be wildly entertained by a game where no player "owns" a character, others are going to see that as a total deal-breaker.  Some people will love a game with shared narration, others will hate it.  And none, absolutely NONE, of those people are wrong to like what they like.<br/><br/>There's no single game that's perfectly suited for everyone everywhere at all times, and likewise no play style that's going to be perfect; everyone has to figure out what they personally enjoy and then find like-minded people to enjoy it with.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>And; could it be that such a preference is rooted in a dysfunctional idea of what a rpg is?

(And I wonder why you believe there is, and what led you to reach that conclusion!).<br/><br/>I think that there's a lot of <i>different</i> gaming out there, not all of which is to my taste and I'm glad I don't have to play in those games.  I think that if I really wanted to game with someone whose preferences weren't the same as my own, I'd want us both to be open-minded about what we want out of the experience, try to find common ground, give it our best effort, and at the end of it we'd either reach new conclusions about what we want that would allow us to have fun together, or we would say "Oh well, it was a good effort," and part ways on a friendly basis.<br/><br/><br/>Maybe I'm just not getting what you're actually asking, though.

It's about a preference for keys over aspects, as game mechanics go, not at all about whether other people should be able to influence me or not. I mean, if I wanted to be free of influence I'd sit by myself in a room and roll dice and decide what I want them to mean. The whole point of a roleplaying game is that you interact with each other, have fun, and discover new things about yourselves, the story, or whatever theme you're investigating.<br/> <br/>Take any of Vincent Baker's games as an example of games that influence you a lot while at the same time leaving you with complete control over your character's choices -- you can play the game, and if you want, you can put your character's life on the line in the attempt to get what you want. If you die, no one can say you didn't have a choice, or that you didn't know what was at stake, because the decision to put your life on the line was totally up to you. In another game, where the GM can suddenly ask you to roll some dice, then say, "okay, you failed your observation roll, and got hit by a trap for tons of damage, so... you die," I don't see the fun in it. <br/><br/>The problem I was having with Fate aspects was somewhat similar, except the GM doesn't necessarily kill me, he says, "you've got a Daredevil aspect, so you have to jump over that chasm there," or "you're Greedy so you have to steal from your best friend now," or "you believe in 'Turn the Other Cheek' so that means you've got to just stand there and watch someone kill your family." I prefer a system like keys in Lady Blackbird, or Beliefs in Burning Wheel, where you select a theme for your character and the system rewards you if you act on it, and it rewards you if you act against it too! The choice is totally up to you to interpret what your theme means and what acting on it might look like. But by all means, put my character in a tricky situation and give him a difficult choice! Influence me as much as you like, just don't *be* me or tell me what my character should choose. <br/><br/>Then again, maybe one game might be designed around the idea that nobody owns any one character, and everyone has input about how any given character should ask, then it could be different.

But some gaming may be said to be 'broken' (as in: the game not being engaging or entertaining in any way. It may still be a nice gathering of friends, of course). In classical role-playing games one reason may be that players are maintaining an illusion of total character-control. What do you think?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>There are games where PCs are always played by the same player, some troupe-style games, and even games where any player can control any character. That's clearly an issue of preferences, no different from some people preferring to play medieval-esque fantasy and others liking gritty emotional drama and still others liking boardgames. Some people are going to be wildly entertained by a game where no player "owns" a character, others are going to see that as a total deal-breaker. Some people will love a game with shared narration, others will hate it. And none, absolutely NONE, of those people are wrong to like what they like.</blockquote>Not every issue is a matter of taste, AfT. There are, of course, a lot of different ways of playing your character, often within the boundaries of one game. But then there are some bad ways of playing too. I propose to discuss one reason some games turn out bad, for a group and/or a player.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>There are players who prefer to come up with their character, and play them out along more or less the lines they envision, without any real deviations from the envisioned personal character story and certainly not with genuine risk or the possibility that their character will be meaningfully changed in ways they didn't plan. It's the player-side version of the railroad-y "my story" GM, and it's at at least somewhat common.</blockquote>Yes, some of us have been there, and even more of us have met players who fail to see that their characters has to risk death (and other changes) as much as other characters. some of these players take the slogan <i>'Your character may die'</i> too literally, and insist that <i>no other changes</i> may be inflicted on their characters. So they develop a player stance that may be described as 'passive aggressive'; opting for a passive approach to the interactive nature of the games they play, and becoming aggressively territorial when someone (usually the GM) insist on influencing their character; <i>No, my character would never do that! It would never be persuaded to do anything! It would never fall in love with such a woman! it woudl never run from a fight!</i> ... etc...<br/><br/>They may be said to block every chance of being challenged and/or surprised by their character, or indeed; the game. <br/><br/>This is, in my view, a small problem pertaining mostly to classical games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>Some sets of play preferences don't include much collaboration or challenge. They look "broken" when your idea of what an RPG is involves those things as basic assumptions.</blockquote>You are right. I have some basic assumptions about how a role-playing game plays out, ideally. It involves <i>interaction</i>, and the nature of interaction is to act in some kind of concordance; influencing and/or inspiring each other. That is my assumption.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kayfall</cite>The paragraph you quoted there is basically just saying I want to have the right to make choices for my character, and the whole compel mechanic seems to take some (but not all) of that right to choose away from me</blockquote>Yes, I know. I did not take your text as a support for my view. I quoted it to show where my ponderings originated, and as a related issue that may inform this discussion. To discuss this, and maintain an awareness of how keys may be used, is important, in my view.<br/><br/>I do not intend to point at some players and say BOO! I have met a fair share of players like this, some of them good friends, and have seen them struggle with the nature of interactive role-playing. I consider them to be misinformed or misdirected in some way, and would like to investigate how this has happened, and what can be done to help them. I do realize that they may not want my help. They could feel that they don't need any help at all, for all I know. But if they consider it a problem, and want my help, then I would be glad to assist.

Specifically in the context of aspects and compels, don't force compel them as GM.  Have some situations come up where they can self-compel.  Ask them as a positive thing about the situation rather than stressing that you are the GM <span style="text-decoration: underline;">forcing</span> them to do something.   <br/><br/>As an off-the-cuff example, say they have "Ladies Man" as an aspect.  You've got a sexy female villain, of course.  Have a scene where the two characters are in a bar and notice each other.  Ask how the player wants it to go.  Point out his aspect and suggest that it might make things interesting.   Find a compel that is interesting -- maybe their eye's meet across the room.  she signs "call me" and mouths a number, does he write it down/remember it? -- and be clear of the consequences -- when he looks up she's gone and he can't trace her.  But hey, he has her number!    Later on, you might find that the player is a bit more eager both to use the aspect proactively -- maybe I can pay a fate point to charm this NPC with some quick flirting-- rather than purely mechanically -- +2 on contacting 'cause the ladies all love him.   Over time he might be a bit more open to compels because he sees they aren't just a way to screw him -- to make his character stand idle or do stupid things.<br/><br/>Which I guess means that I'm saying that it isn't broken <span style="text-decoration: underline;">players</span>, but broken GM's that are the problem with compels.   And that the solution isn't really change the players, but making the compels more interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_284587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284587/#Comment_284587" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T06:52:39+00:00" title="August  6, 2010  6:52AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2010 6:54AM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Doug Bonar</cite>Calling them "broken" may not be a good start.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>You're right.
