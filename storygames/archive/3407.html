I'd be surprised if we go anywhere profound with it (other than "Oh shit, cards are COOL!", which I'm totally down with these days).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou start up a game by dividing all of the cards out by suits and giving each player a suit (yeah, if you have more than four players you need a second deck).  That's their own personal deck.  They draw from it and build up a reservoir of cards to resolve conflicts, but also they have a hand of used cards.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, I'd like to have the game wind down by having cards removed one by one from the system.  When people barely have enough to fight each other any more then, clearly, they've passed the climax of the story and entered into the denouement.  I was trying to figure out what the right way to do that would be, and here's my cute idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the start of the game, the GM puts a card down in the middle of the table.  That's the start of a stack ... call it, aw shit ... the Control Stack.  The person whose card (you can tell, because of the suits!) is on top of that stack is the one who mediates who succeeds, who fails, all that jazz for anything that <i>isn't</i> resolved by explicit conflict resolution.  They are the Rules-Arbiter portion of the GM Role, except when overridden by CR and the cards.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can put a card down on top of the stack if it is <i>at least</i> equal to the current card minus one.  So if the GM has a 4 of Spades on the table then you can't take control with a 2 of Hearts, but you can do so with 3 through King of Hearts.  But if you play the King of Hearts then the only things people can play to take control are their own Kings or Queens.  That way, people can <i>oh so slowly</i> inch the current level of the control card down ... but it's <i>really</i> easy to ratchet it back up.<br/>\n<br/>\nExcept that playing a high card to take control means you've got one less high card in your deck, which is a <i>big deal</i> in the conflict resolution portion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that if this were happening fairly frequently (like once a minute or so) it would bleed cards out of the system at an appropriate rate.  What I'm not 100% sure of is how conflict resolution (which is more rare than once a minute) should figure into the control stack.  Does winning a conflict give you some special ability to take over the control stack?  Perhaps with the <i>lowest</i> card that you played to win the conflict?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76954/#Comment_76954" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-21T12:16:09+00:00" title="June 21, 2007 12:16PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>  What I'm not 100% sure of is how conflict resolution (which is more rare than once a minute) should figure into the control stack.  </blockquote>\nDo you need some conflict resolution system separate from the control stack?

If you <i>must</i> use a conflict in order to adjust the Stack then it slows down the stack to such an extent that it's no longer a quick-and-easy negotiation mechanism.<br><br/>And yet, I want the conflicts to be meaningful.  I want, in fact, for stack use to sometimes <i>lead people to</i> the idea of a bigger conflict.  Like, maybe your first line of defense when someone takes over the stack is to bump back yourself (ah, lovely images of bidding wars and dollar auctions!), but your second line of defense is to go to a full-out, head-banging conflict.<br/><br/>Sorta like Bring Down the Pain in TSoY.  I think that for many, many things, a quick "I spend a card, that's how much I want it," will be enough to persuade everyone around the table that the player has earned whatever it is they want.  But for some things, the stakes just go higher than that.<br/><br/>Hrm.  Still thinking.<br/><br/>Maybe one of the benefits of a conflict should be that it allows <i>large</i> drops in the current stack value.  Working your way down from a King to any mid-range card one card at a time ... that'd be a long trek, and would be held up by people searching for just the right card ... especially hard to pull off in a partly depleted deck.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77004/#Comment_77004" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-21T17:41:01+00:00" title="June 21, 2007  5:41PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not just make it an "I'm the GM" stack and forget about "conflict resolution" altogether?<br/><br/>I mean, I know you like conflict resolution, but surely not everything you design must contain it?<br/><br/>Or maybe it does...anyhow.

That's abilities, beliefs, descriptors, all that fun stuff. Each stat is ranked from Ace to King. Writing the stats down on little post-its and sticking them to each card ought to be easy enough.<br/><br/>When you place a card on the control stack, you're saying that particular attribute is the tool with which your character takes control of the situation. The ranks of the stats don't necessarily reflect effectiveness, but they do reflect dramatic importance. They're how the character shifts the "camera" over to themselves.<br/><br/><br/>Here's another idea:<br/><br/>You can pull <i>another</i> player's card to take control of the situation in a manner similar to the scrips in Full Light, Full Steam or tagging Aspects in Spirit of the Century. That might lead to some fights without some elegant design backing it up, but it's a thought.<br/><br/><br/>Yet another idea:<br/><br/>If you want to add more fiddly bits to this system, which you might not, you could include special abilities related to mechanical situations that occasionally arise. The cards can be used normally, but if you place the card down sideways, then it activates the special ability.<br/><br/>"Return this card to your deck if it is trumped by a card of lesser rank."<br/><br/>"Earn (Resource X) when this card trumps one of greater rank."<br/><br/>"This card may be used in combination with another, using the sum of both as if it were a single card of equal rank."<br/><br/>"This card cannot trump, but if placed on top of the control deck, it reduces the rank of the controlling card by an amount equal to <i>this </i>card."
