Often these set up the situation, with some flexibility in terms of what you have available to play with. A classic type of solo game would be a patrol/recon in force mission in Colonial Adentures. You don't know when or where or even if enemy the enemy will appear.<br/><br/>When/if they do, the 2HW stuff tends to then go over to a series of reaction rolls both for your forces and the enemy forces, which will tend to chain together a rolling series of events. Sometimes, you'll start losing control of your own forces to some degree because of these. It's kind of like Vibr-o-Matic football in that sense.<br/><br/>You'll then roll with these interacting reactions, basically, until they stop, at which point you again regain some control of your own forces and can make a decision or ten, until you provoke another series of chained reactions.<br/><br/>Repeat this process until scenario ends, generally by one side or the other being forced from the field.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280889/#Comment_280889" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-15T10:32:59+00:00" title="July 15, 2010 10:32AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Clinton, there's actually a fairly strong tradition in the wargame hobby of solo play. Typically it's done with standard two player designs that don't happen to have a hidden information component simply by trying to 'switch sides' in your head and play each side by its best tactics, to see what happens.<br/><br/>There have also been many designs over the years that attempt to cater to this play style by "automating" one side, and you essentially play against the game mechanics, using charts, cards, chit pulls etc.<br/><br/>For example, Lost Frontier which I mentioned above alternates between exploration and tactical phases. During exploration you can assign your marines to different tasks within the area of the ship you've garrisoned, then make rolls to see how well they do. Tactical kicks in when you move into unexplored area, at which point you draw chits out of a cup to see what force you face or what events happen.  Hostile aliens on the board move via a simple decision tree.<br/><br/>Ambush worked in a similar fashion, you controlled your squad on the map, then as you moved you rolled on charts that referred you to paragraphs in a scenario book that would reveal enemy forces in certain locations on the map. Once the enemy was on the map, they acted according preset rules.<br/><br/>Operational level solo wargames are often 'optimization games' in that you allocate resources and then make die rolls or card pulls to add some variance, and see how thing turn out.  Think Hammurabi played with a pen &amp; paper computer.<br/><br/>Then there are games like B-17 (or its recent sequel B-29) that are pure experience generators. There are almost no decisions to make, you just work through a series of charts and procedures to tell the story of the success or failure of a bombing mission, and what members of your crew made it back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280892/#Comment_280892" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-15T10:40:49+00:00" title="July 15, 2010 10:40AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey all thanks for the suggestions so far!!!!
