Is it possible? How?<br/><br/>I'm talking about something that would look like:<br/><br/>P1: Punch!<br/>P2: Block, Kick!<br/>P1: Duck!<br/>P2: Jump, Hammer Fist!<br/>P1: Roll, Climb Up, Dramatic Pose with Contemptuous Beckoning Gesture!<br/><br/>All happening in a really rapid-fire way, each player's "turn" taking no more than a few seconds.<br/><br/>Essentially, the mechanic must have a very short "handling time", at least during the fight itself.<br/><br/>The way I have so far though of doing this is with crads. Each card has a simple, atomic, "move" on it, like "Punch", "Block", "Kick". There might be rules about when cards could be played - some only in response to other cards, that sort of thing, or only when you've played a set-up card first.<br/><br/>However, to kepe the actual combat fluid, whatever the cards might actually DO (remove "health" points, perhaps) isn't calculated until the end of this particular "round" of laying down cards. So you might lay down twenty cards each in the space of a few minutes, and then once you were both done (maybe your hands of cards are exhausted) you then <i>go back though the deck</i> in order to calculate what actually happened.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183087/#Comment_183087" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T13:02:18+00:00" title="December 12, 2008  1:02PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not just have a pool of dice like Dogs.  You roll your pool and keep it hidden from your opponent.  Bid one die for initiative or determine it randomly (e.g. I put forth a 6 for initiative and you put a 1 to conserve your high dice).<br/><br/>Now, person with initiative takes one of his remaining die in his hand (concealed) and defender does the same.  Attacker declares some narrative color ("Punch to your orbital socket!") and slams his die on the table.  Defender follows suit ("Throws up hand to block").<br/><br/>Dice are compared and if defender loses he suffers some sort of damage (perhaps he loses the die from his pool which he bid for the defense?).  If you do damage to the pool you could handle it like the Card Game "War" and go back and forth till your pool is empty or reaches a certain threshold (lost half your dice, maybe).<br/><br/>After damage is assessed you switch who is attacking and defending.<br/><br/>So, like this:<br/><br/>Mike: "I kick you in the gut" (4)<br/>Jim: "Hell no, I grab your leg and flip you over" (5)<br/><br/>Each take no more than 3 seconds to grab new dice for next exchange<br/><br/>Jim: "As you're falling I stomp the back of your skull" (6)<br/>Mike: "I try to roll out of the way but find your boot coming down far too quickly" (3)<br/><br/>Mike is somehow damaged.<br/><br/>and so on.  It would be very quick, fluid, and full of color.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183089/#Comment_183089" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T13:05:13+00:00" title="December 12, 2008  1:05PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a card game called Lunch Money (and it's sequel Beer Money) that's similar to this.

Then you narrate blows and for each narration drop a token in the bag.  Those players NOT involved in the fight can drop in tokens of either color to "vote" for who they want to win.

For all the things "story games" have done, we still aren't good at, um, "director-stance fights" (the terminology breaks down here, though, since actors and directors in a kungfu movie should have similar intentions).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183093/#Comment_183093" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T13:10:22+00:00" title="December 12, 2008  1:10PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey have you ever played Durak? It's a russian card game that could be a great source of inspiration. Basically, in each round, player A 'attacks' player B with his cards. Player A lays down one or more cards of the same number and player B has to respond by putting down cards of higher value of the same suit. The twist is that then player A can lay down extra cards with the same value as those of the previous ones.<br/><br/>For instance, suppose player A lays down a 6 of Clubs. Player B, in order to defend, has to lay down any clubs card higher than a 6 of clubs, so he lays down a 10 of clubs. Now Player A can lay down 6s or 10s to continue the attack. This can go on until player A stops the attack, player B can no longer defend or either of them run out of cards.<br/><br/>All that would be need to be done to make this a fast paced and tactical rpg combat system would be tying the cards suits and numbers to attack types and strengths of those attacks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183095/#Comment_183095" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T13:13:39+00:00" title="December 12, 2008  1:13PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mist Robed Gate...which I got to play for the first time last weekend at GoPlayPeoria...was going to be my first suggestion, Jesse.  We had some crazy kung fu battles centered around a tournament to see which hero would win the right to render judgment in a conflict between the gods.  We had crazy jumping aerial fu, we had crushing blows toppling the arena and opening up crevasses in the earth, we had people being knocked out of the arena mid leap, like striking a baseball, we had trees spontaneously growing and entangling people...all kinds of stuff...and never a pause longer than it it took someone to think of what to do next.<br/><br/>And Lunch Money brings back some memories...Thomas, that's exactly the card game you describe.  Its only weakness is that for reasons of "art" they didn't put the text on the cards.  There isn't much (its not CCG type text) but there's enough that if you don't play frequently enough to memorize them its irritating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183097/#Comment_183097" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T13:44:46+00:00" title="December 12, 2008  1:44PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wushu                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183104/#Comment_183104" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T14:26:45+00:00" title="December 12, 2008  2:26PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really must get around to buying Mist-Robed Gate at some point, since everything I have ever hard about it makes it sound completely awesome and such.<br/><br/>However, maybe I'm missing something, because the way the fight mechanics in M-RG are described above, it sounds like it's very low in handling time terms, which is great, but it also sounds like there's only three bits of narration from each side before the entire combat is resolved. I was envisioning something with a fair deal more back and forth than that.<br/><br/>I'll see what I can find out about Lunch Money too.<br/><br/>Veles and Charles, those are good mechanics ideas as well. John K, I'm not so hot on Wushu, but thanks anyway.<br/><br/>Jonathan: that's an interesting observation. You could well be right that in some sense having the characters co-operate to make the fight look more awesome is the way forward. How precisely you'd represent that mechanically, without essentially "choreographing" (that is, having pre-planning by the players) is an interesting question.<br/><br/>You'd need perhaps mechanical incentives for both a) narrating openings for other combatants (like "I'm standing right by this huge plate-glass window") and b) taking advantage of offered openings.<br/><br/>Thanks for the suggestions everyone!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183105/#Comment_183105" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T14:57:00+00:00" title="December 12, 2008  2:57PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (NB: Man, how did I forget about Fist of the Assassin, all the Brutal Poet stuff and the Kung Fu thread from earlier in the year?

The narration doesn't stop until everyone has voted...which could be really quick if someone brings the awesome, or it could take awhile if the fight resembles the Chan vs. Li marathon from Forbidden Kingdom.  Sometimes some gentle social pressure is required to make a slow voter cast their token if the narrators are losing steam, but that seemed to work pretty easily in our game.<br/><br/>This actually is a direct solution to Jonathan's issue above.  To win the votes you have to please the audience.  If you always find lame ways to claim all three of your tokens, you're likely to lose votes.  If you always try to make the other guy look bad, you're likely to lose votes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183110/#Comment_183110" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T15:24:52+00:00" title="December 12, 2008  3:24PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meserach</cite>I mean<i>really</i>fast paced.</blockquote>\nEver play Dutch Blitz?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183111/#Comment_183111" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T15:28:47+00:00" title="December 12, 2008  3:28PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about something like this:<br/><br/>Each player has a hand of cards, each with some character-specific ability on it.<br/><br/>Players take turns slapping down one card on top of another in one pile in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>It could be almost random (just shout out a move and slap down a card) or it could be more structured (slap down any card of the same colour as the current top-most card in the pile).<br/><br/>In any case, it would go fast, bam bam bam.<br/><br/>Then, only once you're done, you go through the pile, and the order of the cards determines who is hurt, who is alive, and possibly further repercussions.<br/><br/>For instance, you might have a "Drop Kick!" card, which does 5 points of damage to your opponent if and only if the card played two "slaps" earlier (thus two levels deeper in the pile) is blue.

There's a great game called <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5534" rel="nofollow">Light Speed</a> where you toss down ship cards simultaneously with your opponent.  There are advantages to having some methodology and reacting to what your opponent does, or you can also just try to play all your cards down as quickly as possible before they play a lot of their cards down and thus miss scoring opportunities.  I wondered whether someone might design a fantasy combat system around this core.  At the bottom of a long "to-do someday" list for me.  It's a great game for $5.00 - there's definitely something there that I haven't seen in any similar games.<br/><br/>I have this vision of of some Burning Wheel scripting skeleton but all the scripts are pre-written and you're choosing quickly and simultaneously from 10 of them that come up in a predetermined random order and you can just lay them down not pointing at anything or try to point the script at its counter that your opponent has already played down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ozbot" title="ozbot"><img alt="ozbot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/nCTCPKSKDL4Z7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ozbot">ozbot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183146/#Comment_183146" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T01:22:46+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  1:22AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you seen Castle Falkenstein's dueling mechanics? It's more appropriate for fencing style duels, but might give you some ideas. In general, each opponent (two players only) have a specific hand of three cards (representing attack, parry, and rest). Each players plays one against the other at the same time (attack vs parry, for example) like rock-paper-scissors. Damaged is tracked with certain combos (definitely attack vs. rest, can't remember if there was another) and the number of times you must play a rest is determined by your fencing skill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan%20Day" title="Brendan Day"><img alt="Brendan Day" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan%20Day">Brendan Day</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183166/#Comment_183166" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T08:42:14+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  8:42AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's another idea, which involves lots of shouting.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery card has text describing its master, school, and the move itself.  When you play a card, you have to shout the move at your opponent, explaining how you learned the attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your opponent has a blocking card and they manage to play it while you're still shouting at them, their card becomes a counter-attack.  They start shouting at you, and you have to recover your wits and play a card before they finish.  The counters are played on top of each other, and whoever ends up winning can strike with any of their cards in that pile.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you manage to complete your attack before your opponent counters, you can immediately play another card and launch a second attack, accompanied by more shouting.  If you manage to stun your opponent into complete silence, you just keep pummeling away until you're out of cards.<br/>\n<br/>\nCards can only follow each other if they share key words, so that the masters, schools, or general type of moves are somehow related.

The basic idea is to make the facing of cards in a deck more chaotic as a fight goes on, by way of simple flipping actions.  (Well, I thought I it was functional after a morning of working on it; but after so many edits, I'm going to assume it's still broken and maybe even more so than it was.  Doesn't help that I can't find a pack of cards anywhere in the house.  I fail as a gamer.)<br/><br/>Start with a deck of however-many cards in front of each player.  Each player may choose whether to be an aggressor or a defender; however, a fight cannot begin without at least one aggressor.  Aggressors start with their decks facing up.  Defenders start with their decks facing down.<br/><br/>During the fight, there attack actions, defense actions, and retreat actions.  Take only one of these action per turn:<br/><br/>1) Attack.  Slam the top card from your deck onto another player's deck.  Then cut their deck.  That player yelps and goes next.<br/><br/>2) Defend.  Flip your own deck and/or flip the top card of another player's deck.  That player curses and goes next.<br/><br/>3) Flee or Back Down.  Flip your own deck to end your participation in the fight.  Announce whether you flee or back down.  So long as there are at least two participants left, you can rejoin the fight, but fleeing becomes no longer an option.  Otherwise, the last person in the fight may choose to flee or stick around.<br/><br/>When a fight is over, count the number of cards that are now face-up in your own deck.  Add this to the value of the top card (even if it is face-down) to determine the potential amount of damage to your character.  If you flee, take half your potential damage (round up) as real damage and be grateful <i>if</i> you're still alive, loser.  Everyone who sticks around takes anywhere from no damage up to their potential damage, all dependent on the wishes of the healthiest among them, who then takes as much damage as the most doled out.  Bargain or threaten as you will.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183437/#Comment_183437" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-15T10:34:28+00:00" title="December 15, 2008 10:34AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there a way to adopt one of the "twitch" card games to RPG combat?
