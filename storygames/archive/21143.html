We have played WQ in three different styles.<br/><br/>1) The harem-style story was first, it is the one in the article from May 2010.  It was a large group.  The story centered around a boy who was supposed to learn farming so that he could ... get into farmer college? So it was the boy, a bunch of witches and their cats.  The "background" was that it was a witch-test "teach the boy enough about farming that he can get into farming college."  None of the witches knew anything about farming, hilarity ensued.  Every session was centered around some issue or event at the small farm they had at their disposal.  Stuff like planting a carrot field, or fixing a leaky roof.<br/><br/>2) Short episode style. GM plus one or two witch/cat pairs. Really short 40-60 minute adventures.  A short bit setting the scene, the introduction of an issue, resolving the issue, and finally friendship and cake for everyone.  There doesn't really need to be a lot of "plot" or any character development. Just a merry romp of cats and witches. And everyone knows that it will end with friendship and cake.<br/><br/>3) Traditional convention style gaming.  I have written a 4-hour adventure, which I have run a couple of times at conventions.  Two pairs of cats and witches. A mysterious event.  Traditional problem solving and adventure.<br/><br/>I find all styles enjoyable.<br/><br/>For all three styles witch-players wear mandatory witch scarves, of which I have a bag full. So that they can pick one that matches their style. Cat players wear mandatory cat ear props.  There is tea at the table, flower pattern cups is nice.  Cake is optional. Chips and sausages are right out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463545/#Comment_463545" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-24T22:13:07+00:00" title="May 24, 2017 10:13PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" rel="nofollow">Wilhelm</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Right.

"Harem" is probably my weakest suit when it comes to manga/anime, so I wasn't sure I got it from the original article.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" rel="nofollow">Wilhelm</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>2) Short episode style.

But yes, in scope it looks about right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
