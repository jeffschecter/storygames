That sounds sarcastic, but isn't intended to be. One of the reasons people have opinions about the ENnies is that gamers actually pay attention to the results. Without such attention, the award is basically just a community wanking itself. I mean, I could offer the "Wordies" to games I like, but no one would give a shit and, consequently, the award would be even more hollow than the ENnies are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280293/#Comment_280293" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T07:44:46+00:00" title="July 13, 2010  7:44AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, that's part of it too. I mean, everyone complains that the ENnies' main voting audience is super mainstream, but that's because the ENnies are sponsored by a mostly mainstream website. Does Ron Edwards even do the Ronnies any more? People were excited about those back in the day. The Indie RPG Awards get our people all excited, but there's no like, major award ceremony or anything, and it doesn't get much publicity outside of our community. That's why I asked "who awards them?" I think that goes part-in-parcel with who would care and why.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280296/#Comment_280296" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T07:53:30+00:00" title="July 13, 2010  7:53AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My ideal game award would tell me what games I should keep an eye out for, no matter how big or small.

Judges do little video spots about their actual play, where they're asked questions by someone who plays in their games.  Judges have to be able to attend the con that the awards are given at.<br/><br/><b>What would the winner<i>win,</i>anyway?</b>  A little trophy, bragging rights, and the fact that the con buys a dozen copies of the game as prizes for GMs.  The con 'sponsors' tables at Dexcon - the idea is that this game is so good that we're going to put a rolling tables for this throughout the next con (within the next year, not a whole year away). <br/><br/><b>What's the award called?<b>Judd Karlman's Positive Regard?

It works for the film industry, the music industry, and the TV industry, and besides, recognition from your peers is as valid as recognition from the public.  (Maybe even more so, since they're supposed to be better-equipped to tell how awesome something truly is.)<br/><br/>But I guess it's a good idea to decide what the actual bottom line of the whole shebang is supposed to be.  Is it a promotional tool to drive hits on websites, get discussions going about the best games of the year, and give publicity to the winners and nominees?  Is it a professional award, designed to enhance resumes and encourage good designers and companies to keep excelling in the field?  Is it a celebration, meant to look back fondly over the work of the past year and make everyone feel good about what was accomplished?  Or something else?  Or some mixture of all of these?<br/><br/>As a spectator, I tend to like awards that are a mix of celebration and promotional tool.  I like hearing people enthusiastically discuss what was great and not-so-great, and finding out about things I missed out on earlier; I also like seeing people being happy.  I <i>think</i> those goals can be accomplished both by a popular-vote award and an industry-expert award.  At a guess, I'd say that having a panel of experts might lead to better, more meaningful discussion, but possibly with less enthusiasm and volume.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wordman</cite>One of the reasons people have opinions about the ENnies is that gamers actually pay attention to the results.</blockquote>\n...do they, though?

I ran "test-drives" at local businesses with an open invite.  Anyone who was interested could sit down and play.  I ended up gaming with a lot of people I had never even met before and when all was said and done I collected opinions on the game which I used when making my nominations.  Obviously it could be biased as the quality of the game would be based on the experience of the person running the system, but I made an effort to only do the test-drives with games I had never played or run or using settings (in the case of the Savage Worlds setting test-drive) that I had never previously used.  Colonial Gothic was first, followed by Mutant City Blues using Hard Helix, Dragon Age using the adventure from the boxed set, Gaslight (using Savage Worlds - a system I have a lot of experience with), BASH Ultimate Edition (another I had experience with) and Dr. Who using an adventure written by John Bromley, an author who is contributing to a Dr. Who short story anthology.  With Savage Worlds and BASH I was careful to only have players in the group who had never used the system since I had experience running it, that way I could still get the first impressions that I was going for.  That's not to say that those were the only games I played but I took the stance last year that the best test of a game is to actually play it and I did my damnedest to follow up on that.  The other games we played were all done with my regular groups.  As to the agonizingly terrible part... I admit that I didn't do a good job with some of these.  I don't run canned scenarios very well so it was kind of awkward for me to refer to a module and I think that may have detracted from the experience a little bit.  But I learned a lot and now that I know what to expect I think I'll be able to manage the test-drives a little better if I'm picked to go again next year.  The goal is to hit at least one public, open invite game day a month using the games that are submitted.<br/><br/>But that's enough of my puffery.  I wholeheartedly agree that the games that are judged should be played and I think that you can find people willing to play far more than five games in a given period of time.  CW is taking the stance this year that <b>every</b> game that is submitted will see actual play from at least one judge.  I think that's a fantastic decision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280368/#Comment_280368" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T11:09:28+00:00" title="July 13, 2010 11:09AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, Ogre\u2019s though above is awesome.<br/>\u201cThe Industry\u201d can take care of itself, awards wise.

We should have all sorts of awards - popular vote, peer group vote, and random-person-vote awards (like Ken Hite's "Outies").  They all serve a purpose.  <br/><br/>I also see the Indie RPG Awards as being primarily about the list, with the comments being secondary, and the actual scoring last - though it is important.  RPG designers are more apt to know about the competition and follow the development of other games.  However, they still have the issue that most people are unlikely to have played the same games. I've considered various mechanisms that would narrow the field - i.e. so the Indie RPG voters would know what the leading games are and look into them before voting.  However, that seems like it would make it harder for the less well-known games to get attention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280520/#Comment_280520" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T19:59:21+00:00" title="July 13, 2010  7:59PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I rather like the character, mystique, and broad reach of the Diana Jones Award.

It's an endorsement. If you put "Diana Jones Award Winner" on the cover of your game, it means that the Diana Jones committee liked it, so you probably will too. If you put "Ennie Award Winner" on the cover, it means, "This game is popular!".</p>\n<p>It's endorsement by either an organization/individual you respect or a great mass of people, depending on the structure of the voting.</p>\n<p>So, what <em>I</em> care about is endorsement by people who my potential customers respect. Those would be game designers and science fiction authors. If Kenneth Hite or Ursula K. LeGuin were to endorse Shock: or Human Contact, it would not only make me proud, but it would also perk the ears of those who like their work and bring me new potential customers and enthusiasts.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280812/#Comment_280812" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-15T06:23:02+00:00" title="July 15, 2010  6:23AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2010 6:23AM by Elizabeth.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.
