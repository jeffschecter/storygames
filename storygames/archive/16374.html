The PCs find people in conflict, but the root of the conflict is a clash of philosophies rather than an excess of pride and sin. (Although there can be plenty of that, too!) The DitV toolbox can be used here: Reveal the burg through play. Don't pre-judge the ending. Give the NPCs motivations that anyone could understand. Give the PCs the power to decide the conflict authoritatively.<br/><br/>* Write up a big list of philosophies and beliefs drawn from each of the Planes. (And perhaps from specific Layers or Realms). For example, the belief inspired by Mount Celestia could be, "Justice tempered with mercy is the surest path to enlightenment." Pandemonium's philosophy could be, "Sanity is a polite fiction that hides the true self." (The Prime's philosophy: "Kill the monsters and take their stuff!") Have players choose a philosophy for their character from the list. Now the player has some depth to her character beyond faction affiliation, and the DM can spotlight that player's belief when the party is visiting that specific Plane. (Or Layer, or Realm.) Beliefs could give some mechanical benefit, as well; for example, +2 to a die roll once per session when the PC is acting in accordance with their belief.<br/><br/>Anyone else have any half-baked little ideas for running Planescape games?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374000/#Comment_374000" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-22T03:04:19+00:00" title="April 22, 2012  3:04AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, <a href="story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15778&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">there's this</a>, of which I was kind of the seed and Jonathan has been most of the legwork.<br/><br/>In any case, I think a sweet planar/planescape game really needs easy procedural rules for making your own planes.

In my experience, there's usually an enthusiastic GM who knows the material backwards and forwards, and players who are either passingly familiar with the setting or know nothing about it. It's really challenging for a GM to communicate that enthusiasm without burying the players in useless details, but I've seen it done well.<br/><br/>I really like the Planescape planes. Admittedly, some of that is the satisfaction of "setting mastery". Beyond that, though, I like the creative constraint of having a fixed number of major planes. If there's a community in, say, Arcadia, what's it like? How do they interact with the natives? How do they interact with (or mitigate) the hazards of the plane? How do they manifest, or contrast with, the overall philosophy of the plane? If I want a place that just doesn't fit on any known plane, I have plenty of options as to where I can put it (demiplanes, etc).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pjack" title="Pjack"><img alt="Pjack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pjack">Pjack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374031/#Comment_374031" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-22T13:34:01+00:00" title="April 22, 2012  1:34PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite>I have recently read the original source material and I find it pretty weak though, especially the factions.

I've been reading through some of the older adventures (especially "Modron March" and "Dead Gods"), and while the overall plots are solid, there's just no motivation for the PCs. Just the standard "I want to hire you to do this thing", and sometimes, not even that. There's some really obvious and terrible railroading, which I guess was par for the course for D&amp;D adventures back in the day. If I ever do get around to running Planescape again, I'll want to use those adventures as inspiration and general framework, but I'll have to completely rethink how the PCs get involved. (Including giving them the option to walk away and do something else, if they're so inclined.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374034/#Comment_374034" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-22T15:35:14+00:00" title="April 22, 2012  3:35PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans c-o</cite>In any case, I think a sweet planar/planescape game really needs easy procedural rules for making your own planes.
