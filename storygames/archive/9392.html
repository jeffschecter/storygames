Now, this isn't really much of an issue, it's a personal project, I have no desire to publish or anything.  It's just something I've been doodling on for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday I made the decision to throw it all away.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've spent so much time I feel kind of lost in it.  re-reading it I can see where my thoughts evolved as I went along.  It just took too long.  I guess there's something to be said for that whole "perfect is the enemy of Good" thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo tonight I re-read all my notes, went through everything I've written one last time, and deleted it all.  After a year stalled out I just don't think I have it in me to work back up momentum.  It just feels right to start over, knowing what I know and hope that it pours out from a fresh start.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, any advice?  Anyone else felt the need, or had a positive experience trying?  Was it the right decision? Because suddenly it feels kinda scary.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208251/#Comment_208251" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T01:30:02+00:00" title="May 20, 2009  1:30AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2009 1:31AM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No effort is ever wasted.

I wouldn't reference them in creating something new. I have a few drafts of various character creation for games, and each time I do new one, I don't consult the old ones unless I get a nagging "I know I've said this right somewhere before." I enjoy working from scratch because it forces me to re-confront the same issues, and forces me to gain a sense of consistency with them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208257/#Comment_208257" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-20T02:37:52+00:00" title="May 20, 2009  2:37AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, it's a good strategy sometimes.
