Many new to gaming. Other gamers who play video games, boardgames, wargames, LARPs, or used to play D&amp;D.;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk about the games in detail afterwards (<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11593" rel="nofollow">like my Mouse Guard game with World of Warcraft players</a>).<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople, really love social conflicts in Dogs!<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are happy to have their character\u2019s perspectives changed. They don\u2019t view it as some form of unfair \u201cmind control.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nThey feel ok losing because you actually play out the conversation. You know what points convinced you. And since you have a lot of control over if you lose (you can always escalate, pull in traits), people feel better about losing. And when they give up, they get a bonus for later. So they still feel in control and the fiction around the conflict makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same people (who had gaming experience) hate it when in other games, you make a single roll and somehow you are supposed to be convinced of something. How? What made it happen?<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone said something that blew my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne roll social conflicts are the opposite of combat in most games. 1 minute of in fiction combat may take 30 minutes to actually play out. But a one roll social conflict is the opposite. <b>What should be a 30 minute conversation in the fiction ends up taking 1 minute to play in real life.</b> And you don\u2019t really know how you got to the final result. So Dogs solves this for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they had problems with combat in Dogs. I attack. They take the blow with 3 dice and describe the damage. But we don\u2019t know the severity till after the conflict when we roll fallout.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some cases, the person thought they took fatal damage in the fiction but were mechanically ok afterwards. Other times, someone took minor fictional damage and came close to dying. They didn\u2019t hate it but they felt unlike the social conflicts (which are mechanically the same), it was unclear what was actually happening (in terms of fictional severity).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy counter to this is that the fiction matters. If someone took the blow and describes that their knee is shot out, then regardless of what they rolled for fallout, that still happened. They might not have a \u201climp 1d4\u201d trait but it still happened. Mechanically there may not be a penalty but it colors our future narration.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wargamer players responded that if there are no mechanics attached, it\u2019s not important.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne actor and another LARPer responded that if it\u2019s important, then where is the space to write \u201climp leg\u201d on the character sheet to remember to reincorporate it later.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don\u2019t know how I feel about this but I found it honest and interesting. Hence the sharing!<br/>\n<br/>\nRock,<br/>\nJohn                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260503/#Comment_260503" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-06T19:48:22+00:00" title="March  6, 2010  7:48PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is interesting. <br><br>I suppose you could roll Fallout as soon as you accumulate it and just keep a running total like Hit Points or something, and you know when you reach a certain level that you're mortally wounded or something.

There are a few reasons why these issues didn\u2019t come up with social conflicts.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking Fallout (d4s) is unlikely to lead to Long Term Fallout. If your 2 highest Fallout dice equal 7 or lower, you take Short Term Fallout. With smaller and highly temporary stakes, knowing how you\u2019ve changed is less of an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus people tend to give more often in Talking Fallout. As we play out the conversation, if someone is convinced, they give. It doesn\u2019t always play till the end.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>&gt; \u201cWhen I take the blow, I don't describe damage to myself so much as I describe the circumstances that led to it.\u201d</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThis is great advice. This is how we played Physical conflicts and it worked well. It was harder for new players and people new to roleplaying to do this with Gun conflicts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>&gt; \u201cDon't narrate anything you'd have to undo.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; \u201cI try to make the moment to moment taking of blows in Dogs something that hits a result but doesn't specify too many of the details.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; \u201cYes, a bullet made contact with you and you're bleeding, but it isn't clear while everyone is still shooting and screaming and running if you've been shot through or just grazed.\u201d</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI shared this with one person who this was their first RPG. Their initial reaction was that for them, specifically in gun fights, this lessens the impact of what they were describing so why spend so much time with it? If every shot is an unspecific glancing blow whose severity will be determined later, it makes gun conflicts less interesting or at the very least, something to spend less time describing. Of course this is also depends on personal tastes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this was coming from one person. I\u2019ll talk with a few others and see if I can learn more. In general I think it\u2019s good advice even though I personally want the fictional details to matter as much as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>&gt; \u201cI think its because in RPG land we're used to having detailed moment to moment facts about the states of our characters during combat situations.\u201d</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is true. But it\u2019s also been true so far with people who have not played RPGs. But we aren\u2019t playing in a controlled environment. If someone hasn\u2019t played before in a group with someone who has, that\u2019s worth considering.<br/>\n<br/>\nD&amp;D; hit points aren\u2019t that different than the size of your dice pool in Dogs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NoahTheDuke" title="NoahTheDuke"><img alt="NoahTheDuke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NoahTheDuke">NoahTheDuke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260559/#Comment_260559" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-07T09:26:54+00:00" title="March  7, 2010  9:26AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John:<br><br>As an example for your players, how many times in the movies does someone get shot without realizing or acknowledging it until later, when they're suddenly in pain, and then they die?

And not just writing down what kind of wound you have so you can reincorporate it later, but really any details that somebody (player or GM) thinks is important. In most games, it's usually equipment you keep track of with a list, yeah? Wounds are handled by hit points or a stress track, so you don't worry about whether your hand is broken or not. If you wrote down "broken hand" instead of necessarily marking down damage, then your wound is going to matter more in the fiction, by reincorporation. GM: "Oh, your hand is broken isn't it? That's going to make picking that lock take longer, and getting caught more likely..."<br><br>Plus after you write stuff down, and cross it off when it changes, you've got a sort-of history for your character.<br><br>On the topic everybody else seized on: I'd like to see a version of Dogs where you take physical damage right away.

As you take more, keep rolling into that pool.

And not just writing down what kind of wound you have so you can reincorporate it later, but really any details that somebody (player or GM) thinks is important. In most games, it's usually equipment you keep track of with a list, yeah? Wounds are handled by hit points or a stress track, so you don't worry about whether your hand is broken or not. If you wrote down "broken hand" instead of necessarily marking down damage, then your wound is going to matter more in the fiction, by reincorporation. GM: "Oh, your hand is broken isn't it? That's going to make picking that lock take longer, and getting caught more likely..."<br><br>Plus after you write stuff down, and cross it off when it changes, you've got a sort-of history for your character.<br><br>Totally agree! <br><br>In some of our games we use a shared playsheet to track elements to reincorporate, big changes in the fiction, and unanswered questions. At the start of sessions I will ask people to note which one unanswered question they most care about. If multiple people note 1 question, then I have a good indication of what they care about and where to take the game. If a question keeps getting no love, we fade it into the background and cross it off when we need more space.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260569/#Comment_260569" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-07T10:41:19+00:00" title="March  7, 2010 10:41AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually dig the fact that my character is up and running without knowing if he's just been fatally wounded or not.
