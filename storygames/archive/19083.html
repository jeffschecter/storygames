(That is, we humans more often hold inexact or incorrect beliefs than correct ones when it comes to complex conclusions about the nature of the world. Probably has something to do with our cognitive capabilities being optimized not for general logic and stochastics, but rather for simple observable cause-and-effect. Socrates being the wisest of the Greeks and all that.)<br/><br/>I myself do not hold this particular mistaken impression (which is not to say that I don't hold others), for the same reason you have: I regularly get complex emergence out of complex systems. Heck, TSoY is basically predicated on this very phenomenon, it'd be no different than say Heroquest-except-clumsier if it didn't have the capability to reliably produce emergent phenomena that strike through the entire campaign from deceptively simple mechanical conceits.<br/><br/>If I had to guess at where this idea might come from, it could be that it's easier to <i>not</i> get emergence from a certain type of hand-holding, over-complex game design. If the game is written in the spirit of discouraging independent invention, and instead it provides minute procedural solutions to every possible game state, then there obviously isn't room for discovery of emergent behaviour. Has more to do with the ethos of the group (adopted from a game text or not) than with the complexity of the rules system, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/summerdown" title="summerdown"><img alt="summerdown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/summerdown">summerdown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426050/#Comment_426050" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T14:03:37+00:00" title="December 19, 2013  2:03PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm very confused when I hear people say that a game needs to be rules-lite to be "emergent".</blockquote>\nIf you're thinking of my comment on the science fiction thread, I should clarify that I don't believe emergent games have to be rules-light.<br/><br/>I'm personally limiting my own search to rules-light games because I don't want to have to spend a lot of time learning to play a new game <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426053/#Comment_426053" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T14:31:14+00:00" title="December 19, 2013  2:31PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2013 2:33PM by Vernon R.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have problems with Gurps and heavier type games.  For certain people the complexity of the character sheet and long lists of skills and abilities leads to players looking to their character sheets for long periods of time trying to figure out what is achievable for the character rather than interacting with the situation at hand.  You can get around it by creating simplistic characters with few options who excel at a few different things but then play tends to get boring with the same solutions always coming up.

If they aren't easy to comprehend or not mastered yet. Having to browse multiple books to find the rules for something like "I want to jump down on him as an attack" Where you'd have to look up rules for jumping, maybe falling or impact damage and then grappling. That can take the flow out of a situation.<br/>I think it often depends where the heavy rules put their weight. Rolemaster for example just has some math and lots of tables that tell you in which of the other tables you should roll. D&amp;D3 has a multitude of character options where you really can go deep and master the system. The Dark Eye has very broad rules with different mechanics for very similar things. Like falling from anywhere and falling from a horse have different rules and jumping and failing yet again is different. Find such exceptions can get annoying, if you were just immersed into a scene. When I play such a system I make lots of handwave calls as a GM or distribute the books and knowledge amongst my players. So one of them knows much about the magic system and another is an expert on the combat rules. In that way you usually have a quick answer and the mastery in a single aspect of the rules is easier to get. Shadowrun would be another example of a game that spreads the weight over the whole system instead of stacking it for example on the combat or character development.<br/><br/>Maybe the question is not only about a system being rules heavy but being complicated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426073/#Comment_426073" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-20T03:15:30+00:00" title="December 20, 2013  3:15AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This seems more of a semantics discussion than anything else.<br/><br/>One of the typical cases I hear the word \u201cemergent\u201d applied to rules are games like Conway\u2019s Life, or Go.

The short of it is that "emergence" in systems theory (as in, cross-discipline general science of how systems work) is the name for the quality of having undesigned (non-intentional, that is) properties. A feature of the system "emerges" from the known and directly observable bits. Something being emergent is of course somewhat subjective, as the line between "designed" and "emergent" properties lies wherever you think that "obvious" or "explicit" ends.<br/><br/>This is obviously important, and a very common, universal quality of various systems. The most important single example is probably mathematics, which may be defined as the discipline of figuring out the emergent properties (called "results") of various arbitrary axiomatic sets applied to equally arbitrary structures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426079/#Comment_426079" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-20T07:10:23+00:00" title="December 20, 2013  7:10AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The problem with rules heavy systems is that the rules can get in the way of immersion.

Joseph gave an example in his OP:\n<blockquote>It happens. I've had GURPS and HERO system (which I consider Rules medium) games that spun in crazy direction once the group internalized the rules of the world. Stuff like my Blackpowder/High Mana game having the PC's invent Air Golem Self Reloading Guns, developing quick recharging mana stone/wands they sold for money, and a huge poltical impact of the PC's discovering artifact locations and turning them into an industry base.<br/></blockquote>\n1. Group plays a complex ruleset like GURPS or HERO.<br/>2. Group internalizes the rules of the world.<br/>3. The games (sessions) spin in a crazy direction (e.g., PCs discover artifact locations, turn them into an industry, creating enormous impact on the setting's politics).<br/><br/>To me, this is just a role-playing game. Pretty typical stuff, regardless of what ruleset you're playing. In fact, it's the defining factor of RPG for me: the unbounded nature of imagination as a tool of play, the interpretation of fictional consequences to tell stories. You generally don't do that in any other kind of game.<br/><br/>I'm not sure where "emergent" comes into that. Yes, those qualities often emerge from ALL role-playing games, regardless of the ruleset's "heaviness" or "lightness." \n<blockquote>I'm very confused when I hear people say that a game needs to be rules-lite to be "emergent".<br/><br/>Where is this coming from?<br/></blockquote>\nI'll throw this back at you. Where did you hear it? Got a link? I have never heard this statement before. I have heard people say a game needs to be rules-lite to be "immersive," not that I agree with that either.

Examples of such are games like <i>Under the Bed</i>, <i>My Life with Master</i>, <i>Zombie Cinema</i>, <i>Fiasco</i>, <i>1001 Nights</i>. All of those games have less emergence (measured in the amount of unexpected directions and nature that play can and does take) than a complex, wide game that can be utilized in a multitude of ways. Are you familiar with any game of that sort?<br/><br/>I have played games like the above a lot, and I can definitely say that emergent content is not a guarantee in roleplaying games, particularly in ones such as those. This is, of course, a subjective matter: I don't think that rpg content is "emergent" in any interesting way when it is expected and measured by the game design in advance. For example, merely inventing an argument about whether to run or fight in <i>Zombie Cinema</i> is not "emergent content", but rather the bare minimum to be able to play the game, and it is much easier to manage to play with such pro-forma content all the way through than it is in e.g. GURPS, which falls down and dies if there's nobody putting work into it. To reach emergence in a simple and procedural game like ZC, you need to push further and discover how rules and creative intent work off each other to produce something unique and unexpected.<br/><br/>My point is not that this is some sort of surefire recipe for getting "non-emergent" play, of course, simply because I really don't see the term itself as objective in any way. It's like calling some game yellow: I guess it has some sort of yellow-ish bits here and there, but ultimately we can only discuss the degree of yellowness it has. Same for emergent content or behaviour: is it emergent when the players of <i>My Life with Master</i> decide to play a Dracula scenario? The rulebook doesn't tell you to do exactly that, so maybe it is? On the other hand, it's exactly following procedure, and clearly the designer anticipated the eventuality, the game makes request on you to add your own creativity in this very spot, and the play never gets out of the prescribed envelope, so what's emergent about that, in the practical sense of the term, any more than about any decision in any game? There's no correct answer, we can merely say that some systems have more interesting emergent properties than others, and we pretty much merely mean that they have a bunch of properties that are not self-evident at first. Explain a system better, and the amount of emergence is actually reduced, as behaviors we would have classified as emergent are now considered obvious. "Features" instead of "emergent features".<br/><br/><i>Maybe</i> one could get at a certain sort of game design elegance by observing how much set-up one needs to produce what amount of complexity, and we might call that particularly emergent game design. For example, Go and Game of Life are often used as examples of highly emergent game design for the simple reason that they have unexpectedly simple procedural rules for the complexity of the interactions the rules imply. In other words, there is a lot of systemic complexity implied beyond the obvious you pick up by reading the rules, and this is called "emergent complexity". It's still subjective because the complexity is there whether we observe it or not, and we only call it emergent when we fail to immediately observe it, but at least we can make some difference between a simple game and a complex one: you would presumably expect less implicit complexity from a simple game than a complex one, because you're focusing on the ratio of observed complexity vs. actual complexity, instead of merely the question of whether there is any emergent content (most systems do - only the simplest systems are so obvious that humans grasp them entirely and immediately all at once), or how much of it there is.<br/><br/>(If we were merely focusing on the absolute amount of emergent content, one would assume that a more complex game would always be the "more emergent": of course you're going to have more features that only become evident in extended operation when the system is more complex and therefore has more states, operations and combinations available. This "linear amount of emergence" is not as useful a concept as "elegance", or "ratio of implicit to overt complexity", though, for many purposes.)<br/><br/>All this is of course not to say that there's any particular disagreement here about the topic - emergence can be achieved in heavy games as well, as I said up near the beginning. I guess Joe just heard something from somewhere and wanted us to affirm that we don't think that way, or something? Internet is full of stupid ideas, I hear, and we certainly can discuss them even if we don't particularly disagree with anybody about them.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426098/#Comment_426098" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-20T10:00:06+00:00" title="December 20, 2013 10:00AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played all the games you've listed except Under the Bed. <br/><br/>I understand emergence as a concept and how it's typically used in system design and in computer game design. In the case of Minecraft, when people talk about emergent play, they're saying that there's really no game there, just a few weird rules about physics, and people invent all kinds of crazy ways to play. That's not the case with RPGs, really. <br/><br/>When people talk about emergence, they mean "something happened that no one predicted," right? In a complex RPG, "emergence" is hard to define, because you already have all these moving parts. Emergence is usually a thing that is described as occurring in simpler systems. I suspect that's why someone might say that "emergence can occur" (read: something happened that no one predicted) more often in simpler games.<br/><br/>I suspect most RPGs have, at their core, something that encourages stuff that no one predicted, because of the creative nature of play. Sure, you're not going to get as much of it in a stock railroady dungeon crawl, but most D&amp;D games I've ever been in had crazy surprises no one expected from a straightforward study of the rules. <br/><br/>Really, the Fruitful Void as an idea is about emergent behavior in RPGs. That's why I think most RPGs have it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426100/#Comment_426100" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-20T10:38:00+00:00" title="December 20, 2013 10:38AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fruitful Void is related, yeah. One might say that Fruitful Void is the place that the game ideally delineates for emergent (undesigned) behaviours to occur. It's the place where the rpg designer leaves us to figure out the answer ourselves, so it's pretty much emergent by definition.<br/><br/>I do agree that all rpgs have emergence, but then I also think that all systems have emergence as long as you have a dumb enough observer, so ultimately I think that it's fair to talk about some games being more or less emergent than others. I mean, I totally think that I get less emergent behaviour in <i>Zombie Cinema</i> than in <i>Shadow of Yesterday</i>, to name two games from opposite poles that I know well. <i>Dust Devils</i> is just about in between the two. At one end of the continuum I get games that may only surprise with an unusual dice distribution or the particular creativity brought by the players, while at the other end there are games with sufficient freedom of process to have almost any aspect of the game (aside from creative agenda, I suppose) to become more and more emergent, and less and less tied down to the hints provided by the rulebook.<br/><br/>Regarding games (as opposed to systems in general), I might hazard that "emerging behaviour" is something that is necessarily possible as long as the game has not been solved. Regarding play (as opposed to games with victory conditions), the "system" we're observing is really just the creative matrix of human behaviour, so of course it's going to be immensely complex, with massive potential for emergence. Because roleplaying games are by definition (my definition, anyway) first "play" and only occasionally "game", it's no wonder if they all involve emergence as an outcome of play. To design a roleplaying game with no emergence, we would have to be able to design all ways a player might relate to the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426101/#Comment_426101" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-20T10:41:27+00:00" title="December 20, 2013 10:41AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's safe to say that all RPGs are emergent on some level.<br/><br/>On another level, we can still class RPGs as specifically "emergent", and that's what's meant here, I think.

I think that when there are specific rules for more and more in-game occurrences, this creates a chilling effect on the sort of spontaneous creativity we are talking about. That is not to say it doesn't happen, but that it happens less often because so many outcomes are prescribed.<br/>However, I feel like Adam has a strong point. All RPGs, at their core, have this emergent quality. For instance, I feel like ZC is a highly emergent game because no one I have played with has been able to predict the outcome of any single game of ZC. And I mean at any level, at the player level, at the character level, or even at the zombie level. And while there are events and rules-based constraints, these constraints inspired the players to create new and awesome content for the game. I feel awkward arguing the level of emergence with the game's creator, but I feel that strongly about it.<br/>I think every game has emergent qualities. So the measure of a thing, is not binary, but qualitative. I have played some Champions, so I feel like I have a grip on the Hero system and I felt like, during play, the ability to spontaneously add creative content to the game was curtailed by the restriction of the point-buy system and the requirement for any fictional events to mesh with the existing rules (falling, jumping, character advancement, etc.).<br/>Then again, maybe that is a misconception. Maybe it is not the rules complexity that drives this sort of "by the book" approach to inventing new content for the current game. For instance, even in simpler versions of D&amp;D, I felt this same phenomenon, where attempts to use the rules/settings in creative ways were quelled by the attempt at total coverage of all possible fictional outcomes by the rules.<br/>Still, it feels like the design has a strong influence on all of the players' (including the GM if there is one) freedom to spontaneously alter the existing setting/situation/game. Is the determiner for this: rules complexity, rules scope, or fictional precision as to how the rules interact with the setting's elements?<br/>What do you guys think?<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426106/#Comment_426106" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-20T12:48:23+00:00" title="December 20, 2013 12:48PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 20, 2013 2:40PM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that emergent gameplay requires you to draw on pre-existing rules.<br/><br/>In a rules-lite game, those rules come from a source external to the game: the common sense and shared genre assumptions of the players.<br/><br/>In a rules-heavy game, those rules are coded into the game, and must be learned.<br/><br/>For someone who hasn't learned the rules well, a rules-heavy game is a barrier to emergent gameplay.
