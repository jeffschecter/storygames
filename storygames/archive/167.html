                    I want a Bloody Roots RPG. Here's the basic idea:<br/>
<br/>
You play native inhabitants of a conquered land. It might be in South America, or Africa, or even a made-up place. The important part is this: your people have been conquered and oppressed. The "more civilized" outsiders have taken your land and your property, and try to take your pride and dignity as well. It's time to strike back.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the deal, though: this game is about how far you'd go to drive them out. What is the limit of vengeance? Does the end justify all means?<br/>
<br/>
First, you set up your culture and the invading one. Determine the level of oppression. Make a character who is connected to the suffering of your people.<br/>
<br/>
You're fighting against time, because as the oppression goes on, your people become complacent. There will be some sort of measure of this; let's call it the Machine. You roleplay and introduce NPCs on both sides, establishing a local representation of the national issue as well as a dynamic relationship map. Having connections empowers you, and if your connections get hurt, you gain Rage that allows you to strike harder at the outsiders.<br/>
<br/>
When you take action, you have the chance of stemming the tide. The more cruel and vicious your action is, the more chance you have to fight back the Machine. You get bonuses if you hurt those on the oppressor side who don't directly oppress: especially their children. Those actions are more likely to succeed. Also, you gain bonuses if you strike fear into your own people so that they support your fight for freedom (death to all traitors!).<br/>
<br/>
In between your actions, the Machine retaliates, but it cannot use force beyond what you've used. So once you start hurting their children, they can get to yours. And they gain points for the Machine, in a pre-determined way (i.e., D6 points each time or whatever). If the Machine reaches a certain level, it wins and the fight is lost; or, if it's fought back to 0, revolution sweeps the land and your people are free (though I think that the actual endgame situation might then also depend on how cruel you were, i.e., you might slide right into a dictatorship of your own people).<br/>
<br/>
When it looks like the Machine will prevail, how far will you go to preserve your way of life?                </div>

                            My friend Liam is writing a game called Dog Eat Dog which really hits this premise a lot.   It will be interesting to see how these two play out in comparison, though early playtests of Dog Eat Dog have definitely hit the issues of imperialism and colonization very well.                        </div>

                            I was actually working on a game not unlike this idea earlier, however, it was much less vicious, and a lot less powerful. <br/>
<br/>
The primary resemblance here was probably just in the use of the concept of native "naturalists" dealing with colonizing/invading "mechanists", which brings up that same sort of "against the machine" metaphor.<br/>
<br/>
I second the "write it"!                        </div>

                            I'm trying and failing to think of a real-world example of an indigenous culture successfully repelling colonialists.  Revolution, revolt, sure - but the landscape is always changed, the pitch queered forever to reflect a new world-view.  I think any happy ending for a game like this would ring false.  Maybe it is an exercise in minimizing the horror rather than triumphing over it.<br/><br/>That said, hells yeah, write it.                        </div>

                            Well, I'll write it, eventually.<br/>
<br/>
And Jason, yes, there's change. One of the changes is often that violence remains a means of resolving political conflict. There are other effects as well, naturally, and I'm not in it for a happy ending in the sense of "and so they returned to their pre-occupation, happy, peaceful lives." It'll be a darker sort of game, and you're right, that wouldn't fit.                        </div>
