Before I dig in again, I'd like to know who's played the game, and what they liked and didn't like.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245825/#Comment_245825" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T15:01:17+00:00" title="December  8, 2009  3:01PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eh.

This is just like being the Narrator in <i>Legends of Alyria</i>." What I mean by this is that all the major characters are PCs. Rather than interests being unified (PCs vs. GM), they are dispersed and pointed at each other (PC vs. PC). The Narrator just needs to coordinate the carnage. So, if you like that dynamic, then you'll like <i>Legends of Alyria</i>.<br/><br/>I'm also still pretty pleased with my setting design for the game. Today, I wouldn't worry about the "canon" section of the book versus the "examples of how to make your own stuff" section. (Also, I would have made Digger Paladins canon.) I'd also provide more instruction on how to go about setting a particular session. (The short version: pick a setting element or two that appeal to the group, then build your storymap out of those things.)<br/><br/>Mechanically, I think that game does well enough, though it definitely shows the influence that <i>Amber</i> and <i>Everway</i> had on me at the time. I might work with the die system differently, though I'd keep the weird dice. (FYI: the dice are set up so that each represents a bell curve distribution on a single die.) I'm also still really pleased with how the Trait system works, especially how the mechanically superior option is to turn someone's evil Trait against him.<br/><br/>The writing...needs work. The setting stuff is good enough, but the rules writing is painful to me these days. Ah well.<br/><br/>Also, for what it's worth, the game was essentially finished in late 2001. However, it wasn't released until late 2006. The time lapse shows. In 2001, the game was on the cutting edge of RPG theory. In 2006, it had already inspired other games (such as <i>Universalis</i> and <i>Polaris</i>) that overshadowed it, and that rightly so. I'm glad that my work could inspire those other games; however, there's this part of me that wishes I had somehow gotten the game out into the world sooner.<br/><br/>I'm available on this thread for questions, too, if you're interested.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245829/#Comment_245829" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T15:19:02+00:00" title="December  8, 2009  3:19PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No no, I think it's a very valid work. There are few games that I'd compare it to - in fact, it's pretty much <i>Alyria</i> or <i>Nine Worlds</i> if you want a high quality space fantasy narrativist game with a polished rules set.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
