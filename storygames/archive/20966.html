Looking to maybe tighten things up with some feedback.<br/><br/>I had some random input in setting these up, but most of it sprang from one roll that made Brett Mah seem religious. It kinda set a tone for the zeitgeist; a sort of religion vs science type of undercurrent in the interactions between the team's interpersonal relationships. <br/><br/>There are some elements I am on the fence about, like Dr. Corey's past with an airhead, muscle-bound boy toy. It makes her seem a bit of a maverick, but at the same time, she comes across as quite intelligent and confident (if poignant). Shacking up with a "mimbo" (a male bimbo) seems to undermine her intelligence to me. <br/><br/>There's also Brett Mah, who originally was going to be Catholic, but I ended up making Buddhist in order to make it clash with his secret (he killed an animal belonging to an endangered species in a hunting trip). The clash is inspired by The Walking Dead's "all life is precious" Zen philosophy of a character. I see him and Dr. Guerra having a nice harmony as she is sort of a seeker. <br/><br/>My only problem is him being Buddhist &amp; Asian and I don't want to turn him into a "Confucious say" stereotype inadvertently when he says something about his religion (specially with Sr. Guerra). I don't want to change his ethnicity though. <br/><br/>Dr. Guerra I'm pretty satisfied with. <br/><br/>Any feedback on these is appreciated, particularly the elements I pointed out. Let me know if you like them as is, or maybe suggest ways to fix them. <br/><br/>Thanks!  <br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16EwlwqWirDyVpboVLOxuIhG_nn7mDwwrd5kapGCp0Hg/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/16EwlwqWirDyVpboVLOxuIhG_nn7mDwwrd5kapGCp0Hg/edit?usp=sharing</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460216/#Comment_460216" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-14T14:11:35+00:00" title="February 14, 2017  2:11PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Decided to go with what I already have.
