(I don't remember who, but you have my thanks.)<br/><br/>McKee asks an oft-overlooked question: What is the substance of story?<br/><br/>All other arts have a substance \xe2\u20ac\u201c the musician has music, the woodworker has wood, the architect has concrete and wood and steel, etc. So what is the substance of story?<br/><br/>Most contemporary writing teachers would answer with the obvious: Words. And they'd point you at something like <i>The Elements of Style</i>.<br/> <br/>But there's a problem with words: A story doesn't need them. Music needs notes, woodwork needs wood, but fiction does not need words. Sometimes it uses images, sometimes it uses music, sometimes it uses statuary, sometimes it uses gestures, sometimes it uses dance, sometimes it uses words, etc.<br/> <br/>So what is the substance of story, the substance that the writer \xe2\u20ac\u201c or gamer \xe2\u20ac\u201c crafts just as the woodworker crafts wood?<br/> <br/>McKee's answer: Irony.<br/> <br/>No, not irony in the way it's currently taught in school. Not irony as you would recognize it on an English test. Not irony as an audience would recognize it in those few spots in a film or novel where the irony is blatant and so shows through. No, irony <i>all through</i> the fiction, in <i>every single scene</i>. Irony as the discrepancy between character expectation and setting reality, the interruption of routine, the gap between effort and result. According to McKee, <i>only</i> in moments of irony is meaning generated within a fiction.<br/><br/><i>Blatant</i> irony is the discrepancy between audience expectation and setting reality. But if the irony is called out \xe2\u20ac\u201c i.e., blatant \xe2\u20ac\u201c it becomes a blaring note, drawing attention to itself rather than serving the story. This blaring note is, unfortunately, what most people recognize as irony.<br/><br/>Some obvious examples from one of my favorite fantasy movies:<br/> <br/><i>Willow</i>: The title character is a mere peck (blatant irony). He's also a mere pig farmer (blatant irony). His expectation the day of the fair is to put on a good magic show, but irony \xe2\u20ac\u201c the discrepancy between expectation and reality, the interruption of routine \xe2\u20ac\u201c steps in \xe2\u20ac\u201c and the pig does not cooperate. Willow rescues a baby, an apparently compassionate act, but irony steps in and devil dogs raid the village. The village bully expects to send Willow on his lonely way, but irony steps in and the village elder nominates the bully as the expedition's leader. Willow's children are mere children, but irony steps in and they are the ones with heart enough to accompany him if only he'd let them. The baby is helpless, but irony steps in and she is <i>the</i> danger to Bavmorda's reign. The good fairy of the woods is seemingly all-powerful, but irony steps in and she needs little annoying brownies, meager pecks, and babies to do her work for her. The great sorceress is living in exile on an island hideaway, but irony steps in and she's a rat. Mad Mardigan shows himself to be great with a sword, but irony steps in and he falls down just as he's being called great. Mad Mardigan thinks himself great, but irony steps in and the troops recoiling in fear are recoiling in fear <i>at the dragon behind him</i>. Sorsha needs her mother's approval and tries to get it through loyalty, but irony steps in with fairy dust. The dutiful warrior Airk leads a host against Bavmorda, but irony steps in and it's a thief escaped from a crow's cage who wins the day. Magic looks powerful and amazing, but irony steps in and it <i>hurts</i> when Willow has to be bit for the spell ingredient of blood. Magic looks convenient, but irony steps in when Willow can't even successfully throw an acorn at a goblin. The lost city of whatever will hold a great army to save them all, but irony steps in and it's a cursed, goblin-ridden place. Soldiers ride to the rescue, but irony steps in when they're turned into pigs. Bavmorda trusted Sorsha, but irony steps in and Sorsha betrays her. Great sorceresses let great sorceries fly, but irony steps in and they're old women. Then irony steps in again and it's the lowly peck that saves the day \xe2\u20ac\u201c with the magic trick that started it all out.<br/> <br/>This isn't even scratching the surface of all the irony in a <i>simple</i> movie. All this irony is arranged into beats, scenes, sequences, and acts in a purposeful \xe2\u20ac\u201c not accidental \xe2\u20ac\u201c way. For similar reasons to musical arrangement. If notes are not hit in the right order, cacophony \xe2\u20ac\u201c boredom in the fiction viewer or reader \xe2\u20ac\u201c results. But arranged in the right order, and irony becomes <i>character</i> \xe2\u20ac\u201c i.e., characterization with meaning (the peck has unseen power), as opposed to mere characterization (a lowly, pig-farming peck).<br/> <br/>According to McKee, all stories work this way, though the best stories may be more subtle about it. Story is the workman-like arrangement of irony, noticeable only to those trained to look (just like notes are only noticeable to those trained to hear them).<br/><br/>If McKee is right \xe2\u20ac\u201c and I believe he is \xe2\u20ac\u201c then what does this mean for story games?<br/><br/>D&amp;D contains only the most blatant irony: "Ha-hah! I was once <i>1st level</i>, but now I am <i>20th</i>!"<br/><br/>The old World of Darkness does a little better: "Ha-hah! You thought angst couldn't save the world, but my katana proves you wrong!"<br/><br/>Which is, I think, why both have been disappointing story-wise. The lack of irony.<br/><br/>The new World of Darkness does a little better. With ironic mechanics: A vampire is blessed with supernatural power, but cursed with inhuman weakness \xe2\u20ac\u201c bloodlust, death by sunlight, etc. For instance, the irony is played out \xe2\u20ac\u201c and meaning created \xe2\u20ac\u201c when the all-powerful monster uses his powers to kick ass, <i>but</i> \xe2\u20ac\u201c roll dice \xe2\u20ac\u201c leaves himself hungry and lost to a bloodlust he can't control. And there's the ironic setting: A mage has world-fixing powers, but can't fix the world or even get along with his fellow mages. It is these ironic conflicts that produce meaningful play.<br/><br/>The problem is, most story games don't do much better. We rely on the dice to <i>maybe</i> create an ironic conflict result. I think the <i>maybe</i> is where some of that three hours and forty minutes of non-fun comes from. I think the twenty minutes of fun is probably fun because the game has finally gotten around to presenting some meaning \xe2\u20ac\u201c i.e., an irony. For D&amp;D, that's usually the point at which the villainous wizard or dragon or powerful what-have-you is getting what's coming to him \xe2\u20ac\u201c <i>despite</i> his apparent power. And this same irony is repeated <i>every game session</i>. In the World of Darkness, it's the point at which the PC loses to the Beast (or for the true monster, the point at which he <i>doesn't</i>).<br/><br/>I think we can do better.<br/><br/>I think irony should have mechanical ramifications, not just a GM arbitrarily urging play in ironic directions.<br/><br/>Any ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dead_tom" title="dead_tom"><img alt="dead_tom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dead_tom">dead_tom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63408/#Comment_63408" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-10T10:56:48+00:00" title="April 10, 2007 10:56AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another example of irony in play:<br/><br/>In the thread on quixotic vs. attainable goals (<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2687&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2687&amp;page=1#Item_0</a>), the scene in <i>Return of the Jedi</i> where Luke, confronting the Emperor and Darth Vader, tosses his lightsaber aside: This is an ironic action. In a game of D&amp;D, it would get Luke killed. But in the movie, it produces an ironic result: Darth Vader tosses the Emperor.<br/><br/>I don't think this is solely a matter of quixotic vs. attainable. I think this is a matter of routine vs. irony. Routine would have been Luke fighting his way through his father to the Emperor, killing the Emperor, then his father saying something like, "My son, you are the Jedi I never could be." That's the D&amp;D approach \xe2\u20ac\u201c no irony, less satisfying.<br/><br/>So the question is, how can story games encourage the creation of ironic \xe2\u20ac\u201c i.e., meaningful \xe2\u20ac\u201c moments like this?<br/><br/>Conflict resolution \xe2\u20ac\u201c as opposed to task resolution \xe2\u20ac\u201c is a good start.

The author prepares it for us. In a story game, every player typically plays part of the authorial role. So how do you acheive irony when control of the story is shared? One of the ways is through the working of the dice. The dice (or cards, or other radnomization and resolution mechanic) have the power to create irony. That's one of the main reasons (IMHO) that games have non-deterministic resolution mechanics.<br/><br/>But if we rely on the dice to <i>create</i> the irony, we are often disapointed. In D&amp;D, the dice won't surprise us that often. The 3rd level fighter will usually defeat the goblin. The dragon will kill the 3rd level fighter. When irony really gets to awesome is when there are possibilities for irony no matter which way the dice go; when winning and losing are both interesting. A good example is your typical pulp setup: when the hero wins, we get some awesome cool heroics. When he loses, he dropped into a nasty deathtrap from which escape seems impossible. Either way, the players win.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63415/#Comment_63415" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-10T11:51:54+00:00" title="April 10, 2007 11:51AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This notion of irony strikes me as far too broad, since all those other arts you mentioned - music, woodcraft, and architecture - all do the exact same thing by this standard: the unexpected chord progression or change in tempo, the realization of a seemingly-impossible design, and the creation of a great and striking statement in space all do this exact same thing, and on all the same levels.

If something is too far <i>within</i> expectations, it's dull and predictable.  Irony is the grey area on the edges, where things happen that fit with preconceptions, but are unexpected and interesting.

Suppose the interest in art lies within the exceptions to the created pattern -- what I've called irony. In music this is the unexpected chord progression and change in tempo. In architecture this is the exception to the unity that is, however, part of the unity -- e.g., the upturned corners on a Buddhist temple.<br/><br/>So suppose this definition of irony isn't unique to fiction. If so, then how does it act in story games? Obviously, it already does:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Buying off a Key in TSOY, "But only if..." in Polaris, charging and discharging thematic batteries in FLFS, the unpredictable cards in PTA -- these all produce those reversals of meaning, and do so consistently.</blockquote>\nMy quibble here is the "consistently." These techniques hit irony sometimes, sometimes even often, but not consistently enough to avoid those stretches of non-fun. Unless someone, whether GM or Player, is independently driving toward it -- i.e., outside the mechanics. Which is, to me, a design challenge.<br/><br/>In my play experience, boredom sets in when one of two things happens: the Characters are consistently getting what they want, or the Characters are consistently not getting what they want. Either can happen because both dice and cards are random and so can land the same direction repeatedly, which leads to this boredom. Which leads to this question: Why do we wait for the dice?<br/><br/>Keys and thematic batteries do seem to be tools for not waiting for the dice. The problem I have here is that they address irony only tangentially. They tempt Players toward reversals (of fortune, conscience, whatever). Reward systems can be useful, but why not integrate irony into the basic mechanic?<br/><br/>"But only if ..." in <i>Polaris</i> seems a great tool for irony, as it directly creates it, every time. And the dynamic rather than polar conflict results of <i>Shock:</i> directly increase the chances of irony coming into play.<br/><br/>*edited for typo                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63426/#Comment_63426" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-10T13:54:13+00:00" title="April 10, 2007  1:54PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Me, I posted about McKee's <i>Story</i>!

Could you explain that?<br><br>Are you talking romance novel or medieval romance?<br/><br/>I'm having a hard time seeing how any story could be interesting without irony contained within the exchanges. <br/><br/>If it's a romance novel, then every exchange where the lovers don't yet come together contains irony.<br/><br/>Example: Lucy loves Robert, but then she finds out that he's a pirate -- she can't love a pirate! (The irony -- the gap between Lucy's expectation and the truth about Donnie -- creates an obstacle to love and fuels the romantic tension.) Robert hates all noble-born, better-than-thou ladies, and Lucy's one of them. They're useless, and would be pitiful if they were worth pitying. But then he sees Lucy pick up a gun during a pitched battle, soot streaked across her cheeks -- and he falls in love with a noble-born, better-than-thou lady. (The irony -- the gap between Robert's expectation of who is worth loving and the truth of who he will love -- creates a goal for love and, again, fuels the romantic tension.) Lucy sees Robert giving an orphan his coin purse, and the last obstacle to her love for him is overthrown. (The irony -- the gap between Lucy's expectation that Robert is no good because he is a pirate and the truth about Robert -- throws Lucy into Robert's arms.) Irony is contained within every plot exchange throughout the romance. Any exchange that does not contain irony is merely exposition, or set decoration.<br/><br/>If it's a medieval romance, then every exchange along the path of the hero until he reaches his goal likewise contains irony. Rather than a negatively-charged irony it will be positively-charged, but it's still irony.<br/><br/>Example: Percival is on a quest. To find the Grail. Along the way, he sees a pavilion. Inside the pavilion is a noble-born woman who offers him wine and herself. Percival refuses. Percival is rewarded with a brooch, a token of the woman's virtue. (The irony -- the gap between the expected behavior of a woman refused and the reward he is given -- provides Percival with a tool.) Later, Percival is asked by the guardian of the Grail, "By what right do you seek the Grail?" And Percival takes off the brooch and gives it to the guardian. (The irony -- the gap between the expected worth of the brooch and its actual worth -- provides Percival with the tool to reach the Grail.)<br/><br/>Anyways, my point is that I cannot imagine a story without irony contained within every meaningful exchange. This being the case, why isn't it something explicitly worked into story games?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dead_tom" title="dead_tom"><img alt="dead_tom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dead_tom">dead_tom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63428/#Comment_63428" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-10T14:04:47+00:00" title="April 10, 2007  2:04PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>Me, I posted about McKee's<em>Story</em>!

He defines the Gap such:\n<blockquote>STORY is born in that place where the subjective and objective realms touch.</blockquote> (p 147)<br/><br/>Or, in less flowery words, the gap between what the protagonist wants, his/her desire, and the risk he/she is undertaking to get it.

These exceptions define the true unity. The true unity is, of course, the theme. This theme will gradually emerge, as ironies expose it, over the course of a story, from beginning to end.<br/><br/>This is the specific technique I'm interested in. Whatever broad definition I hinted at was accidental.\n<blockquote>You're also missing the interesting part of my post, which is the second bit.</blockquote>\nYou're right. That's because it's part of the broad definition of irony I wasn't intending to use.<br/><br/>However, yes, the broad irony between our Characters and ourselves certainly has a hand in driving role-playing. But I'm less certain that it's more important than ironies contained within the story.

I'm not sure I see how it supercedes, say, the irony created by a player driving for a particular event in the fiction of the game and seeing it go somewhere completely unexpected due to randomizers/system constraings/other-player suggestions/inspiration, etc. I mean, that was a big part of my experience of playing <i>Polaris</i>, for instance. Far bigger than any irony I experienced due to the difference between the narrative content and my real, actual life.<br/><br/>Aaron                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63773/#Comment_63773" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-13T06:04:40+00:00" title="April 13, 2007  6:04AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Aaron --<br/><br/>I *think* that we're saying the same thing.  What I meant to say was that the interaction between the real players and the fiction is the primary source of irony in the fiction, rather than interaction between two fictional elements.<br/><br/>Your example seems to be to be totally in line with what I'm saying.  I consider "a player driving for a particular event" to be totally and completely a part of the player's "real life"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kesher" title="kesher"><img alt="kesher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kesher">kesher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63785/#Comment_63785" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-13T08:11:23+00:00" title="April 13, 2007  8:11AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, okay.<br/><br/>I would agree, we're saying the same thing.
