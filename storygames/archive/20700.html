Do they want to slow down, speed up, cut the scene, linger in the scene? This is what's here. What do you do?<br/><br/>Now, part of why this works is the prep. AW, the interesting things that happen in the game, they're going to come from the fronts, the PCs, and the moves. So you have to go move, move, move -- that's where the game elements are coming from.<br/>But in D&amp;D, the interesting things are coming from the PCs and the "prep" -- the dungeon and the monsters there in. You just have to portray that dungeon faithfully and interesting things will happen.<br/><br/>This is not intended as a slight on AW or that it's doing it wrong -- it's a great game and it's doing what it needs to do. This is just something I can do in other games.<br/><br/>Also. I want to put in some DramaSystem talk here. In it, the pacing is very much controlled by the players (and also the game structure). Because there isn't really a front past the "episode themes". The characters are in a situation and then since they hate/love each other they take forever to talk things out, the end. Playing it inspired me to push this angle in D&amp;D also, to just be boring and go "Here's what you have, here's your options, what do you do?" And players go "Oh, ok" and then they go stir up some stuff.<br/><br/>No need to send in any ninjas -- the players are the ninjas!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454416/#Comment_454416" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T16:51:18+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  4:51PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2016 4:52PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait, what's the other option?<br/><br/>Okay, that was somewhat facetious, but in all honesty, "Let the players take the lead" is my most favorite and natural style of GMing.  My job is simply to help them cook up reasons to care during character creation and the beginning of play, and then provide relevant consequences for their actions thereafter.  Well, and to satisfy myself too, by injecting whatever I find cool -- but if I'm taking my lead from the players, that's inevitably something meaningful to them or at least highly interactive.<br/><br/>I only "run the game" when that Plan A stops being super fun for a moment and I need to remind the players "here's what you were up to and why, and here are some options you can pursue".  Wait, even <i>that</i> isn't really "running the game" in the classic GM sense, is it?  I guess there are times when my cool interjections and the consequences of their actions manifest in "now you have to deal with <i>this!</i>" form, which is closer to classic GMing.<br/><br/>When things are really rolling along, often I don't even talk, except to answer questions.<br/><br/>Accordingly, I never prep "stuff for the players to do" -- I ask them what they're going to do first, and then prep what they'll encounter in the process.<br/><br/>I have a GM friend who, when players are pondering what to do next, will sit in complete silence for as long as it takes so as to avoid adding any bias.  I don't do that, but having experienced it as one end of the spectrum, it doesn't feel extreme or awkward for me to take a middle position, where I am happy to be silent and wait for the players up to a certain point.  That point, for me, is just about gauging energy and enthusiasm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454417/#Comment_454417" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T16:53:27+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  4:53PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the rule of thumb for me about pacing is whether or not their having fun.

Ninjas come crashing through the door, that kind of thing. And I think lots of people do.<br/><br/>However, I think that Vincent wasn't thinking of the game or the fiction when he described the MC's function as someone who "makes moves". Rather, he was thinking of the "conversation": the actual talking real people do at the table.<br/><br/>The job of "MC, make a move" is simply to remind the MC to *say something which provokes a response from the players*. That's all it is.<br/><br/>So, when it's your turn to speak, he gives you a list of things to say. Sure, a lot of them are things which are fictional in nature, and bad stuff for the characters. But a lot of the moves are just about talking to each other: things like "offer an opportunity with or without cost", "ask provocative questions", and "tell them the possible consequences and ask".<br/><br/>These could be things like:<br/><br/>* "Hey, sounds like you guys are hanging out in the cavern while you're waiting. Since you have the time to do so, is anyone going to search the room, or are you all just standing around?"<br/>* "So, while you're in there, is anyone talking about how Lizer turned tail and fled during your last encounter, or is it just being ignored, like the proverbial elephant in the room?"<br/>* "You guys can stay here and chat - it seems safe at the moment - but I'll be making wandering monster checks every 20 minutes, just so you know."<br/><br/>The technique you mention is a common one, and a useful one. If I were playing D&amp;D and thinking about it in "AW terms", I would include that on my list of moves:<br/><br/><b>* List the available options for the party, and ask them which they'd like to do right now.</b><br/><br/>However, you are also correct that D&amp;D, played as a game with self-motivated characters moving around in a group and exploring a pre-written module (all things which are not the case in AW), does not need the GM to make a lot of "moves" the way that AW does.<br/><br/>I've seen (and GMed) games of D&amp;D where the GM is very passive. She basically sits there quietly up until the players announce they're going to do something.<br/><br/>This works because of all the other pieces of the puzzle: dwindling resources, careful tracking of time, and the need to survive, level up, and find treasure before the session ends, balanced with things like wandering monster checks and other "scheduled" dangers take the place of the GM introducing "offscreen badness" and other such drivers for play. <br/><br/>Unlike Apocalypse World, which is based around an environment which is continually in flux and full of dangers (which is well-supported by MC moves + Fronts), in a D&amp;D game of that sort it's entirely fair to say, "Ok, you guys can leave the dungeon, but then we're effectively taking a break from the game. Let me know when you're ready to enter the dungeon again!" (Because that's where the game is.)<br/><br/>This also echoes the conversation about whether we treat the game as fiction, reality, or, well, a game.<br/><br/>In AW, the players are instructed to portray their characters as "real people". Real people often avoid adventure, danger, and change in general. In D&amp;D, we do not attempt to play "real people", but, rather, <i>adventurers</i>. Simply by playing D&amp;D, we have already committed to taking action: moving our characters from safety into a dangerous environment to seek experience points. <br/><br/>"Play your characters like real people" shifts the onus to generate danger and conflict onto the MC. "Play adventurers seeking treasure" puts it on the players' shoulders, instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454471/#Comment_454471" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T21:16:18+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  9:16PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It wasn't a question <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>It was an obvervation.<br/><br/>Oh and by "leaving the dungeon" I obv meant in case there was something outside of the dungeon.

(Hence why, in AW, we could play out a character's trip to the latrine, but in D&amp;D we generally wouldn't, unless there was a chance to be attacked or to find some meaningful thing, like a clue or a bit of treasyre.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455134/#Comment_455134" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-16T21:09:27+00:00" title="July 16, 2016  9:09PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>\u2026 the party was talking in character about what to do next<br/>And I thought they were having fun and I then asked them: "do you like this?" and they said "no!

The GM asked us whether we were having fun, and the consensus was that yes, we were having fun and we wanted to try to figure things out on our own. But after another 90 minutes we were <i>still</i> talking (in character and out) about what to do next, and if the GM had asked again, "No! We're frustrated!" would have certainly been the response.\n<blockquote>In AW, the players are instructed to portray their characters as "real people".

Our group doesn't metagame much, just because that's the sort of play we gravitate toward, and the more developed PCs are "real people" who have their own agendas, and they act accordingly. The GM has cast several quest hooks that we've examined and moved on from without taking action (or by taking contrary action), simply because our characters wouldn't logically take that path. Examples include pondering the ethics of sapient giant centipedes who hunt equally sapient refugees for food, and killing an NPC guide because a player badly failed an Insight check.<br/><br/>\u2026 maybe we ought to be playing AW instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
