                    Reading a Forge thread reminded me of a problem I often have as a GM.  Here's Vincent Baker:<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">[A player asks a clarifying question about the session, because something didn't make sense.]  Yay!  I didn't think that all of this came out quite clearly in play. It was all there in my head, but it was hard to tell what I'd managed to, y'know, say.</div>
</blockquote>
<br/>
I have this problem too!  When I'm doing prep, things can get convoluted!  And there are tons of neat little things I want to bring out: foreshadowings, plot junctures players might overlook, the subtleties of a relationship-map, emotional nuance, and sometimes, as in Vincent's case, basic exposition.  I usually end up jotting down a bunch of notes, gbut  when playing the game I never take a breath long enough to check the sheet, and the notes I <i>can</i> read no longer make sense.  ("Sh. emo mangles K.A.--yuck!")<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else have this problem?  What's to be done about it?  The obvious thing to do is to level with your players, and do the, "Okay, in this scene we've got this one guy.  And here's how I'm thinking about playing him... and this is a secret from his past, yeah it's screwed up, isn't it?... and then this other stuff..." but sometimes a more traditional presentation might be better....<br/>

                            One of the things I've told new GMs over and over is "don't let your reach exceed your grasp." This, of course, is easier said than done. In general, however, if you know you can't track more than three issues in a given scene, don't set up more than three issues in a given scene. If you know that you can't separately characterize more than five different NPCs, don't make more than five NPCs important. <br><br>This does require a bit of honest self-evaluation, but the good thing about it is that it lets you grow into your more elaborate plots. If you, for example, are limiting your major NPCs to 4 at a time, it doesn't mean that you'll only have 4 in the whole game, once you've got the 4 down (or have killed them off, moved the plot, or whatever) others can come in later. <br><br>It isn't just new GMs who make this mistake either. Drowning players in characters, details, complex narrative devices, and so forth is something a lot of established GMs have problems with. There are real ways in which even if you rock as a GM you still have to deal with the limits of what your players can, or will, absorb at one time. There are reasons that movies don't drop 50 major characters on us in the first half hour, and that novels set up a slow burn on their narrative devices. So, remembering that pacing is important not just for your abilities, but for the comprehension of your players is also important. <br><br>There are some games out there which certainly help with this. PTA, for example, provides a lot of the pacing and focus between the setup of a season and the talk that goes on (in my experience, at least) around setting up and then closing down a scene. If you, as director, outright say "In this scene I want to X and Y" and players then add "Oh, and Z" then chances of getting XYZ out in the scene are pretty damn high. (Of course, this is really just a way of forcing yourself to take the breath that you talk about never taking -- giving yourself a moment to think in the middle of game. This is a generally good thing.)<br><br>The final thing I've found is, funny enough, talking about the game after the game. If you get into it with your players and they care about it (as JD notes they won't always), your players may surprise you with how much they did notice, or how powerfully (if differently) they interpreted the things you did get in game. Full misunderstandings can usually be cleared up without much fuss, and differences of opinion and interpretation can just grow into further game material. I think that this step is something people miss around gaming because while they do it around other fiction, they don't realize the importance it plays in meaning-formation.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            From a slightly different perspective... and this might be contentious... I find that it often doesn't matter.<br/>
<br/>
That is, sometimes you'll have different players with different interpretations of the events. So what? The problem is "continuity" right? What happens if, for some reason, a player has a disconnect on something? Or even that there's something illogical that happens in play?<br/>
<br/>
I've found that I'm less and less concerned about this as time goes by. Rather, you can put a lot of effort into combatting it. But, when the problems happen, you just do some sort of quick correction to make everything fit, and move on.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, in last night's game online we started a scene just subsequent to the disappearance of some major PCs from last session. One player had decided to make up a new character, a daughter of one of the disappeared characters who she played (we don't expect them back). I wanted to include this new PC, so I had an NPC direct the other PCs to her to lead them somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
In the scene that followed subsequently, presumably right thereafter, I wanted to throw in a little bang, and so had something about her brother having a problem with finding out she was in a cult. But it totally escaped me, somehow, to look into the drama brought about by the disappearance of the character's mother. Like nobody even told her.<br/>
<br/>
I realized this half-way through the scene. Apparently nobody else had - they hadn't said anything at least. But it seemed like a glaring error for somebody to come by and say, "Hey, could you take these folks on an errand" and not mention, "Oh, and, hey, your mother disappeared." Rather that should have been the first thing.<br/>
<br/>
So when I found I'd made the mistake, I narrated something like, "Your brother is obviously still somewhat distraught at having been told a few minutes ago that your mother has disappeared."<br/>
<br/>
But, know what? That still doesn't make a ton of sense. Here's the thing. I find that as long as people are being creative... you don't have to make all that much sense.<br/>
<br/>
You know, when you read myths and such, they don't always make a ton of sense. I find that playing RPGs can be like this. It's more myth-telling than story creation. I don't need three acts, or a beginning-middle-end, or any of that. I just need to have events that people find meaningful.<br/>
<br/>
So, between things not needing to make sense, and being able to fix them after the fact to the amount needed... I just don't put as much effort into trying to keep it all as straight as I used to. In part because I find that the more you try to keep things straight, the more you find gaps that you feel you have to fill. You could go on endlessly trying to make everything fit logically into the framework of realism or of a story. I'm less concerned with that than trying to get to the next fun creative point.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays.<br/>

                            James, I think it's relatively important to split this into two big chunks: (a) getting across "what's happening" -- simple physical actions and relationships, like "the big bad guy is on the other side of a gaping chasm where you cannot reach him" and (b) subtle interpretations of what's happening that you, as a GM and as a creative participant, want to include in the fiction.<br><br>Now, getting "what's happening" down pretty solid and well-understood by everybody around the table is an important thing.  Otherwise you get some very confusing problems when one player is talking about how she's whispering to the big bad guy and the other player is shouting at him across the chasm.  The best advice I know here is simply, "Take it slow, don't hesitate to reinforce what you've already said, and don't make things too spatially complicated."<br><br>On the other hand, I find that (b) is less important to "get across" to the players, because as Brand points out, they'll come up with their own interpretations, anyway.  And that's fine.  That is, in fact, one of the strongest aspects of roleplaying in my estimation: that all the players can agree on the "what happened" part, but have wildly different interpretations on why all of the what happened is significant.  Your interpretation as a GM holds no more weight than the interpretations of the other players -- at least, in the way that I enjoy roleplaying.<br><br>(Side note: different games have different weights for the correctness of the GM's interpretations.  <em>Dogs</em> tells the GM to get his hands the hell off of making moral conclusions.  <em>Blue Rose</em> requires the GM to play up moral dichotomies.  Identifying what the individual game requires of the GM can help a great deal in determining what you should be spending your time clarifying.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Funny, but I think that Blue Rose and Dogs are saying pretty much the same things, but I could be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, the counter-argument to what Joshua and I are saying here is that a particular sort of player may want the world to seem "hard" in that there are things that, despite his potential misunderstanding, have a stable existance on some level. That is, that any disagreements in understanding represent either character misunderstanding of what's going on, or player misunderstanding - the latter sort of which must be corrected when discovered.<br/>
<br/>
And I can sympathize with this objection, actually. I used to feel stronly this way. I just don't play that way any more.<br/>

                            Mike, that's what I'm getting at.  In <em>Dogs</em>, morality is to be interpreted by the players.  In <em>Blue Rose</em>, morality is a fact that is not up for (much) interpretation.  The players you mention would be more comfortable, I think, in the latter than the former.                        </div>

                            Still not making sense to me, Josh. But I'll assume that's because I don't know Blue Rose well, and I'm not understanding the distinction you're trying to make. If, in fact, Blue Rose says that Morality is X, then, yeah, that'd appeal more to the latter sort of player.<br/>
<br/>
Getting a tad off topic. The important point is that we agree that for some players it's simply not as important to have that "hard" backdrop for play as it is for others.<br/>
