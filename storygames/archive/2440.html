<p>So now, Brennan, I know that the GM does something important in MC.</p>
<p>I want to know how you can kill him anyway, because I want to play this game, and I don't live near your house anymore, and I don't know anyone who'll run your game for me.</p>
<p>How do I do it?</p>
<p>(Please feel free to reply even if you're not Brennan, but try and pretend like you are.)</p>

                            While I've never tried explicitly playing MC GMless, I believe it can work with no rules tweaking, based on my last experience of playing it.<br/><br/>I GMed a game of MC at Conception, and found myself with six players.  Given that we had to create the world, I quickly realised that there was going to be no way of running a satisfying game for that many players in four hours if we were also going to take the time to create a bunch of NPC antagonists.  The solution we went for was to limit significant characters to PCs, and to create a relationship map that would define alliances, emnities, family relationships, etc. between all the player characters.  We then started off with the joint kicker of a mysterious magical murder committed by one of the PCs (we didn't know which one at this stage) and ran from there.<br/><br/>Once we started actually playing all I did was explain rules, frame scenes and do some hand-holding during conflicts.  After the first hour, once the game had gathered some momentum and the players knew what they were doing, all I did was watch and throw in the occassional suggestion; the scenes all came about organically, so there was no need for me to frame them.  Group consensus about the appropriate use of power and magic tokens seemed to work fine, and I was never called on to do more than offer possible prices for magical definitions when the players were stuck.  By the end of the game the players had taken over so much that I had to ask them to explain the conclusion to me, as I had no idea what was going on!<br/><br/>Based on this, I'd say if you can front-load the conflicts, create strong relationships between the characters, limit the need for NPCs and make sure everyone knows the rules, the game will pretty much run itself.                        </div>

                            As an aside, Scott, I get the impression that you might have had more fun in that game if you'd been a player rather than the GM!                        </div>

                            I'd never actually considered that, Andrew.  Personally, one of my great pleasures as a GM is to get a game to the stage where players are doing enough cool stuff that I don't need to do more than keep the pace going and throw in the occassional twist.  This MC game went a bit beyond that, but the experience was so fascinating that I didn't mind it a bit.<br/><br/>Now that I think about it, all four games I ran at Conception (this, Primetime Adventures, Dogs in the Vineyard and Unknown Armies) went a bit like this.  In each case the players were so enthusiastic and creative that beyond a certain point there was little for me to do beyond a bit of scene framing and helping to wrap things up as the game reached a conclusion.  I joke about being the world's laziest GM, but it really gives me a thrill to see players getting into a game so much that the GM almost becomes superfluous.                        </div>

<p>Okay, Scott-Brennan, that's great, but it's really not answering my question. It's wonderful that you don't have to participate when you are GMing, but the thrust of my question is, GMing excludes me from playing; I don't want to do it so I can get to the part of the game that's <em>fun.</em> Let me try and rephrase.</p>
<p><em>The MC system requires that a specific player be called out to perform special different duties. This is a problem for my play group. How do we hack the system so that this is not the case?</em></p>

                            Shreyas, I probably wasn't being very clear, but the point I was trying to make was that if everyone at the table had started off knowing the game, I wouldn't have needed to GM at all.  If that had been the case, and we'd done the kind of setup I mentioned above, I could have simply created a PC as well and joined in.<br/><br/>The only thing that stops this being generally applicable is that we didn't have any NPCs.  In order to make the game GMless you'd only really need to work out who plays the NPCs.  Adding details to the world can be handled by the magic and power token economy, and scene framing seems to work just find if the players take turns, rotating around the table.                        </div>

                            I think Scott has something, there. You'd need to figure out some way to rotate NPC-duty around the table, and maybe leave the GM power and magic pools available on the side, only accessible if you were playing an NPC at the time. So long as the scenes rotate between PCs, this should work. I guess what I'm suggesting is a rotating GM role, which could be shared by more than one player at any given time.                        </div>

                            One possibility would be to borrow from games like Polaris and Shock: and to have the person sitting to the left (or opposite, or whatever) of the current scene framer play the NPCs in that person's scene.  <br/><br/>The only problem with this is what to do about scenes that involve the PC that the designated NPC wrangler is playing.  The solution that springs to mind is to go around the table in order until you find the first person whose PC isn't in that scene and drop the role on them.  In the event that all the PCs are in the same scene, it's probably going to be so busy that you won't need any NPCs.                        </div>
