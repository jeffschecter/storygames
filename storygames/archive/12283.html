I'm going for a gritty, violent tone where all the players are just regular humans and even your average marine is probably more skilled than most.  How would you model vehicles for the Covenant like the Ghost and the Banshee.<br/>  For simpler vehicles, I'm considering just putting in a big "Vehicle" pool that the character can draw from on rolls associated with the vehicle, like armor or attacks, then maybe also adding additional Secrets.<br/><br/>  Does anyone have any prior experience with doing this in the Solar System?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275350/#Comment_275350" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-10T10:37:37+00:00" title="June 10, 2010 10:37AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, TSOY/SOlar System is all about people.

I like how it's rules-lite, but thanks to the Pools still has quite a bit of strategy.  I like how it is so intensely personal.  My current idea is that the players are rebels on a Covenant-infested planet.  There are no Spartans and few Marines, so it's more like the Polish underground than an action movie.<br/> <br/> Also, I think it's good for beginners because it has some things in common with CRPG's like experience points that make it a bit easier to understand quickly and just play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275676/#Comment_275676" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-12T00:38:25+00:00" title="June 12, 2010 12:38AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know Halo myself, so I don't know the nuances that would help in making this decision. Are vehicles something you own, or something that the organization owns? Are they personalized? Do you discard a vehicle and pick up a new one at the drop of a hat? If individual characters have some sort of claim to the vehicle (even if they're not literally the owners), then it seems to me that the equipment rules (whichever alternative you prefer) will cover the vehicle thing admirably. Just let anybody use any vehicle for color purposes, but actually only give mechanical impact to vehicles that are part of a specific character's identity by making them equipment. <i>Perhaps</i> allow an improvised equipment rating for using a vehicle - definitely do circumstance penalties for not having a vehicle when you could use one - of course let players make Effects out of engineering or driving Abilities or such to leverage their mastery of vehicular combat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noahtrammell" title="noahtrammell"><img alt="noahtrammell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noahtrammell">noahtrammell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275711/#Comment_275711" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-12T10:26:04+00:00" title="June 12, 2010 10:26AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Halo is an FPS so in the game itself they're really just use-and-throw-away things.

Because that will happen a lot. If it messes with your sense of "how the world works", TSoY could be a poor fit. If you're more concerned with the personal drama, then it's a great fit.<br/><br/>I could see having some kind of "Systems Diagnostics [R]" Ability, which you roll upon first "booting up" a vehicle, or whenever you sit down at the controls. You turn on the systems, run a diagnostics check, and a successful result becomes an Effect representing one of the vehicle's systems. Roll with penalty dice for damaged vehicles. Big, powerful vehicles have more different systems (Weapons, Shielding, Flight, whatever).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275902/#Comment_275902" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-14T07:18:51+00:00" title="June 14, 2010  7:18AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But then, who's really in the business of simulating how stuff really works? I mean to say, I'm not really seeing anything Noah's plan that'd be particularly difficult for TSoY. Something like a smaller vehicle defeating a larger one is exactly what you'd expect of most military drama of adventurous bent; you just need a good spiel of how greater skill and bravery overcomes the ethnically suspect opposition. The game even has procedures for it if you want that particular detail to be ultra-realistic. (That is, don't declare conflicts over things that are not genuinely dramatic conflicts in the sense meant by the mechanics - use GM powers to declare any foregone conclusions, such as how a Banshee always beats a Ghost in combat or whatever. Only put down a conflict when you have stakes, leverage and propriety for it.)<br/><br/>That said, <i>System Diagnostics (R)</i> is a cool Ability idea for a piloting-focused campaign; helps distinguish a bit between different pilots with different strengths, so a good call in that regard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275915/#Comment_275915" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-14T08:32:28+00:00" title="June 14, 2010  8:32AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, "How stuff really works" = "How stuff really works <i>in the game</i>", not in the real world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275917/#Comment_275917" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-14T08:38:10+00:00" title="June 14, 2010  8:38AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know, I'm not confused about that.
