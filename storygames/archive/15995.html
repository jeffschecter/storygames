And I'd really like to.<br/>I think your reaction is a reasonable one, given how the 4E rules focus on running well-ordered encounters and ignore any notion of story.  But I believe that every mechanic in D&amp;D (or any game, really) can drive fiction, and a large part of my DMing project is to identify the fictional opportunities within the 4E rules.  I give 4E credit for this revelation because of the huge number of fictional opportunities contained within it.<br/><br/>Specifically:<br/><br/>1. D&amp;D4E <b>quantifies risk extremely well</b>, and thus supports fiction about risk and jeopardy very well.  When facing a risky encounter with a time constraint, does the party care enough about the fictional stakes to press onward, or do they fall back?  As the DM, I want to tempt them towards risk, to place fictional stakes and opportunities in conflict with optimal game behavior. <br/><br/>Twice in the campaign I've granted gift powers to the PCs -- very potent new abilities that can settle encounters, but also impose fictional consequences.  Again, fiction is placed in coflict with game optimization. <br/><br/>2. D&amp;D4E has <b>a huge number of mechanical touch points that can be used to inform fiction.</b>  Race, class, paragon paths, religion, powers, falling damage rules...<br/><br/>Our dreadnought fighter was dumped by his infernal girlfriend because she didn't like his paragon path choice.  Since he has the ability to fall from a great height without dying, his paragon path test was to fall from a slightly greater height than he was certain to survive.  He has a Tide of Iron power that allows him to shove people on the battlefield; he has settled at least one pure-fiction scene by busting that power out at a critical moment.<br/><br/>Our battle captain attracts followers whenever he's in a civilized town and is naturally regarded as the leader of the party.  He took a Diplomacy buff feat, which informs my encounter design.  Whenever I lay down an encounter I have to think about negotiation points.  He has a teleportation power and is a magic hacker with a crazy Arcane skill bonus.  Once he used those in clever combination to teleport a devil chain-parasite out of a sky whale and completely short-circuit a line of fiction that that I was planning.<br/><br/>Somewhere along the line we figured out that our druid lives half in the spirit world and half in this world.  He's got information-gathering opportunities that the others don't, and that's a fun fictional channel to play with. <br/><br/>We have a dwarf avenger of the Raven Queen.  If any of those character choices were different, his fiction would be different.  For instance, if he wasn't a Raven Queen dude, then the kenku flock tagging along with the party would not love him so much and cackle with glee whenever he does something badass.<br/><br/>3. <b>Fictionally odd situations are potent fiction-creation opportunities</b>.  Since the rules are about encounters and not about fiction, occasionally they make for odd situations.  For instance, our fighter has a Come And Get It power that sucks surrounding enemies into neighboring squares.  The power works on any kind of enemy.  How do we fictionally justify this power working on brainless oozes?  That's a super-interesting fiction-creation challenge to me.  <br/><br/>And once we've settled it, we know more about oozes and more about the fighter's power, and we can reincorporate those details down the road.  In this way, the game really becomes our game, a game unlike any other D&amp;D game that has ever been played.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364230/#Comment_364230" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T11:07:42+00:00" title="March  1, 2012 11:07AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>Since the rules are about encounters and not about fiction, occasionally they make for odd situations.

I myself can't take 4th edition seriously as anything but a skirmish war game, but it's nice that it's working for others. This definitely has mostly to do with me not finding the fictional detail of the game compelling: it's exactly the sort of paper-thin American computer game fantasy stuff that elicits only frustration from me. No emotional connection, no creative agenda, and thus no roleplaying. This is a bit better when I actually start playing and putting in the detail, but then the game kicks me in the nuts by forcing everybody to fight life and death battles all the time, with no graceful handling of the very real possibility that the party loses a fight.<br/><br/>(Considering 4th edition a skirmish war game doesn't mean that I don't like it - I like wargames! I just don't have the social space for playing them seriously at this time of life. I've definitely considered starting up a 4th edition campaign several times, but it's always been in wargaming terms - we'd set up fights and see who wins and who loses, and in general put the system through its paces. Probably no non-combat scenes or the like.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364238/#Comment_364238" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T11:24:24+00:00" title="March  1, 2012 11:24AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnzo--<br/><br/>Can you write a self-published "DMG for the 4th Edition of the World's Most Popular Role-Playing Game"?<br/><br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>(I'm serious, though: I would love to get that shit out of 4e)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364243/#Comment_364243" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T11:34:23+00:00" title="March  1, 2012 11:34AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2012 11:35AM by Ludanto.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>This definitely has mostly to do with me not finding the fictional detail of the game compelling</blockquote>\nWhile I totally appreciate the level of focused design in 4e, the books never got me excited the way Stars Without Number or Red Tide (similar stuff, but for fantasy) have.

When you incorporate Rob Donoghue's insight that, if you give everything hit points, the successful use of a skill is just another excuse to roll damage, then you can create interesting and complex situations more or less on the fly by laying out a grid, describing a situation, and giving the PCs things to hit  (with weapons, with spells, and with skills). The interstices between those "on-stage" scenes are procedural and expository: they advance the plot by fast-forwarding through the slow parts and providing an in-game explanation for how the PCs make their entrance. Once on-stage, though, the PCs drive the fiction with their choices, and success or failure have consequences for what happens next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/salvagebar" title="salvagebar"><img alt="salvagebar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/salvagebar">salvagebar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364274/#Comment_364274" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T12:19:03+00:00" title="March  1, 2012 12:19PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2012 12:20PM by salvagebar.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="font-family: Courier New;">While playing in a fairly long 4E campaign, a lot of the methods johnzo brings up in the OP were engaged by the players and GM, especially the part about adding spice to the use of different powers as we described them.

In 3.5 they became more important, and in 4.0 they became essential.  In 3.0 it was easy for my group and me to just describe what we wanted to do, get GM aproval, and then roll with it.  In 4.0, the handling time went way up.  We had to spend time counting squares, referencing rule books to see if X effect was usable in so many squares of an enemy, remind ourselves if something was once per day or once per encounter, and so on.  It just became too much bookwork to go up and whack a guy with a mace for us.  Some people dig it.  And that's great.  There needs to be a game for them.  But for us, and me specifically, it much more like playing Battletech and much less like playing AD&amp;D.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364295/#Comment_364295" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T13:05:43+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  1:05PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2012 1:06PM by Deliverator.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love your ideas, Johnzo!<br/><br/>Perhaps my favorite idea for incentivizing non-game-optimal behavior that's tied to the fiction is from Rob Donoghue, called momentum. The idea is simple but powerful: for every consecutive encounter beyond the first that you do without taking a full rest, the group gets a cumulative +1 to hit and damage.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: salvagebar</cite>While playing in a fairly long 4E campaign, a lot of the methods johnzo brings up in the OP were engaged by the players and GM, especially the part about adding spice to the use of different powers as we described them.</blockquote>\nThat was me! I was the GM!<br/><br/>I think in the early part of the game, we did, as a group, engage reasonably well with the game fiction. As time went on, I felt like fiction-first moments started to decrease, for a couple of reasons:<br/><br/>-Settling into the mechanical certitude provided by the 4E framework / subconscious realization that<br/>-Narration fatigue, given how often you're using your powers in that game<br/>-It's fun and cool to describe a power the first time you're using it, but less cool the 78th time.<br/>-Laziness/GM burnout on my part, which lead to both less mechanical engagement from a moment-to-moment point of view, but also simply more encounters that were simply a bunch of monsters stats thrown together in accordance with the matrix in the DMG<br/>-Some changes in the player base (notably your departure, Abel\u2014not only are you a very fiction-first sort of player, but your character was the mother of one of the others, which created a nice and purely fictional tie-in*)<br/><br/>One technique I adopted later, but still fairly early on, was this thing with +1 Tokens. I've mentioned it here on S-G before, but it's been awhile and it bears repeating, because it was a good and successful innovation. Every time you missed a d20 roll by 1, narrate some bit of color to explain why/how you missed, and take a +1 token. On any later roll where you miss, you may spend one or more +1 tokens to instead hit, but again you must add some color.<br/><br/>Given that you will earn +1 tokens 5% of the time, this largely solved the narration fatigue thing\u2014it added more or less just the right amount of color-narration requirements to keep things feeling grounded in the fiction without requiring everyone to narrate every swing.\n<blockquote>What I can't understand specifically is people who criticize 4E on the grounds that the rules of 3E tie the game more firmly to the fiction, especially the combat.<sup><b>1</b></sup>I do see how 3E's matrix of feats, skills, and abilities are more complex and satisfying to navigate, in that math-crunchy way.

Here is my take: some portion of those people liked that 3E was well-balanced but that it kept Vancian spell-casting, and missed it when it was gone (which is very silly in my view). Regarding combat, 3E non-caster characters have a narrower menu of options during fights, but tend to develop more of a signature style\u2014people liked that, because it meant you could be rewarded for good build choices, without having to make good tactical choices turn-by-turn in a fight. (And caster builds could, at least potentially, work similarly, like my friend who built a Charm-focused Sorcerer. He buffed the hell out of the save DCs against his spells, and spent fights turning enemies into friends. It was hilarious--his save DCs were so high that he could often overcome the -5 to the save DC for being in open combat.) Whereas in 4E, build optimization is important, but the system expects you to make judicious use of your Encounters and Dailies no matter what your build.<br/><br/>So in short, a lot of 3E players love imagining this cool character who can run basically on autopilot during combat. It allows you to concentrate more on imagining your guy doing stuff, even though the combat system itself is equally if not more fiddly\u2014that's just processing, not decision-making.<br/><br/>As an aside, what both games (3E and 4E) suffer from, IME, is any incentive at the <i>character-building</i> level (as opposed to the in-game level) to make choices to take "non-optimal" Feats and such. Even though the game could, in theory, support this idea, in practice everyone just went for combos. For example, my first-ever 3E character was a bow-wielding Halfling Cleric. I just thought it would be cool to have a bow! So I spent my Feat on Martial Weapon Proficiency: Bow, because I was so in awe of the idea of a system that would just... let me make the concept I wanted. And the game <i>does</i> allow such coolness (archer-Cleric, stealthy Paladin, or whatever). But nowadays, I would frankly never do that in a d20 game; I would take something much more optimal, like Improved Turning or whatever.<br/><br/>I'd love to introduce some sort of rule like, "When you take a Feat that isn't in a Feat-chain with any of your other Feats, and/or branch out into a new Skill, gain a get-out-of-death-free card." And then run a really deadly, RAW campaign with lots of hard fights.<br/><br/>Or, more easily, simply give people more Feat slots, but require that every other Feat be unconnected to their main class role. (You could do something similar with Skill points.) I'm planning on doing that if I ever run my "You're all Specialist Wizards!" campaign: I'll give Feats almost every level, but half of them will be meta-magic or item creation Feats, and the other half will <i>have</i> to belong to other categories.<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*A third player was the brother-in-law of Abel's character and the uncle of the third character, so that fully half the PCs were blood relatives; he also switched characters later on, which further weakened any reason the party had for staying together beyond, "We are the party."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364298/#Comment_364298" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T13:09:44+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  1:09PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2012 5:25PM by johnzo.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Abel, I think that people are really sensitive to the narratives that a game affirms.<br/><br/>4e really affirms only one narrative -- the party uses tactical play to face challenges of appropriate difficulty.  Because the rules are tightly focused on this narrative, the game feels brittle, like it must be engaged wholesale or not at all.  So if you're not on board with 4e's narrative and gameplay, the game will frustrate you.  It's a design that serves a narrow range of interest very well and alienates others.<br/><br/>3e didn't really strongly affirm any particular narrative aside from the narratives encoded in its DNA.  In attempting to provide rules for many situations, it superficially affirmed a lot of narratives.  And because it was not a focused design, play groups were more empowered to disregard the parts of the rules that didn't serve their needs.  It's a design that (IMO) serves a broad range of interests, but none in a very deep way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364300/#Comment_364300" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T13:21:13+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  1:21PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>My own view on 4E is that nothing really important should happen that's not on a battlemat.</blockquote>\nBill, this is super interesting.

The tactical battles are a lot of fun, and I enjoy them about a million times more in the context of an RPG campaign that I do in a pure wargame, but my group's 4E games tended to be a mixture of those tactical battles and freeform or near-freeform RP only mildly informed by the rules (even though the latter was exactly the kind of play we'd been trying to move away from by picking up 4E in the first place). I do think the game puts a certain amount of interesting stuff into your game as a matter of course, but it also leaves a lot of blank creative space to fill in. Being a dragonborn warlord or whatever says a lot about your character, but IIRC the text scarcely even addresses the question of why your adventuring party exists (for example).<br/><br/>I really want a game that blends some of the tactical combat of 4E with interesting mechanical support for non-combat, though I think I'm going to have to design it myself to get it quite how I want it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364311/#Comment_364311" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T13:45:23+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  1:45PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>My own view on 4E is that nothing really important should happen that's not on a battlemat</blockquote>\nI'm envisioning something like Diaspora's "non-combat" zone-maps.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364318/#Comment_364318" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T13:55:41+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  1:55PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2012 1:56PM by johnzo.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: PeterBB</cite>I've never played the game, and I'm not Bill... but why would you play that in 4e?

Sometimes being jarred by the assumptions of the system can spur creativity. Explaining tripped oozes and no-girls-allowed warrior traditions can take you places you wouldn't expect! <br/><br/>It is interesting that <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is kind of the opposite of what OD&amp;D does - since class is a mechanical touchpoint giving it a gendered name kind of encodes fiction into the mechanic but in a way that is orthogonal to the rest of the design (which probably means it's unintentional if I let myself care about that).<br/><br/>Matt's thing about settling into the mechanics is like what I meant by the educational component. Often this is "I say I care about what kids are being taught by this game to cover my real agenda" but it's definitely true that I can be taught bad habits even as an old dog. Things I observed myself doing back when I was playing 4e and Basic/OD&amp;D in about equal proportion:<br/><br/>- Not bothering to choose equipment for my 4e characters because I assumed only what was written on a character card matters, but obsessing over this in OD&amp;D.<br/>- Not running away from encounters in 4e because I assumed even when a fight seemed unbeatable that the solution was a special kind of fighting, (George Stayton cured me of this) whereas in OD&amp;D I would run from encounters that maybe could have been beat.<br/>- Making self-destruction a common drive in my 4e roleplaying because I was frustrated by the padded sumo challenge level once I developed a taste for OD&amp;D wasabi lethality.<br/><br/>Also like Matt I worked out a trick in OD&amp;D roleplaying to fight against some of the learned effects - rolling a d6 to determine character age and gender. I wasn't aware of this as a reaction to the male dominance implied in the mechanics, and I can't say I wouldn't have started doing this in the ungendered 4e environment if it killed my characters every session so making new ones that would be interesting in a short lifespan mattered.<br/><br/>Finally I am fully down with point <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, the loosey goosey way I incorporate different rules texts in OD&amp;D means risk is hard to quantify which frustrates my players as we all want to tell stories about braving lethality that is hard for all of us to gauge.<br/><br/>My take on why people think 3E supports fiction more is that heist novels are one of my favorite genres. When I say "and then you go over there and fireball the troll" in the hours-long planning sessions that we liked in 3.5, I am doing just what I imagine my character to be doing. When I say this during a combat round it is instead getting in the way of me imagining myself being in a tense combat situation. <br/><br/>Maybe some groups play 4e with a five second decision timer (like NYRB's Glantri) and a strict rule that what you say as a player is said aloud and takes game time (like Mike Mornard's OD&amp;D) - but when I was one of the authors of the 4e Player's Strategy Guide and trying to see if I could get my groups to follow the advice there, I couldn't figure out how we would do the intricate combat ballet coordination without a lot of meta-talk; my focus was entirely on getting the meta-talk to look like being in character instead of being a controlling dick.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/salvagebar" title="salvagebar"><img alt="salvagebar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/salvagebar">salvagebar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364385/#Comment_364385" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T17:43:26+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  5:43PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tavis</cite><br/>...Making self-destruction a common drive in my 4e roleplaying because I was frustrated by the padded sumo challenge level once I developed a taste for OD&amp;D wasabi lethality...<br/>...Maybe some groups play 4e with a five second decision timer (like NYRB's Glantri) and a strict rule that what you say as a player is said aloud and takes game time (like Mike Mornard's OD&amp;D)...</blockquote>\nAnd this part goes to the heart of why I want to try 1E and related games. I understand wanting a more lethal challenge out of your D&amp;D, and one-step death traps. I am curious what would happen if I say I want <i>meaningless</i> character death off the table (i.e. Sure, I failed my Jump check, and I go into the pit of insta-kill acid. I am a real person at your table, and I accept that my choice caused my character to trip and fall, but I get to shout a warning to my friends before I go under.)<br/><br/>As a game mechanic, the five-second decision timer seems interesting (there are theatre directors that use similar devices during rehearsal). Ditto with the hardcore if-you-say-it-your-character-says-it rule (even though I prefer games that allow table chatter, and HATE being told "You are not there, so your character gets no input."). However, I need to see how these rules are implemented in the moment at the table, because (in my XP) it is hard to see how it would be done without insulting the <i><b>player</b></i>.<br/><br/>``Abel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364436/#Comment_364436" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T20:38:48+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  8:38PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2012 8:40PM by Bill_White.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>My own view on 4E is that nothing really important should happen that's not on a battlemat.</blockquote>\nBill, this is super interesting.  Can you give me examples of how this might work?<br/><br/>Say the fictional stakes are the time-honored "convince the Baron to bankroll your expedition." How would that encounter work?<br/><br/>I agree that we need to stipulate for the sake of the thought-experiment that I've decided (or the table's decided--you know what I mean) that "convincing the Baron" is <b>important</b>, for some reason. We want to play it out, in other words, and with more than just a Diplomacy roll. This means that there's more than just exposition ("Here's why what you're doing matters") or establishing the mise en scene ("Here's where you are and what you have with you") happening in the scene. Fundamentally, we play it out because there's a chance to see our characters in action.<br/><br/>That means the opportunity for physical action has to be present. I'm doing this on the fly, so I outline part of a castle on the battle mat and I say, "This is Hawkmount, where the Baron holds court. It's surrounded by a moat, and there are guards here, here, and here. The drawbridge is up, of course."<br/><br/>"Can we get in?"<br/><br/>"You can't just walk in, no. Here you are right here, outside the castle." I put their minis on the edge of the map, on the road that leads to the castle.<br/><br/>So now I'm beginning to see the basics of the encounter: they have to (a) get in the castle somehow, and (b) convince the Baron to help them.<br/><br/>For getting in the castle, I do what <a href="http://rdonoghue.blogspot.com/2011/01/this-is-not-science.html" rel="nofollow">what Rob Donoghue says to do</a> and give each element defenses and hit points. <br/><br/>Actually, it's worth quoting Rob at length:\n<blockquote>When faced with a challenge, there are a few ways to approach it, but in the abstract, they break down into four different approaches:<br/><br/>First, you can try to circumvent it. You can elude it, go around or otherwise avoid engaging it on its terms.<br/>Second, you can try to manipulate, control or wrestle with it. You meet it head on and try to bring it to heel.<br/>Third, you can try to understand it. Study it, and use that knowledge against it.<br/>Fourth, you can hit it. Hard. Possibly repeatedly.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> is easy. D&amp;D already handles that really well.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%231-3&amp;Mode=like">#1-3</a> is the trick. You will generally use a skill to do one of these things, but there's no 100% correlation between which skill is used what way. There are some logical limitations, but they're situational. When you need to travel through enemy territory, Survival might be used to get around enemies (circumvent) or it might be used to try to find the best route (understand). Viewing actions through this lens of what they accomplish makes them more versatile and interesting, and definitely its more satisfying than the "skill first" approach where a player says "I use Survival!" and upon being asked "Do do what?" has to scramble for an answer. [3]<br/><br/>Experienced 4e hackers probably have already seen where I'm going, but I'll lay it out here. The 4 approaches correspond to the four defenses used by 4e. Thus:<br/><br/>1 - Circumvent - Reflex<br/>2 - Manipulate - Fortitude<br/>3 - Understand - Will<br/>4 - Smash - Armor</blockquote>\nMy PCs are 1st level, so I give a group of guards AC 15, Fort 13, Will 11, Refl 11, and 12 hp. This means that it's pretty hard to <b>fight</b> them (attack vs AC), and almost as difficult to strong-arm if I try to <b>forcefully manipulate</b> them (e.g. bull rush or strong arm them--attack vs. Fort), but not too hard to <b>control (i.e., trick)</b> (attack vs. Will) or <b>avoid</b> them (attack vs. Refl). I give the guards an attack, too: maybe +3 vs AC for 1d8+1 damage, and they can Sound the Alarm to summon more guards if the PCs directly confront them (i.e., attack vs. AC or Fort). I stat out the moat and the castle walls, too, 20 hp for the moat, 30 for the walls let's say. I think it'll be easy enough to swim the moat, so Fort 12, but hard to jump across it or tunnel under it (Refl 20) and pointless to "attack" or try to trick (although I might have to worry about a magician using Ritual Caster to try something funny like turning water to ice, which would be cool, so I set it at Will 15). When you're in the moat, the thick mud and weeds threaten pull at you, attacking Refl +3 for 1d3 damage plus immobilize (save ends). <br/><br/>You swim the moat by "attacking" it with your Athletics skill; if you beat its Fort 12, you do damage by level per the table on damage expressions in the DMG; I don't have it readily accessible, but lets say its 1d6+3 for "normal attacks" (i.e., you have the skill but it's not trained) and 1d10+3 for trained swimmers. So it'll take 2 or 3 rounds to cross the moat, unless you get stuck in the weeds (its attack is +2 vs. Refl, 1d3 damage plus immobilized, save ends). The castle walls are handled similarly. <br/><br/>Guards have a chance to spot you in the moat or on the walls if you don't roll your Reflex to beat their passive perception of 11 (same as their Will, really).<br/><br/>Smart PCs will probably try to talk their way in, in which case you're rolling Diplomacy and Bluff versus the guard's Will defense; do 12 hp of damage and they roll over. But now I know how to deal with them getting in. Maybe some PCs talk and others sneak; it's all one.<br/><br/>"Here's the Great Hall where the Baron greets petitioners; here, we'll use this mini for the Baron,"<br/><br/>Next I have to worry about them convincing the Baron, but here too I just give him some number of hit points (let's say 45 hp, because I don't want him to just roll over). I give him whatever defenses I want, interpreting them as his resistance to being browbeaten (Fort), misdirected (Refl), or psyched out (Will). His AC is high because his bodyguards intercede when he's attacked. His stern disapproval of frivolity and wastefulness lets him do "Psychic" (i.e., morale) damage to anyone trying to convince him to part with his hard-earned wealth. He  can summon guards, too, and I bet he has a court jester who can mess with the PCs minds (attack vs. Will) and bemuse them (1-3 dmg, plus dazed, save ends).<br/><br/>Of course, there's no urgency to any of that, no reason why the PCs should want to race into the keep to beard the Baron in his den. To create that, maybe there's a host of other petitioners who want the Baron to spend money on their needs: improving a mill here, helping out an impoverished relative there, and so forth. I put half a dozen of these on the map and say, "These guys are looking for the Baron; if they make too many demands on him, he won't have the money to fund the expedition." They have a Beg for Money attack they can use on the Baron; every time they hit him, they do 1d8+2 damage, but their damage isn't additive to the PCs, and they go away after they've made one successful attack. If they get him down to zero before the PCs do, the PCs fail and whatever benefit was to be obtained from the Baron's patronage is lost.<br/><br/>Now, the only reason to do something like this is if the players are going to enjoy it: maybe they've been begging for a chance to show off their social skills, or something. But all your 4E combat moves have a place in the adventure; you can use your Sly Flourish on the Baron to show off your martial finesse and convince him that you've got the skills you need to make your plan succeed, or something. It's all measured in hit points anyway. And if your players surprise you, you can create new elements of the situation--the Baroness, the court magician, the Baron's daughter's mysterious illness, and so forth--fairly readily on the fly in order to keep players engaged.<br/><br/>And so that's what I'd do: put things on the map so that anytime our attention is fully engaged with the fiction, we've got opportunities for everyone to participate in the scenario, explore the setting, and showcase their characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364466/#Comment_364466" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T23:04:36+00:00" title="March  1, 2012 11:04PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesus, can we give Mike Mearls a time machine from while he was developing 4e to today in this thread?<br/><br/>That stuff is great, Bill!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364472/#Comment_364472" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T23:35:55+00:00" title="March  1, 2012 11:35PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill, thanks for that!

So the wizard spell Sleep is "worth X damage" and is thus compared against the fighter's output and assigned a correct level and resource cost. I really doubt they'll go as far as to weaponize skills (as 5E seems to be moving in a different direction anyway), but since they're stressing they're balancing the game between "combat, exploration and interaction", it might be well possible that (frex) the rogue's ability to disarm traps will have a "damage value" behind the curtain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364525/#Comment_364525" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T05:40:00+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  5:40AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Teataine, that's just talking about the recipe for Coke that used cocaine now that there is New Coke. Doing class design for Goodman starting in the playtest period for 4E, Greg and Eytan and Brian and I reverse engineered that 4e design of class mechanics used damage output as the currency you could spend to buy fancy effects. Later, working for Wizards directly and getting access to the freelancer design specs made it explicit. Sleep was worth three dice of damage, which was spent on slowed (first failed save) and unconscious (first failed save) according to a defined list of tradeoffs. The fighter got to hit one enemy for three dice because it was a defender power, sleep hit multiple people because that was a controller power.<br/><br/>Utility powers and skill powers were a red-headed stepchild because they did not get weaponized; there were no damage tradeoffs you could make to say that immobilizing everyone in a web and escaping out a window was worth doing as much damage as it took to end a fight. I would have said until now that this is part of why they sucked - the damage tradeoff in design had as much to do with the way every class felt like the same power with alphabet soup names as did the decision to not let classes share powers with the same name like in every other edition of D&amp;D. However this thread has me thinking that maybe if we had been given some metric to say exactly how much getting reconnaisance on an enemy would reduce the risk factor of the encounter, we would have been enabled to do less bland things with utility power design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryant" title="Bryant"><img alt="Bryant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryant">Bryant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364536/#Comment_364536" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T06:36:11+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  6:36AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans c-o</cite>Jesus, can we give Mike Mearls a time machine from while he was developing 4e to today in this thread?</blockquote>\nRob Heinsoo. I'm obsessive about the credit because it's an important clue to understanding 4e D&amp;D as it was released. The idiom of 4e is <cite>Avatar</cite>, not <cite>Conan</cite>: it's set in the high powered fantasy influenced by anime and manga. I think a lot of people who felt that 4e was disconnected from the fiction were thinking of a specific vein of fiction -- namely, the stuff that other versions of D&amp;D have been set in.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tavis</cite>... the way every class felt like the same power with alphabet soup names...</blockquote>\nThis definitely doesn't match my experience, but again, the differences in the class are rooted in tactical gameplay, which is again a distinct difference from earlier D&amp;Ds.<br/><br/>Anyways. The trick to rooting tactical play in the fiction is not at all obvious, although it is really simple. I think that tactical, miniatures based play can be a tool for roleplaying, but I don't think it's reasonable to expect that people will discover them on their own, and that is clearly a flaw in 4e. I have a long post about this from a couple of years back which can be summarized as follows: "Make in character, suboptimal decisions." The thing about the battle mat is that it highlights "mistakes." I put that in quotes because they're not mistakes! They're following your character's voice, and that is not a mistake, even if it's the wrong thing to do tactically.<br/><br/>It is really hard to cut against the grain like that. It's great when the whole table is behind it, but it generates bad feeling if the table wants to play a tactical war-game, and a lot of 4e tables do want that.

I found it persuasive but your experience in play is sure valid and could mean stuff about pre-play design: maybe you chose powers that differentiated you thematically and tactically instead of ones that would have blurred your role, and maybe the developers helped by letting the ones that were coolest and most role-enforcing get away with being better optimized.

I often like 4e rules transparency where everyone does the work of counting squares together, but the reason we all like story play and I like when an evil bastard DM tells me "you can't tell if you will get there in time to save them, are you going to.try?" is that unlike counting squares it is impossible to know what the right choice will be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364553/#Comment_364553" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T07:05:21+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  7:05AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2012 7:19AM by Bill_White.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Bill, that sounds like it could be a very powerful tool for GMs to arbitrate the unexpected.  It replaces or veils a plot/narrative/fictional decision of "Can the players do that?" with a mechanical one ("Is this moat 10 HP or 100?").  Is there some basis for group consensus on what stats and quantities are reasonable (e.g. moat HP)?</blockquote>\nIf you think of hit points as a pacing mechanism, then you can establish "situational" hp either by recourse to the needs of the game ("Hmm...it should take them at least three rounds to knock this out or else there's no threat") or the fiction ("A normal person should be able to swim the moat in about a minute, assuming all goes well"). So you might figure if a normal person does 1d6+3 = 6.5 damage on a hit and hits half the time (i.e., DC 11), then they're doing 3.25 damage/round, so if a combat round is about 15 seconds, then a normal person will do 14 damage over the course of a minute. So I give the moat 10 or 15 hp. On the other hand, if I'm scaling the challenge to my characters, and I know the best of them is trained in Athletics and so will do whatever the limited damage expression in the DMG is--say it's 2d10+3, or 14 dmg/hit. And they're going to hit on a 6 or greater (.75 hit rate), meaning they'll do 10.5 hp every round on average. So if I want it to take 3 rounds to swim the moat, I set the hp at 30 or maybe even 35.<br/><br/>ETA: As far as other stats go--how hard something is to affect by various means, the thing that the players see is the number they need on the die when they roll a d20. I think in players' heads, anything above a 10 has a chance to hit unless it's hard, in which case a number higher than 15 has a chance. If it's really hard, 18, 19, or 20 are what you need. Even if something's pretty impossible, a 20 at least gives you a chance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364556/#Comment_364556" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T07:16:02+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  7:16AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't personally get why people want to see 4th edition as a game where story or characterization of your character plays a role. However, given this idea, it's always felt like a shame to me that the game completely lacks the things we take as a given in other games that are specifically designed to highlight your character's dramatic choices. It seems like a missed opportunity that the individual powers you choose for your character have no fictional background, nor is choosing them an in-fiction matter. Considering how much pain the game goes through to balance everything, it would make massive sense to then use that balance for something actually fictional and interesting. For example, it would be cool if, when my character levels up, I got to choose between powers X and Y, but instead of it just being a mechanical choice, that choice would also imply e.g. political allegiance in the game setting. Maybe we could also say that learning power X requires abasement in front of this state cult godling, while learning power Y is a matter of pilgrimage to some giant waterfall or something. I mean, what's the point of balancing all those power options so carefully if you're not then going to distinguish between them in the fiction? Roleplaying-wise, wouldn't it be much easier to just give the player one power if all the powers depict the same thing (your growing puissance in your class) in the fiction anyway? I don't understand the creative joy behind these choices, it truly seems to me like the extremely elaborate power structure is in the game strictly for the tactical skirmish game to have some variety.<br/><br/>(And yes, I am aware of the eternal refrain: I can add this to the game myself, as I could do with many other things. Seems daunting, I'd have to be extremely inspired to start mapping the massive 4th edition crunch into some setting myself.)<br/><br/>The above's just something that occurred to me while reading Tavis and Bryant, above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364557/#Comment_364557" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T07:16:52+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  7:16AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How does the Moat deal damage back?

There's a really interesting point there and two very distinct styles of play. Let's accept that in the fiction, the PC doesn't know if she's going to get there in time, even though in some games the player does know. So do you, as a player, want the narrativist control of determining whether or not your PC is taking a stupid risk... or do you want the degree of risk in the hands of the GM? No right answer, of course.<br/><br/>But more to my point: sometimes I like owning whether or not a choice is stupid. If I run across the battlefield (woo, 2 extra squares), taking opportunity attacks along the way, just to get to the side of a fallen companion -- even though the cleric who's going next could easily heal him -- that is a very distinct statement about my character. It has weight in a way that I couldn't get without a battlemap. If I say "hey, I'm running across the room, it's OK if I take some hits when I go past goblins," I am handing the narrative over to the GM. And along with that, I'm handing him the opportunity to decide how much of a risk my character was actually willing to take. If she says "OK, you can wend past most of the goblins without risk," then my character's actions have a much different feel than I intended.<br/><br/>And again, sometimes I want the GM to own the narrative space to that degree. I don't think there's a right choice here. I also will reiterate that it can very, very easily feel artificial to have your PC take a risk when you know it could be avoided, and that to me is a very relevant criticism of the battlemap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364560/#Comment_364560" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T07:24:50+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  7:24AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2012 7:26AM by Bill_White.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>How does the Moat deal damage back?

(see, the moat doesn't attack the PC; the PC "resists"--this inversion of the attack process feels more satisfying to the player). If the PC rolls too low, I give him 1d3 "fatigue" damage, which is treated like normal damage. If I think the moat is tangled with weeds and other debris that could hold up the PC, I add a Reflex-based attack that potentially immobilizes the PC, meaning it takes longer to get across and gives me more time to make Fortitude attacks.<br/><br/>Remember, it's all on the same map; there is no "later"--guards could be shooting arrows at the PC <i>now</i>, while another PC is trying to sneak past them to lower the drawbridge.

When I've DMed my own custom dungeons, I tend to completely ignore alignment except for things like demons; if something is humanoid, it's going to be at least sort of reasonable and amenable to diplomacy, provided the terms offered are favorable enough. <br/><br/>Case in point, I ran a dungeon called Lair of the Cyclops, wherein the titular boss lives on the first floor, in the temple-area, and there's a goblin settlement on B2 and B3 below. When the party encountered the goblins, they put up their weapons and said, "Sorry to intrude.

Seems daunting, I'd have to be extremely inspired to start mapping the massive 4th edition crunch into some setting myself.).</blockquote>\nEero, it seems like you're suggesting that this crunch-&gt;setting mapping will require a large amount of pre-play work.  Why do it pre-play?  Why not do it during play?  That way, only the details that are relevant to the game are explored, and that exploration is inherently collaborative.<br/><br/>After twelve levels of play, our current campaign doesn't include any elves, either as PCs or NPCs or in any backstory.  There may not be any elves in our world, or they may be welll-hidden, or whatever.  We'll figure it out if it becomes important.

I don't see how they are better at driving the narrative, so if someone who has that point of view can point out a few places to start, I would appreciate it.</blockquote>\nAbel, I have made this claim on several occasions. Despite this, I think 4E is a much better design, and for me, more fun to play. I have a very similar stance to Eero - I appreciate the skirmish war-game design of 4E, and if I want to engage with a game on a different level, I'd play a different game that's not a version of D&amp;D at all.<br/><br/>The reason I feel this way is quite straightforward - like most RPGs, D&amp;D 3.x associated a game element (e.g. Fighter, Fireball, Bull Rush, Otyugh) with some numbers representing their usefulness in some algorithm-driven simulation of a fantasy world, but the name of the game element stood on its own in the fiction. A Fireball was a big ball of fire, conjured by trained wizards through reading arcane incantations from a spellbook and doing something weird with bat guano. Often, these game elements had lengthy fictional descriptions associated with them, explaining how they worked in the world fictionally. The few times 3.x was more abstract than that, as with Hit Points and Alignments, it spawned decade-long flame wars and tens of thousands of house rules.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the nature of the numbers and algorithms driving the game always appeared to me to be more driven by the need for simulation than the need for game balance. A wizard started out green and useless, but 10 levels later could transform a dragon into a bunny rabbit and step on it. A warrior started out armed and dangerous, but 10 levels later they were still hacking and slashing, though maybe with a magical sword. Big scary monsters could be killed by a team of greenhorns with a smart plan and a complicit DM. In one particularly dull session, my 5th level half-orc monk killed an entirely settlement of orcs by essentially standing in the centre of town with his fist out and letting them run into it, because his AC was so high they just had no way of injuring him.<br/><br/>DnD 4E isn't relatively speaking an abstract game, but as johnzo so aptly demonstrates in the OP, it is a lot more open to interpretation than earlier editions... and as Eero points out, it-would-be-nice-if it would <em>mean</em> something when I use or learn one power over another. Sure, those aspects can all be layered onto the game by individual groups, and in a long-term campaign with the same people, I have no doubts that eventually you will reach a shared understanding of how the world you play in actually works. But in an early game, when the lazer Cleric smites a foe with the power of his glorious lord in the first combat with goblins outside the city gate, how do NPCs react to that? Is that special, or commonplace? How do you keep the magic of that moment from becoming routine and dull when the Hand of God has smoten your foes for the 50th time?<br/><br/>At its core, I think the (excellent!) approach to focusing on balance over simulation, and letting the players decide for themselves how to deal with the situation where Come And Get It is used against oozes (and what their choice means for the nature of how the world works), has led to most players simply ceasing to try to make sense of it fictionally. The books no longer feed you descriptors, the mechanics are more abstract, there's more focus on artificially imposed 5' squares, and combined this leads to players' attention being focused on the things that don't make sense (and some that never made much sense, like Vancian magic and their 8-hour sleep cycles). Instead of layering on a really interesting creative meta-game as johnzo evidently has in order to make sense of it fictionally, they either artificially restrict PCs' action options to whatever is listed on their sheets (my friend built a mega-dungeon and said "sure, there's a world outside these gates, but you'll agree to never go there while we're playing this campaign") or simply play the game as a series of skirmishes with mostly handwaved freeform what-do-you-do-now scenes (or even cut-scenes) in between.<br/><br/>...also, no offense meant to Bill W. or Rob D. - I think the idea of all-encounter-all-the-time is pretty cool too - but am I really the only one to think that the approach of assigning hit points to everything just sounds like a slower, more tedious way of resolving Skill Challenges? If the moat has 40 HPs and the PCs do on average 10 damage when they "hit" with an Athletics skill, how is that different from saying "you need 4 successes on Athletics at DC20 to cross the moat, every time you fail you take 1d8+3 damage"? <em>Most</em> uses of powers and positioning wouldn't <em>really</em> apply, or seem necessary - and without those, DnD 4E combat is just a boring JRPG where you trade hits until one of you dies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364693/#Comment_364693" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T14:37:02+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  2:37PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2012 5:34PM by johnzo.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>I hated grid use in 4e, and i say that as someone who as an abiding love for going all out with miniatures and terrain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>I appreciate the skirmish war-game design of 4E, and if I want to engage with a game on a different level, I'd play a different game that's not a version of D&amp;D at all.

the idea of all-encounter-all-the-time is pretty cool too - but am I really the only one to think that the approach of assigning hit points to everything just sounds like a slower, more tedious way of resolving Skill Challenges? If the moat has 40 HPs and the PCs do on average 10 damage when they "hit" with an Athletics skill, how is that different from saying "you need 4 successes on Athletics at DC20 to cross the moat, every time you fail you take 1d8+3 damage"?<em>Most</em>uses of powers and positioning wouldn't<em>really</em>apply, or seem necessary - and without those, DnD 4E combat is just a boring JRPG where you trade hits until one of you dies.</blockquote>\nWell, that's the thing. I'll cop to overstating my case, but if I'm playing 4E I don't want to <i>just</i> have a skill challenge. <b>I want the skill challenge elements to be incorporated into a larger encounter,</b> so that my fights <i>don't</i> wind up being about trading hits till somebody dies. The moat-swimming in our example is just one way of getting to the Baron so I can start "hitting" him with my persuasive force, but it happens while all my buddies are running around on the map trying to figure out how to get to the Baron themselves or stop other petitioners from getting to the Baron or keep the guards from throwing us out. The map is there to keep track of all that complexity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364711/#Comment_364711" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T16:12:23+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  4:12PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2012 4:17PM by lachek.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            johnzo, I think you're misreading me, or more likely, my writing is too disorganized and impenetrable, as usual.<br/><br/>When I say "the reason I feel this way" that's not an intro to stepping up on the soap box to explain why I feel I'd rather play something other than D&amp;D, but rather to address Abel's question why I'd "criticize 4E on the grounds that the rules of 3E tie the game more firmly to the fiction, especially the combat." This is right on topic, because your rather unique technique to addressing this issue means there has to be something there to address - in this case, a degree of disconnection between mechanics and fiction (or put more charitably, an emphasis on good game design rather than simulation of a pre-defined world), by comparison to earlier editions.<br/><br/>That sentence about agreeing with Eero that 4E is an excellent wargame that I like to play, but if I wanted something that tickled my story bone more I'd probably play something else, was crucial to my line of thinking but not at all the reason for my post:<br/><br/>1) I wanted to emphasize that, despite the fact that my whole post is about why 3.x ties mechanics closer to the fiction than 4E, I still believe 4E is a superior game and it'd be my D&amp;D of choice, regardless of whatever one might believe from the rest of what I'm saying.<br/>2) (a bit more complex) I feel that your technique described in the OP is very similar to the technique used in a great deal of story games - you know, that effect where the kinda-abstract mechanics infer some sort of kinda-literal effect in the fiction, and you look down at the dice/cards/dreidel/tea-leaves and go "wow, that is <em>so bloody cool</em>... but what the hell does it <em>mean</em>??" and then you spend the next 5 minutes being super-excited about figuring out how everything fits together in the narrative, and you get this emergent story that you hadn't predicted. I think you'll agree that's essentially what we're talking about, right? You're saying, the mechanics are fixed, and known... but the world and how it works is fluid, unknown, just Points of Light at the start, and you discover it as you go by interpreting the weird outcomes of the system? And my point here with saying "if that's what I was looking for, I'd rather play something else" is coming from a place of "listen, I like wargames/peanut butter, and I like creative storytelling games/chocolate, but you got your peanut butter <em>in</em> my chocolate...". You're probably saying "hey, Reese's is awesome", and that's cool. I generally prefer it when my games have focus, when you have 4 cool creative dice interpretations in 1 session instead of 1 in 4, because that's all you do. But that was just an off-handed comment, not what the post was really about.<br/><br/>Interestingly, I think you (johnzo) and Bill are coming at this from two opposite angles: johnzo is using apparently disjointed outcomes of the system or combinations of narrative game elements to inform and lend emergent meanings to his world, expending (I'd imagine) a lot of creative brainpower to do so, while Bill is taking narrative elements from the world and mechanizing them to work more like the rest of the combat resolution system, expending (I'd imagine) a lot of mathematical and improvisational brainpower to do so. Both ideas and approaches are really interesting, but - I'd imagine! - mutually exclusive (?) if for no other reason than that computing at that level would be very expensive indeed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364724/#Comment_364724" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T17:07:07+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  5:07PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2012 5:43PM by johnzo.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>Interestingly, I think you (johnzo) and Bill are coming at this from two opposite angles: johnzo is using apparently disjointed outcomes of the system or combinations of narrative game elements to inform and lend emergent meanings to his world, expending (I'd imagine) a lot of creative brainpower to do so, while Bill is taking narrative elements from the world and mechanizing them to work more like the rest of the combat resolution system, expending (I'd imagine) a lot of mathematical and improvisational brainpower to do so.</blockquote>\nThis is golden, Mikael!  I've been mulling over my instinctive negative reaction to Bill's approach and I think you've figured it out for me.  The Bill / Rob D. approach is interesting and pervy, but it does the opposite of what I'm having fun doing.  My approach is the game informs the fiction; Bill's is that the fiction is modeled in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15995/d-d4e-the-game-informs-the-fiction-informs-the-game-informs-the-fiction" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15995/d-d4e-the-game-informs-the-fiction-informs-the-game-informs-the-fiction" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15995/d-d4e-the-game-informs-the-fiction-informs-the-game-informs-the-fiction/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F15995%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F15995%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
