At least not much. I bought the Epic 40k starter box with my brother and played maybe once. (Playing with the figures itself and destroying them to make wracks for terrain was much more fun at the time.)More recently, I bought into Warmachine, again together with my brother, and haven't played much yet either. (The one match we played was fun, though, even though I was the first to be eliminated. Caster-Kill, go figure...)<br/><br/>And still I'm fascinated. Fascinated enough that I'm scouring the internet for something I've been itching for ever since I really thought about them in any concious form: A generic tabletop game you can use with any genre, with any figures.<br/><br/>I think on some level, this is like the search for the "perfect system": Futile and wierd. On the other hand, looking for "better systems" has led me to system that are actually better for what I want. Even just Wushu hits so many of my buttons, it's scary. (In a very satisfying way...) On another level, this search is driven both by my dislike of being bound to one publisher and my annoyance at many of the "mainstream" tabletop games I investigated. There are many ... "golden cows" that don't seem to have much use but can totally go on my nerves. (Like "No pre-measuring"...)<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm rambling. (Sorry.) The thing I actually want to talk about is my ULTIMATE FAVORITE Tabletop system right now: <b>Mechaton</b>.<br/><br/>When I read the first version of Mechaton, I went "Cool design, cool idea, there could be a good game in this". And then Vincent actually went and made that game. Awesome. So I bought it and it has totally stoked my fascination with tabletop again. (And Lego. Really must get my lego washed and ready again. Cats+Tons of Lego=Bad)<br/><br/>But while I'm thinking about playing a game of Mechaton, there's this tiny voice in my head wondering "Could I use Mechaton for other stuff? Could I make Mechaton into the universal game I've been looking for?"<br/><br/>So, that's what this (terribly winded, rambling) post is actually about: Poking Mechaton in strange places to make it do things Vincent probably didn't intend but which might be fun. Hopefully. To me, anyway...<br/><br/><b>Stuff that totally works for what I want:</b><br/><br/>I love how building Mechas (system-wise) works. The balance between various ranges and attachments, wether to go for heavy and hard-hitting or fast and agile, One-Shot Rockets, and so on. Totally works in its simplicity and is pretty much completly what I want. While I have this itch to overcomplicate things, I think this could cover virtually any type of unit I could thing of in a tabletop game. At worst it would be easy to houserule additional details, like different Mech/Unit sizes or new attachment types into the game, as things are abstract enough. (<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I even saw rules for exactly those things today while searching for Mechaton threads somewhere here, on the Forge or on RPGnet, but I can't find them now. Wierd.</span> Ah, <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showpost.php?p=7769234&amp;postcount=17" rel="nofollow">found them</a>! ^_^)<br/><br/>The general system, rolling and assigning dice, cover and basically the whole shebang.  Again, Abstract enough to cover virtually anything and still make for good gaming.<br/><br/><b>Stuff that might not work so well for what I want:</b> <br/><br/>The "points/winning condition/doomsday clock/attacker-defender-thingy rules complex". Sounds stupid but I couldn't find a better way to describe it. The way I see it, this works great for Mechaton as a game, it makes things fast, it sets up the battles and makes for interesting tacticical battles. But I'm not sure if it works for what I want. Maybe this is just the "But I want to simulate stuff" guy inside me making things more complicated then they really are, dunno. But could Mechaton-as-an-engine also work without the strict attacker/defender split? Or without the doomsday clock? Would it work for a deathmatch-style last-man-standing-wins fight without points? Would it work for a fight where there's just one location to attack, with the defenders in the trenches and attackers trying to rush them? For an ambush on a suply train that's got to reach the edge of the playing field in X rounds?<br/><br/>I don't know and here is where my lack of Actual Play really shows. Maybe trying to shoehorn Mechaton into something completly different would break the game in painfull and unfun ways. On the other hand, I can't be the only one thinking about this, can I? Has anybody else here thought about using the Mechaton rules in ways Man Wasn't Meant To Play?<br/><br/>M                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93567/#Comment_93567" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T16:13:35+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  4:13PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Only slightly off-topic: What happend with the Plan to writing Campaign Rules for Mechaton?

What makes it so special?</blockquote>Well, I can tell you what I like about it:<br/><br/>When designing Mechs, you give them "Attachments", which give you dice. So for example a gun attachment might give you a red die for attacking at [some Range]. A booster attachment gives you a green die for movement and so on. Depending on how many and what attachments you give your mecha, you can get other dice for balance, so for example, if you take less then the maximum number of attachments (four), you get additional Initiative dice, which nicely modells a smaller (ie. with less weapons/gear/armor), more fragile (Because attachments also sorta serve as "hitpoints") and also faster mecha. Or if you don't take any Ranged attachments, you get an additional green d8 (normally you only get d6) for movement, so you can potentially be faster then anybody else.<br/>So already the way you build your units is pretty nifty and covers a lot of ground. (There are also a number of options I didn't describe, like One Shot missiles or multiple weapons at the same range, ...)<br/><br/>The next cool thing is how you actually use those dice. When it's your turn, you roll all those dice your mecha gets you, plus two white dice all mechas get, and then assign them to Attack, Defense and Movement. (Leaving additional things like Spotting out for now.) Colored dice can only be assigned to their appropriate actions (So red for attack, green for movement, ...), but white dice can be assigned to any action, so there's choice mixed in with the randomness of the roll, too. (Like, do you go for the low dice in defense, reserving the high one for attack? Or maybe leave the attack out and instead concentrate on movement to get into Cover? ...)<br/><br/>All in all, it's a pretty tight design, pretty rules-light (Which I like) and flexible (Which I like too) and enough abstraction to over much ground while still providing a solid framework. (As an example, it doesn't matter what sort of Defense attachment you have, wether it's shields or Armor or whatever. It gives you those blue dice all the same. Or how One Shot Rockets could also describe grenades or maybe even airstrikes. Well, the last one was a spontaneous idea and I don't really know if it's rules-kosher. Still. it wouldn't be hard to houserule in.)<br/><br/>That the whole thing works with Lego is a bonus to me, but I think it would work just as well with other miniatures. (Though you couldn't splatter the table with destroyed attachments and shattered mechs...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93591/#Comment_93591" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T19:08:04+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  7:08PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 6, 2007 7:17PM by komradebob.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the Hippy Part of this design may be going over my head.<br/><br/>Either that or I'm used to even "hippier" wargame designs.<br/><br/>What does one do in this game that makes it so different?

Sorry!  I was just joking!<br/><br/>I own Mechaton.  I've played it.  I like it a lot.  I actually went out and bought dice of the proper color to make sure that I could play it.  I think that it's a clever design, particularly the "points/winning condition/doomsday clock/attacker-defender-thingy rules complex".  And I'm not saying that because Vincent Baker designed it.  I'm saying it because it is true.<br/><br/>And I consider myself to be a hippy storygamer.  Indie gamers didn't run over my dog.  <br/><br/>I just laugh about Mechaton for the same reason that I laugh about Jungle Speed (another game which I enjoy greatly).  For some reason, these games have caught on in the indie game scene, even though they don't really seem to connect with anything inherent in indie gaming.  It's like my relationship with Heroscape.

Rather. Mechaton is cool because it does a fairly good job of abstracting real-world combat issues.  I remember reading about Vincent's design process <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/results.php?term=mechaton&amp;in=Posts" rel="nofollow">on his blog</a>, where there were various people (Sydney Freeburg and Ralph Mazza spring to mind) bringing up actual combat issues.  So, for example the spotting rules reflect some of this discussion, as do the initial setup rules, where one attacker is placed so as to have been "sighted" by the defender.  The rules are simple, but they are not dumbed down.<br/><br/>There's also the Lego aspect of the game.  Like most minis games, there's a "toy" factor involved.  But, unlike most minis games, where the visual appeal is the result of painting and whatnot, Mechaton's visual appeal is the result of your skill (or lack thereof) at Lego modeling.  I am not a good Lego modeler, by the way.<br/><br/>Also, I think that the unit activation system is nifty.  Essentially, if you shoot at an enemy mech that hasn't gone yet, it takes its turn immediately.  So, sometimes you might not want to shoot at a certain unit, simply because you don't want it to get its turn yet.<br/><br/>Finally, the victory points system balances out armies without appealing to point costs.  Essentially, each mech or "station" (aka Take and Hold Point) is worth a certain number of VPs to each player.  If you have more mechs or more attachments on your mechs, you gain fewer VPs from capturing stations and get the disadvantaged setup at the beginning of the game.  So, there can be an advantage to taking a smaller army, because you are automatically granted a handicap.<br/><br/>If you have any interest in minis games with quick setup and clever rules, then you should pick it up.

And I had assumed that I would change the rules, basically because my son has these sets of legos for ships, and I wanted to make the rules work with those. Plus some ideas about things like "Hull" and such that I wanted to put in. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hadn't considered for a moment using the system pretty much as written (just creating spaceships, rather than mechs). But I think I should give it a try. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for parochialism... yes and no. Mechaton is, in fact, sorta "indie" in that it's not like most miniatures rules, where they assume that you will want to dedicate a day to playing the game with as many miniatures as you have and can reasonably fit on a table. Like I frequently do with Warhammer 40K. It appeals to us, I think, because it challenges the idea that a miniatures game has to be this huge investment of time and effort, and needs to have endlist lists of equipment and such. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not the first system to do this, BTW. The urge to go in such directions often rears it's head in minis. Take, for example, the recently popular game "Hordes of the Things" (AKA HOTT). Which uses a generic system to enable people to use whatever miniatures they have on hand, and has one system to cover them all. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne difference here, however, is that HOTT isn't really all that well designed (produces fascinating tactics with the flying creatures and their travel patterns, for instance). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in addition to Mechaton being indie-ish, it's also better than a lot of the systems one can find out there. So, while some may be playing it because it's all they've encountered, I play it because it's really one of the better systems that I've come across. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo say nothing of the fact that it uses Legos, and does it better than any other Lego system that I've seen. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo it's really a combination of things. Mechaton isn't really spectacularly better than other miniatures games out there, but it's functional, fun, locally available, fast to play, and about legos. Until something else comes along that presents itself as well, I'm not surprised that it'll be popular around these parts. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe real test is whether, since it's not all that "dirty hippie," whether or not it'll get any traction in the larger game market. And I think it's got a good shot. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93648/#Comment_93648" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T07:07:50+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  7:07AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lord Minx</cite>So, with everything shiney happy again, I'm still wondering about a "universalised" Mechaton.

That said, here goes....\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lord Minx</cite>But could Mechaton-as-an-engine also work without the strict attacker/defender split? Or without the doomsday clock? Would it work for a deathmatch-style last-man-standing-wins fight without points? Would it work for a fight where there's just one location to attack, with the defenders in the trenches and attackers trying to rush them? For an ambush on a suply train that's got to reach the edge of the playing field in X rounds?</blockquote>\nIn the rules, there's already a scenario where each player gets one mech and you're fighting over one station.  IIRC, whoever owns the station at game end wins.  So, that answers most of your questions there.  As for a supply train, I don't see why not.<br/><br/>Here's the thing that I'm thinking.  Essentially, a "unit" in Mechaton is really just a handful of dice.  You can represent that on the board however you want.  So, perhaps, instead of a mech, it's a tank squadron.  Each time you lose an "attachment", you lose a tank model.  Eventually, you run out of tanks.  IIRC, this is how Epic 40K worked.  (I played Epic 2nd, but I got involved in the Net Epic project instead of converting to Epic 40K rules, so I'm a little vague on how the newer rules worked.)<br/><br/>My big concern would be that Mechaton doesn't support a large number of units well.  Each unit requires 6-8 dice of different colors.  And, since you can lose dice due to battle damage, you need to track those dice pools separately.  Without applying some sort of group abstraction (like I outlined above), a large battle could be a painful exercise in dice logistics.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93655/#Comment_93655" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T07:30:56+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  7:30AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Well, but then why Mechaton instead of one of the bazillions of free, customizable/universal minis systems out there in cyberspace?</blockquote>Let me put it this way: Why are you playing [Random game you Like] instead of the bazillions of free, customizable/universal roleplaying games out there in the cyberspace? Probably because you know about it, own it and like it. Same with me and Mechaton.<br/><br/>Might there be a game out there in the interweb that does what I want even better the Mechaton: Maybe. But if so, I haven't found it yet. I'm looking, if time and motivation permit it, but until i find it, I'll have fun with what I have.\n<blockquote><br/>OTOH, no one seems to be able to tell me what this game does that makes it stick out ffrom the crowd or why it is better at a broader application than other games.</blockquote>Bob, don't get me wrong, but I think you're making two mistakes here:<br/><br/>Mistake 1 is to assume that Mechaton is some kind of Miracle game that reinvents the genre and is better then toasted bread and hookers put together, when I don't think anybody here is actually saying that. It's a nice game by a nice designer, which makes it much more likely that people here know about it, own it and like it. Nothing more, nothing less.<br/>Mistake 2 is, and please correct me if I'm wrong here, to look at other people, ask them what is cool about this game, but not be satisfied with their answers, probably because of Mistake 1. Asking people why they like [Game X] isn't bad or futile per se, but at some point, it all boils down to "Because I know it, own it and, irrationally, like it". Often not very satisfying, I know (Been there myself), but probably the only "real" answer one is going to get, ultimately.<br/><br/>So, well, I gave you snippes of what i liked about it in my posts above. I could go on about other snippets I like, but ultimately that not what I started this thread for and so I'd prefer it if you's start a new thread about the question why people here like Mechaton.

It doesn't simulate much, at least not in the very concrete way most wargames try to do. So, for example, ranges attachments don't have varous stats, they don't crit, they don't really have varying ranges (At least not beyond the three ranges at attack attachments fit in.) and they don't really have varying damage. Ultimately, they just help you damage other mechs by increasing your chance for a high roll.<br/><br/>This abstraction and "vagueness" makes it easy to use for other stuff and still get apropriate results. Just today I was browsing the Warmachine site, looking at the pictures and mentally assigning the units dice, like "Yeah, Khador cavalry totally has one or two green dice, with two red dice split for hand-to-hand and direct fire and maybe a blue dice for heavy armor." and so on. So, yeah, I think it would work, resolution-wise, but I'm really thinking about the other parts of the system, like the scoring system and the doomsday clock. I'm less sure about these...\n<blockquote>As for parochialism... <br/>[Snip]<br/></blockquote>Mike, this is extremly interesting for me, but I'd really wish we could split the thread, leaving this one for "Using Mechaton for other stuff", wether your spaceships or my universal wargame, and making a new one for "What's cool about Mechaton" or "Taking Indie Techniques to Wargames" or something like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93658/#Comment_93658" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T07:43:15+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  7:43AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Great Wolf</cite><br/>Here's the thing that I'm thinking.

On your mech's turn, you roll all your dice at once and up front: red for attack, green for movement, blue for defense, yellow for surveillance/communication, and white for wild. From your roll you choose one die to be your defense number (a blue or a white), one to be your movement (a green or a white), one to be your attack (a red or a white) and one to be your spotting (a yellow or a white).<br/><br/>The white dice mean that you get to constantly prioritize and reprioritize. Say you roll a red 4, a blue 1, and a white 6. If you use the white 6 for defense, then that leaves you with a 4 for your attack, which is okay but pretty weak. But if you use the white 6 for your attack, that leaves you with a super crappy defense number.<br/><br/>Every turn, you get to weigh your mech's immediate objective against the realities of your roll and make real choices about how to follow through.<br/><br/>That's what I think's cool about the game.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93676/#Comment_93676" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T09:00:49+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  9:00AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vincent, while you're here: What do you think about Mechaton being used for other games?

(Or too long, anyway.) On the other hand, would it break the game if it was removed, assuming there's something else in place to keep the game from going indefenitly? (A fixed time limit, a specific victory condition, ...)<br/><br/>-The Point Per system: This is really an ingenious little bit of design that gives players fielding less powerfull armies a good advantage and makes for balanced play. But have you every had the chance to experiment with different setups, perhaps during your campaign playtests? (And what happened to those anyway? Any plans to publish eventually?)

At the start of the game, the Doomsday Clock (a d12 or d20) is set to eleven. Then, at the end of every turn, it gets ticked one down, with every player (in descending order of the current score) having the option to tick it down another point. When it's at zero, the game is over and the player with the highest score wins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I think Sydney pointed it out). Unless I'm spectacularly unlucky \xe2\u20ac\u201d and, sure that happens \xe2\u20ac\u201d you're just going to crumble. At first, the matchup is 1:1, 1:1, 2:1.

What makes it so special?</blockquote>\nIt's the only wargame that hippy storygamers will touch.  [i]Dirtside II[/i], [i]Full Thrust[/i], even [i]Warhammer 40K[/i]...these are too crunchy and beneath a true hippy gamer.<br/><br/>But [i]Mechaton[/i]...well, hippy storygamers can play [i]that[/i] because Vincent Baker designed it.<br/><br/>Can't tell if that's tongue-in-cheek, but, yeah, it's a wargame for non-wargamers. It has nothing to do with who designed it (that is, i was interested long before i found out who wrote it, and, given my very mixed opinion of DitV, i wouldn't've bought it on the designer's name alone, anyway). Though, in all honesty, i can't tell you how much of it is the mechanics, and how much is that i get to play with Legos. I'll put up with an awful lot if it involves Legos. <br/><br/>For me, at least, what's so special about the game is that it uses Legos, and it's not terribly fiddly. That is, it's pretty abstracted, at least compared to most wargames i've looked at. There are only 6 sorts of attachments, and mechs have at most 4 attachments, with fairly limited options for duplicate/redundant attachments. So, mechanically speaking, there's a fairly limited pallette of possible mechs. But, since it's Lego, you can have near-infinite variation in the fluff (and the appearance), it just doesn't complex-up the crunch. For some, that would be a bug. For me and mine, it's a feature. It means i can have  mechs with a high-intensity laser, an X-47 rifled railgun, and a semi-automatic rapid-fire tungsten-carbide self-reloading howitzer with satellite-assisted targetting--and each one's just an artillery-range weapon attachment. Plus, it uses Legos.<br/><br/>Likewise, the interactions of the various dice (attack, defense, spotting, etc.) and the few other rules (cover, line-of-sight, movement, etc.) are for the most part straightforward and simple, and the strategic options, mechanically speaking, are fairly limited, once you've got your mechs built. Most of what there is in terms of strategy comes in in building your mechs in the first place. So those of us whose teeth itch at the mere mention of 'wargame' aren't frustrated by Mechaton. It actually reminds me of Settlers of Catan more than most wargames--a similar level of complexity, and, similarly, neither skill/experience nor initial conditions seem to dominate the game. The more-experienced player will tend to do better, but not drastically so. So the less-experienced players still have fun. But there is a point to careful mech construction and strategic play, so the more experienced players don't feel like there's no point to playing well.<br/><br/>Don't really no what the "hippy gamers" thing has to do with it. I don't think "hippyness" can be much of a measure of crunchiness, seeing as how most of the Forge-inspired games are all mechanics, with everything of import (by intention) tied to the mechanics.<br/><br/>And, did i mention that Mechaton uses Legos?<br/><br/>Seriously, if you hate Legos, <i>and</i> enjoy crunchy [war]games, Mechaton is probably not for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96354/#Comment_96354" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T13:31:29+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  1:31PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2007 2:17PM by komradebob.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm neutral to negative about Lego and like very lite with high color/player input in my minis games.<br/><br/>Perhaps I've approached this the wrong way.<br/><br/>Could someone who does in fact <b>like<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></b><i></i> minis wargames and knows their way around a fair number of them tell me what (aside from the Doomsday Clock and the dice with variable uses, which are very interesting) what is cool about this game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96802/#Comment_96802" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T03:51:46+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  3:51AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Could someone who does in fact<b>like<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i></i></span>minis wargames and knows their way around a fair number of them tell me what (aside from the Doomsday Clock and the dice with variable uses, which are very interesting) what is cool about this game?</blockquote>Could you, maybe, please, ask that question in another thread?
