I used it for a Charlie Chaplin style romp once. Complete with descriptions of black powder in the face when something explodes.  The only thing "realistic" about traditional slapstick comedies is that they are not animated.

You might ask why.  Here's a thing off the top of my head:  hit points.  Hit points are not funny.<br/><br/>After a few playtests of SAN!, one of my players remarked that, yeah, it was funny, but you could do funny with <i>any</i> game.  I disagreed.  I told him, "Calculating your THAC0 is not funny."<br/><br/>There are specialized pockets of funny, and you need specialized games to hit them.  There is a particular one that SAN! hits squarely.  It's not the Three Stooges/Keystone Kops/Buster Keaton kind of funny, though.<br/><br/><i>However</i>, the <b>principles</b> of SAN! are pretty flexible, and can be applied to other kinds of funny.  I wrote another game called <i>OBLITERATI</i> that's more of a comedy of manners, using <i>essentially</i> the same techniques, but with different aims (I also stripped down the rules quite a bit).  I posted about it awhile back, and the rules are on my LJ <a href="http://americanwizard.livejournal.com/10441.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

Mooks (faceless npcs) are handle abstractly as a Threat rating that has to be reduced - which also allows complete freedom in describing how that happens. It would translate exactly to Slapstick. Here's the explanation from the rulebook:\n<blockquote>Every player gets one die in their pool just for doing something. To get more dice, they have to add details to their description of the action. These "Embellishments" can be anything from additional actions to technical details or dramatic flourishes. As long as they're entertaining, and appropriate to the desired tone of the game, they're worth an extra die.<br/>For example...<br/>A player who shoots someone gets only their default (1) die. A player who<br/>shoots someone (1) while jumping down a flight of stairs (+1) and landing in a<br/>summersault (+1) gets 3 dice. A player who shoots someone (1), then ducks<br/>under a punch (+1) and leg sweeps the guy (+1) so he can shoot the goon<br/>behind him (+1) and then knocks out the first guy with a boot to the face<br/>(+1) gets 5 dice.<br/>A player who kicks someone gets only their default (1) die. A player who<br/>kicks someone (1) in the throat (+1), making their trachea collapse with an<br/>audible "sssssnap" (+1) gets 3 dice. A player who kicks someone (1) so hard<br/>that they crash through a window (+1) and fall screaming to the street<br/>seven floors below (+1), crushing the roof of a taxi (+1) and causing onlookers<br/>to run screaming in all directions (+1) gets 5 dice.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_167553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167553/#Comment_167553" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-07T13:35:50+00:00" title="September  7, 2008  1:35PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2008 1:36PM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wushu sounds like a well conceived game, John.

Anyone got a name for it?<br/><br/><b>WHAT YOU NEED</b><br/>3-5 people;<br/>Pens &amp; paper;<br/>A big bowl of dice, in two colors.  It doesn\u2019t matter how many sides; it\u2019s an even/odd mechanic, so as long as they\u2019re not those fabled d7s or something, you can use any combination of sizes.  It also doesn\u2019t matter which two colors, but I\u2019ll be referring to them as white and black.<br/><br/><b>GETTING READY</b><br/>You need to decide who will be in charge of antagonism &amp; adversity.  This can be one person, or you can share the responsibility, whichever you feel most comfortable with.  This person is hereafter referred to as the Antagonism Player, or AP.<br/><br/>Now it\u2019s time to make your PCs.  If the AP is just one person, he doesn\u2019t make a PC, but he can make an Antagonist Character (AC), which works the same way.  Give your PC a name, and write it down on a sheet of paper.  Then come up with some traits that describe the PC, in terms of appearance, personality, ability, whatever, and write these down on the sheet.  Create your characters out loud; that is, as you write down \u201cBaggy trousers\u201d as a trait, say out loud, \u201cMy guy wears baggy trousers.\u201d  Just come up with enough traits for everyone to get a good picture of your character; you can add more whenever you want.*<br/><br/>Now you need to decide the situation.  The PCs need to be working toward some sort of identifiable objective that is accomplished through smaller, accumulated tasks.  Building a house, courting lovers, selling vacuum cleaners door-to-door, etc.  If you can\u2019t decide on one, just put a bunch of ideas into a hat and draw one at random.  The AC, if there is one, needs to be working against them in some way.  ACs are usually authority figures (the boss, a stern mother-in-law, a cop, etc.), and they should be played as though they have a personal grudge against the PCs.<br/><br/><b>LAUGHTER</b><br/>During the game (including chargen!), anytime your contributions cause someone to laugh, claim a white die from the bowl.  If they laugh so hard that they fall out of their chair, do a spit-take, or spew fluids from their nose, take five white dice.  White dice are good, so you want to be at the top of your funny.  In-character quips, sound effects, miming, and facial expressions will be good ways to do this.<br/><br/><b>SCENE FRAMING</b><br/>Next you have to frame your first scene.  Everyone participates in this, contributing an element at a time to the scene, until everyone feels like you\u2019ve got enough.  Again, you can add stuff later when you want,* so don\u2019t sweat it; just get a good picture of it.<br/><br/>Later on, you can call for a new scene when it\u2019s appropriate (like if you need to change locales).<br/><br/><b>TASKS, PROGRESS, AND FRUSTRATION</b><br/>Once the scene is in place, players controlling PCs will take turns around the table.  On your turn, you can either attempt a Task, try to overcome a Setback, help someone else overcome a Setback, or vent your Frustrations.  I\u2019ll explain those other ones in a minute; here\u2019s how Tasks work.<br/><br/>Describe how your PC performs some small task that contributes to overall progress towards the objective.  The AP then describes how something goes wrong.  Then it\u2019s time to roll dice.<br/><br/>For each of your traits that is involved in any way with your description of the Task, you may take one white die from the bowl; hold these dice in your hand.  If you do this, put a check mark next to that trait on your sheet; you won\u2019t be able to get a die from it again this scene.  If another PC has traits that are involved, that PC\u2019s player may let you use them for dice as well (these traits are still checked off).  If this is the first time the Task in question has been attempted in the way you described, take one white die from the bowl, and add it to the dice in your hand.  If you feel like you need more dice, you can take some of the dice you\u2019ve earned by making people laugh.<br/><br/>The AP gets one white die if this is the first time the misfortune/accident/whatever he described has happened.  If his AC is involved, he may get dice from the AC\u2019s traits just like PC traits.  He may also use dice he\u2019s earned from making people laugh.  Finally, he gets all the black dice that you currently have (if you\u2019ve just started, you don\u2019t have any yet).<br/><br/>Now that you\u2019ve both got your dice, roll \u2018em.  You\u2019re looking for even-numbered results.  If you\u2019ve got more evens than the AP, you win; you make some progress despite the misfortune, and gain a Progress point (make a hashmark on the bottom of your sheet somewhere).  If the AP wins, then you fail to make any Progress, and, if he can think of one, he may inflict a Setback on you or one of the other PCs as a consequence of what just happened.  Also, if the AP wins, your PC gains some Frustration:  take a black die from the bowl.  <br/><br/>If you tie, then the thing that went wrong doesn\u2019t cause any Setbacks or prevent Progress, yet.  Instead, it triggers a chain event, which the AP describes, and you describe your PC\u2019s reaction to it, and then you roll dice again.  If it ties again, then there\u2019s another chain event, and so on, until you either win or lose.<br/><br/>All white dice that were rolled are now returned to the bowl.  Black dice are returned to the player.  I\u2019ll tell you how to get rid of them in a minute.<br/><br/>Once that\u2019s done, your turn is over.  In fact, any time you roll dice, that\u2019s the end of your turn.<br/><br/>(continued)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167723/#Comment_167723" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T09:54:21+00:00" title="September  8, 2008  9:54AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>EXAMPLE<br/>The PCs are building a house.  It\u2019s Ted\u2019s turn.  Ted\u2019s player says that Ted is nailing a doorframe together.  The AP says that, as Ted reaches back to swing the hammer, the hammerhead flies off and hits PC William in the head.  If this is the first time that someone has attempted to drive nails with a hammer, Ted\u2019s player gets a die for that (and, the next time someone drives nails or tries to assemble a doorframe, they have to think of another way to do it, or else receive no die).  If this is the first time that a hammerhead has flown off, the AP gets a die for that.<br/><br/>Ted\u2019s player aslo gets a die from, say, Ted\u2019s \u201cBig and strong\u201d trait, and he checks it off on the sheet.  Let\u2019s say that Ted also has a \u201cWhistle while you work\u201d trait, and he\u2019s whistling while he works, so Ted\u2019s player can get a die for that, then check it off.  Ted\u2019s player and the AP take some dice from their earned-from-laughter pile.  Ted has not been Frustrated yet, so he has no black dice.  <br/><br/>They roll.  Let\u2019s say the AP wins.  Ted\u2019s player takes a black die from the bowl.  The AP says that the hammerhead knocks William unconscious as a Setback.  The AP should feel free to add sound effects, and the involved players should feel free to roleplay responses.  That\u2019s how you\u2019re going to get your extra dice, after all.<br/><br/>If Ted had won, there would have been no Setback or Frustration, and he would have made Progress somehow.  Maybe William ducks at just the right moment, the hammerhead ricochets off a conveniently placed tree, and lands back on the hammer\u2019s shaft just in time for Ted to drive the nail.  Why not?  It could happen.<br/><br/>If the rolls had tied, then maybe William gets hit with the hammerhead and stumbles over to knock the can of nails into the air, and the nails are now falling through the air (pointy end downward, of course)  toward Ted, who, let\u2019s say, shrieks and tries to take cover under the doorframe.  This is the first time that nails have fallen through the air, so the AP gets a die for that, plus the same black dice.  This is the first time that someone has taken cover under a doorframe, so Ted gets a white die, plus, let\u2019s say, one for a \u201cHigh-pitched shriek\u201d trait.<br/><br/>If Ted loses this roll, then he probably ends up with a bunch of nails sticking out him (Setback).  If he wins, then the nails probably land in the doorframe in neat rows, nailing it together (Progress).</i><br/><br/><br/><b>SETBACKS</b><br/>Anytime a character suffers some consequence that would prevent him from attempting Tasks, that\u2019s a Setback.  Being buried by a pile of rubble, getting your jacket caught in the door, being glued to the ceiling, etc.  You deal with Setbacks just like you deal with Tasks:  say how you\u2019re doing it, the AP says what goes wrong, you claim and roll dice.  The only difference is that you don\u2019t get Progress points for success; the reward for winning is overcoming the Setback.  If the AP wins, he can inflict a Setback on someone else, or he can change the one that currently affects you.  F\u2019rinstance, if you were hanging from a balcony by your beltloops, maybe you fall, break through some floorboards, and are now lodged there, with your legs sticking up out of the floor.<br/><br/>If you have suffered a Setback, you can\u2019t do anything on your turn except try to overcome it.  If your buddy suffers a Setback, then you probably want to use your turn to try to get him out of it.  Because, let\u2019s face it, you\u2019re going to need all the help you can get if there\u2019s going to be any Progress.<br/><br/>If you can\u2019t think of a way to deal with a Setback, you can scratch off a Progress point and cut to a later time (but same scene), and you\u2019ve overcome the Setback in the interval.  Don\u2019t worry about how, it doesn\u2019t really matter.<br/><br/><b>WHY, I OUGHTTA\u2026</b><br/>The only way to get rid of Frustration (black dice) is to take it out on other people.  Describe how you\u2019re going to take it out on one of the other PCs.  If this would not have any lasting consequences (i.e. wouldn\u2019t cause a Setback), then return one black die to the bowl.  If it would cause a Setback, then return three black dice to the bowl; then, if that PC\u2019s player wishes, he can describe something going wrong or his PC resisting or retaliating, and then you both roll dice as normal.  The loser suffers the Setback, which is defined by the winner.  <br/><br/><b>THE ENDING</b><br/>The game comes to an end when a PC hits 10 Frustration or Progress Points.  When this happens, total up everyone\u2019s Frustration and Progress.  If total Progress meets or exceeds total Frustration, then the PCs attain their objective.  Otherwise, they don\u2019t.<br/><br/>*FOOTNOTE<br/>I say \u201cwhenever you want,\u201d but, not really, because your fellow players need to be okay with it.  In other words, don\u2019t be a jackass about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167735/#Comment_167735" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T10:40:25+00:00" title="September  8, 2008 10:40AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My InSpectres play contains the most reliable slaptstick comedy.

Look at how I stressed the fact that the second action is something _the player_ want, not _the character_<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>This is character used as an exaple in the rulebook:<br/><br/>Spike (an Elf)<br/>Stage: genital (it could be Oral or Anal, instead)<br/>Demeanor: wise-ass<br/><br/>Char: <br/>Spunk: 1<br/>Dumb Luck: 4<br/>Low Cunning: 4<br/><br/>If Spike want to stun an orc guard, with a frontal attack. he has to roll at least an 1 with 3d10<br/><br/>If he use "an action that, in GM's judgment, is notably childish, rude and/or sneaky", he can add Low Cunning to the number he has to roll. So he stun the orc guard rolling at least a five or less with 3d10. This bonus is negated in two cases: "(1) if the tactic is a repeat, especially during the same session, and (2) if the announced tactic is clearly not funny to anyone else in the group"<br/><br/>If, instead, the player want to use Spike's dumb luck, she declares that Spike want to befriend the orc guard, without doing him any harm. But she (THE PLAYER) want instead that Spike hit the guard by mistake and stun him. The player rolls the 3d10, and if she get at least a die with a number equal or lower than 5 (4+1), ONLY THE PLAYER-DESIRED ACTION SUCCEED. So the character fail, but the player succeed.<br/>(if the roll is a complete success, with all three dice with results equal or lower than 5, the character action succeed, too)<br/><br/>There are other rules that add to the slapstick (the magic rules, for example, with spells that fails a lot of the times with various "special effects", or the rules that encourage stealing objects from each other) but this should give a good enough idea of the style of the game (the game is a D&amp;D  satire).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167771/#Comment_167771" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T13:19:23+00:00" title="September  8, 2008  1:19PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Same effect.

(I know you're not <i>attacking</i> it, but you know what I mean)<br/><br/>The title is supposed to be utterly ridiculous and nonsensical at one level, but on another level it's poetic and evocative.  I'm a fan of Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band, who have songs with titles like "Neon Meate Dream of a Octafish" [sic] and "Bat Chain Puller."  A lot of people term this sort of thing "word salad," and look down on it.  However, let's look at, say, Japanese.  Did you know that if you translate "Caution! Mercury" into Japanese and back into English, it's "Silver water rough adventure"?  That makes sense in Japanese, but not in English, until you look at it a certain way.  And when you look at it that certain way, it's poetic and evocative.<br/><br/>I'm inclined to think that anything that forces you to look at things in a manner you're not accustomed to is a good thing.<br/><br/>The style of humor that SAN! is made for is one such thing.  It's made to capture a particular brand of humor that I first encountered in an improv troupe I used to be a member of.  It's a kind of humor that requires you take a broad, general view of things, and let your brain draw connections and relationships between things that, to "rational" approaches, are clearly unrelated.  (On a related note, see "the Psychic Game," created by two of my friends from that improv troupe, which I've posted <a href="http://americanwizard.livejournal.com/11584.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>)<br/><br/>In one session, I played Jimbo the Barbarian, while my friends played a used car salesman and a sullen goth girl.  We started in the city.  What's Jimbo the Barbarian doing in the city?  Who knows.  But he interpreted everything according to what he was used to.  So, the gorilla playing three-card monte on the sidewalk?  <i>Clearly</i> a savage man-ape sent after me by my nemesis, the Skull-Faced Man (I didn't even know who the Skull-Faced Man was; it just came out).  That sullen goth girl? <i>Clearly</i> a priestess of dark gods, not to be trusted at all.  The sewer? <i>Clearly</i> one of the Skull-Faced Man's dungeons.  One of the great things about that session was that the sewer <i>did</i> turn out to be one of the Skull-Faced Man's dungeons, as well as a sewer.  And the sullen goth girl turned out to be capable of summoning the spirits of the dead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168099/#Comment_168099" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T18:48:53+00:00" title="September  9, 2008  6:48PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marshall Burns</cite>Hit points are not funny.</blockquote>\nHit points are hilarious.

Saying that you have "a system with hit points" in any system where you have a ablative resource that take you out of the game once finished is rather silly, it would mean that every single game has HP, even Amber (you have an ablative resource called "the life of my character", you get one of them, once you lost that you are out).  It's a way of thinking that I see as a leftover of the "old great wars against D&amp;D" of the '80, when gamers everywhere fought in an eternal war about the HP of D&amp;D, with one side having a stake in pointing out that "wound levels" or similar techniques were ablative resources like hit points. And as always in this "war" between "it's exactly like hit points" and "it's completely different from hit points" the middle was excluded "it's a technique similar to hit points but with interesting differences"<br/><br/>If there is a thing we should have learned, in all this time, it's that a game technique is NOT only its mathematical model. Using tokens is different than counting with your fingers that is different from losing dice that is different from paying money that it's different from changing the number of hit points you have written on your character sheet. They are different, feel different, have different effects on a game. <br/><br/>Or are you saying that rolling 3d10 is exactly the same thing, in a game, than calling 100 people by phone at random, seeing how much time you can keep them on line before they hang up, see the second digit of the seconds (1-10) for every one, ask to another person in the street for 3 numbers between 1-100, adding the digit you got from the three persons you called that correspond to the three numbers, because you get the exact mathematical effect?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168337/#Comment_168337" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T12:56:26+00:00" title="September 10, 2008 12:56PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (All I said was, "The system can have "hit points" with or without the techniques..."

Some of the Reversals (capitalized by habit--it's a stat from my old 3SRPG) might have unintended results for the original attacker (hits self on head or whatever), but there's still intent to hit (and the Reverser intends to Reverse). Sure, not all slapstick contains intent--a ton of it IS unintentional consequences. but not "always," from the character's POV.<br/><br/>I also wonder about the horror bit. Horrific for the hapless victim, maybe? I guess it's potentially horrific for the audience, watching the facade of a building almost flatten Buster Keyton (recall this was WAY before screen tricks--every gag was, in effect, a stunt). Or someone getting poked in the eye with a fork--EWWW! But "grounded in horror"? Is this a reworking of the common theory that all comedy is tragedy that happens to someone else (i.e. someone with whom we haven't established an empathic relationship, in the fiction)? If so, then I'd have to counter that tragedy &lt;&gt; horror, though some tragedy has horrific precursors or antecedents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168502/#Comment_168502" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T10:49:14+00:00" title="September 11, 2008 10:49AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Poking someone in the eye without the unintended (from one standpoint or the other) reversal isn't funny - it's horrifying. (The results may be tragic as well in terms of the character's being-in-the-world, but that's the stuff of Shakespeare.)<br/><br/>Slapstick works by forcing us to see the action simultaneously as being potentially horrifying, yet knowing that something is going to happen to reverse it before we get there.<br/><br/>The interesting thing is that today's ultra-violent Horror films (and video games) are Slapstick "without the joke" - at least the conscious joke. Audiences often still laugh at the horrifying things they see on screen - mainly because they can keep their duality of vision: simultaneously seeing the horrible fate befalling a character, yet always being reminded that it's a construction for their entertainment. And one way that is done is by keeping the Reversal, which is still there either in the form of the superhuman foe who returns from certain destruction with no logical explanation - or the equally relentless unending string of misfortunes (whether human directed or Final Destination style). All in all being a lot more than the term "Torture Porn" would imply.<br/><br/>I think that for today's audiences (except for the very youngest) a Horror game that works at that level of exaggeration would be much more popular than a game about Slapstick per se.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
