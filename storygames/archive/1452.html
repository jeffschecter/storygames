                    Heya<br/><br/>I had a chance Saturday night to run a small game of Darby's Heroes, my submission for the Rev/Eng challenge. While there was much laughter and everyone expressed enthusiasm for the concept and the rules as I presented them, I qualify it as a complete failure. This is not me being hard on my work, but an actual failure. The players enjoyed themselves, because they did not see what I was doing to the adventure to adjust for play.<br/><br/>The concept was to play out a Dirty Dozen type of adventure.<br/><br/>1) I hadn't seen it in design, but there is a pretty high whiff factor in actual play. Giving players a limited number of dice to roll, with a 50/50 chance of having a success on any one of those dice, and then not having access to those comitted dice for the rest of the scene, nerfed the characters hard. The good news is that in play, I was seeing concrete ways to fix this error, that would actually change the mechanics quite a bit, but to fix this error, I also needed to address the other parts of the failure...<br/><br/>2) My intention with DH was to create color-coded scene blocks. If it's a Red Scene, it's about physical conflict. If it's Green Scene, it's about personal reflection. And so on. Ideally, an entire evenings play could simply be done by choosing color blocks, while stringing them together with the story-arc. I wanted to include more details about this in DH, but with limited time, it got a short shrift, which severly undermines the intentions. As a result, rather than feeling like everything was flowing together, it felt more like amatuer jump-cuts in a movie. I think there is a solid idea here, but execution needs a lot of work.<br/><br/>3) I had created a means for the players to create spotlight scenes for their heroes. To focus the adventure momentarily on their character, to address a Hope, Duty, Fear, or Fate. A secondary use was to give the heroes bonuses whenever a conflict arose in relation to the HDFF.  In actual play, the secondary use was constantly used (to mitigate the high whiff factor), while not once did the players choose to focus the spot light. Again, I think there is a solid idea here, but it needs work.<br/><br/>In conclusion, while it crashed and burned, it was also a learning experience, and I intend to make the most of it. However, before any work starts in earnest on DH, I'll await the judgement and comments from the Rev/Eng review phase.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading,<br/>Brent                </div>

                            Awesome!  A crushing failure is always a motherlode of useful insight into the design.  I think the color coding is a very interesting aspect you should definitely explore further.  Also, now that the contest is over, you can change that character sheet to better suit the game, rather than show-horning weird stuff into the design.                        </div>

                            Thanks Jason!<br/><br/>Yeah, when I became aware that it was not working as I had hoped, I made a conscious descision to just let it play out for fun (so that the players invested time was not wasted), and to make notes where and when something didn't work.                        </div>

                            Brent: I think it is AWESOME that you got so much info about your game idea, and have some clear ideas as to how to progress. In the challenge, we had to deal with the artificial constraint of not iterating on the character sheet. But now you get to run FREE! FREE!!!                        </div>
