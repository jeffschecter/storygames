I don't want to hijack the existing threads which focus more on player experience, so I'm starting this one for GMs to post and discuss <b>definitions, techniques, applications, theories and examples</b> of what some call "railroading" - as a literary and game-epistemological device used by both designers and GMs.<br/><br/>All aboard.<br/><br/><small><i><b>Important:</b> Please note that when I say "GM" here I am speaking strictly of single-GM-run worlds and game systems.

Would you say that's a bad thing, or does it simply let the GM "off the hook"?  For example, the DayTrippers module I posted is both railroady and sandboxy, but on different levels. <i>You really need to consider different narrative levels when you think about questions like this.</i><br/><br/>(Without giving away any spoilers... In that DT module it's totally possible to break out of the small railroad (the one that goes NPC to NPC to NPC) and you can sandbox around randomly for as long as you want, but ultimately the whole thing is moving along an even bigger railroad with basically two possible endings.)<br/><br/>So what I'm saying is: (1) sometimes the designer does the railroading, is there [in your mind] something wrong with that?, and (2) consider different levels of freedom and operational grainsize when looking for tracks, because while you have freedom on one level you are probably still being railroaded on another. ("The Quiet Year" comes to mind, but it's just one very clear example.) <br/><br/>And...<br/>Try looking at "railroading" as a literary device or technique. I think you can get a lot more mileage out of the word that way, rather than using it to characterize/stereotype whole people or entire campaigns.  To generalize, I'd say "railroading" happens:<ul> <li>In tiny segments - setups and action resolutions for instance - it happens in many or possibly most RPGs;</li>\n<li>In scene-sized segments it happens in many RPGs; it is a game mechanic in some, and a practical or literary GM technique in others;</li>\n<li>In session-sized segments it may also be used for either practical or literary purposes but depending on the style of play, if not used sparingly then it might indicate/be a potential problem with/for some players;</li>\n<li>In campaign-sized segments ... well, you are still "playing a role" but you're not making decisions that strongly affect anybody else's world. To avoid inevitable arguments I might concede that we should call this kind of game something else, like a "descriptive writing exercise from a fictional POV". Whatever. Art. It's a different kind of ride in the amusement park. It's like sitting on the train that goes around the park and looking at the tableaus, rather than getting in one of the bumper cars and choosing who to hit. (Note that riding on a train does not preclude all sorts of interesting interactivity - the conductor might give you a hand-job, for instance. Tiny little human comedies and dramas show up as "photographs" or "vignettes" and move by. The scenery outside the window changes. Ever ride a train? It's awesome.)</li></ul>\nThe "story" (whatever that means) can arise on more than just one level.  So. All that said, I still contend that there are things to be learned from the study and application of all narrative techniques - even so-called "dysfunctional" ones - that will only enhance the size of your toolkit and repertoire.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436258/#Comment_436258" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T13:50:53+00:00" title="August  2, 2014  1:50PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2014 11:21PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some more thoughts based on that post...<br/><br/>I think it's not possible to have a truly robust definition of the word "railroading" unless we consider differences between narrative tiers and what I earlier called "operational grainsize" (by which I mean the "size" of actions that are within the scope of a single character in a particular gameworld).<br/><br/>For example <small>(give me a little slack here, lots of things work like this, geopolitics, ecology, etc): </small><br/>If you're in a sandbox world and the GM lets you know there's a big war that just started a few hundred miles away, if the GM does their job right you will begin to witness the effects of that war, even if you never go near the front line yourself.  And eventually, someone will win that war, whether or not you even care who wins.  And when that happens, some things in the game world will change forever, totally beyond your control.  In fact, even if you were active in the war, that's far from a guarantee that little ol' you could have singlehandedly changed the outcome of the entire war.<br/><br/>Kinda feels like it would be the <i>player</i> doing the "railroading" if they <i>insisted</i> epistemologically on their "right" to affect the outcome of that war, or to stop the war.  Maybe they're not even close enough to get involved; after all, the world is a big place.  But they can still be affected: tariffs, embargoes, shortages, deaths of friends &amp; relatives, etc.<br/><br/>Some questions...  <br/><br/>- If the GM gives them a story in which they take part in a major battle but it's not the <i>pivotal</i> battle that literally decides the outcome of the war, has the GM committed "railroading"?  <br/><br/>- If it comes down to a question of "Who has the <i>right</i> to say they can <i>definitely</i> determine the outcome of that distant-but-significant war: the Player or the GM or both" - what would you say?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436266/#Comment_436266" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T16:19:46+00:00" title="August  2, 2014  4:19PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2014 4:26PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tod (AsIf),<br/><br/>It probably won't come as a surprise to you that I disagree with your premise here, and therefore can't easily answer your questions. It seems to me that you use the word "railroading" to mean something like "predetermine something about the outcome of fictional events in the story", or "a game which includes events or circumstances which certain players cannot influence".<br/><br/>My personal understanding of "railroading" as a useful term (which I do not claim to be universal, of course) was described in that other thread. It involves blocking player intentions on a social level as well as taking away their right to certain valid game moves/options. If we were playing Checkers, it would be me saying, "No, don't move that piece there. I don't accept. Make another move instead!", and refusing to play along until you did.<br/><br/>As I said before, this makes it impossible for me to engage with your concept of "grainsize" when it has to do with railroading - I don't see the connection.<br/><br/>(If you want to collect opinions and such in this thread, I could go find some of the things I said earlier and paste them here. Let me know. I think I was fairly clear in that thread, and I don't have time to re-type all that.)<br/><br/>Because of this, you may just want me to stay out of this thread. If you do, let me know, no hard feelings!<br/><br/>That said, I'll answer your questions (with numbers added for clarity):\n<blockquote><br/>[1] Kinda feels like it would be the <i>player</i> doing the "railroading" if they <i>insisted</i> epistemologically on their "right" to affect the outcome of that war, or to stop the war.  <br/><br/>Some questions...  <br/><br/>[2] - If the GM gives them a story in which they take part in a major battle but it's not the <i>pivotal</i> battle that literally decides the outcome of the war, has the GM committed "railroading"?  <br/><br/>[3] - If it comes down to a question of "Who has the <i>right</i> to say they can <i>definitely</i> determine the outcome of that distant-but-significant war: the Player or the GM or both" - what would you say?</blockquote>\n1. Yes, quite right. If the System in use does not normally give the players the ability to affect the outcome of that war, then this player is trying to move someone else's game pieces. (As opposed to, say, Microscope or some similar game - perhaps an AW game where they have a move which allows them to "Hold 1. Spend your hold to say how a major war turns out", where they would be quite right to say that.)<br/><br/>2. No. Why would it be?<br/><br/>3. I would say it depends on the game being played and the group, but whichever way it falls, it should be negotiated and agreed-upon. In most traditional RPGs, I think everyone accepts that the GM decides the outcome of something like a large-scale war. Sometimes there is an understanding that the PCs' actions (carrying out an assassination during a key battle) are effectively the turning point upon which the war will resolve. In other games, I could see the table as a whole taking a vote or rolling a die (or deferring to a third party) to figure out which way the war goes.<br/><br/>But none of those seem to me to have anything to do with railroading. In each case the group has an agreed-upon method for resolving the outcome of the war, and they use that method when they play the game. It's no different than, for example, the expectation that when I join a D&amp;D game and make a character, I can choose her class freely. That's usually the standard, I think, but if a group agrees to do things another way, why not? <br/><br/>It only gets weird when no one knows which is the rule, and it's applied differently in case A and case B. If I joined that game and was told that Lucy would choose my character's class instead of me (and with no regard to my wishes as a player), while half of the players got to choose freely, and Lucy herself was always forced to play a Magic-User by the GM, and I would be kicked out of the game if I didn't agree with this... that's when I'd start asking questions.<br/><br/>I'm a firm believer in the Lumpley Principle as a basic building-block of RPG theory (and RPG play), in case that helps you understand my answer.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436267/#Comment_436267" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T17:05:02+00:00" title="August  2, 2014  5:05PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldn't think of shutting you out of a thread, Paul, but I do plan to use this thread to talk about the technique in ways which are broader than your definition.

If writing a specific ending into a game is "railroading" [e.g. Montsegur 1244, or My Life with Master], then I'm not sure we can really describe as much of gaming at all as "not railroading" - it's all just matters of degree. Is a player who tries to survive a dungeon fight, and saved three Hero points, which he knows should let him win the fight, "railroading" his way to victory? I suppose that's your point here, but I don't really see how that definition - everything is railroading! - is useful to us.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>I'll also quote myself from an older thread. This little breakdown I made while back might help people connect through the use of (hypothetical) examples:\n<blockquote>'Railroading' (using your authority over the game or over the other players to push the game towards a pre-planned outcome) is certainly a technique, and a nuanced one. Its appropriateness depends on the game and the attitude of the players. These are all quite different:<br/><br/><b>* You are playing a traditional game (GM + players) with a pre-set "plot" structure (Scene A, then Scene B, etc.). <br/></b><br/>A range of possible ways it plays out:<br/><br/>A. The players know the sequence of Scenes, and have assented to follow them.<br/><br/>B. The players know that there EXISTS a sequence of scenes, and have assented to follow it, but do not know the scenes themselves, and are looking forward to finding out what those are.<br/><br/>C. The players know that there EXISTS a sequence of scenes, but are interested in pushing the story in other directions (towards their particular characters' pursuits -- in other words, are not assenting to follow the sequence), while the GM tries to keep the game "on the rails". This is known to the players, in other words, but not explicit.<br/><br/>D. The players do not know that there is a sequence of scenes, and the GM tries to keep the game "on the rails". The GM doesn't mind if the players discover this fact, however.<br/><br/>E. The GM and game system/rules claim that the game is completely open to player initiative, but the GM is trying to "railroad" the players into a specific sequence of events without letting them know that's what he or she is doing.<br/><br/>F. The GM and game system/rules claim that the game is completely open to player initiative, but the GM denies this and is trying to "railroad" the players into a specific sequence of events, while the players stubbornly try to break free of the secret "road".<br/><br/>I don't know if I've covered everything (and railroaded/non-railroaded elements can cover different parts of the game, like a scenario which is open-ended until the very last scene, which happens no matter what). But there's definitely a spectrum, and different ways the players of the game can interact with the element of potential "railroading". Some of these will be functional (conducive to the goals of the game), others will be utterly toxic. <br/><br/>I'm guessing the toxic types happen when either:<br/><br/>a) the players (including the GM) feel that they are being lied to or otherwise deceived, so their trust in each other is undermined, or<br/><br/>b) the elements being railroaded are the same elements that the players care about most. (For example, in a game where a player cares most about testing his or her character's ability to survive various combat encounters, that player will be very frustrated to discover that the outcome of combat encounters is rigged, whether in their favour or not.)</blockquote>\nA through F line up with Forge-definition Participationism, functional Illusionism, and dysfunctional Illusionism, just with a more thorough breakdown.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436269/#Comment_436269" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T17:23:46+00:00" title="August  2, 2014  5:23PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2014 5:37PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a really interesting "game" - it's autobiographical and completely "railroaded", in order to portray a certain experience to the player. <br/><br/>It's obviously not an RPG, but we can easily imagine an RPG like this.

However, what people usually mean by the word has much more to do with the purpose of play: you're railroading when you obviate choices that the other player views as legitimately theirs.<br/><br/>For this reason Tod's war example likely does not involve railroading in most games, but it might in some: for most games a far-away war is just background activity that does not impinge upon the specific role and purpose of a given player, and thus its outcome may be safely ignored. In some few games all facts are important and everybody has a say on them all, and in a game like that it would indeed be "railroading" of a sort for a player to claim illegitimate authority. <i>Universalis</i>, for example, is such a game: any player who cares about that war's outcome has equal means to influence it, no matter what other characters or setting pieces they might also be managing at a given time.<br/><br/>That subjective nature of railroading means that we can't discuss railroading separate from the specific game - there needs to be at least a creative agenda and defined player roles before we can know which specific choices by specific players count as railroading.<br/><br/>In practice "railroading" is only ever discussed in the context of a traditional adventure roleplaying game set-up where each player controls an individual character to either solve a mission, explore a setting or depict that character, while there's also a GM who is responsible for providing adversity, revelations or simple interaction. It's important to understand that even when we limit ourselves to such a specific type of set-up, the specific acts that are problematic "railroading" instead of ordinary GMing moves differ based on the nature of the given game. To be specific: players formulate their own understanding of the social contract of playing the given game, on the basis of their understanding of what the game is about, and this understanding then defines their expectation of how others will play. When other players over-reach their boundaries, that may be called "railroading", particularly when it's about the GM imposing predetermined plot outcomes in a game where the other players weren't expecting or desiring such.<br/><br/>A simple example of why the far-away war and its resolution might not be railroading can be found in how D&amp;D is set up: the players of D&amp;D are concerned about overcoming interesting challenges (for the argument's sake - in practice there are other reasons for why people play that particular game), which they expect the GM to provide. Unless their characters are established in a position to influence the outcome of that far-away war, they never interpret the war as an established challenge; a player who would arbitrarily take it as such would be considered a fool due to how arbitrarily they're avoiding the ordinary challenge negotiation process (they're not waiting for the GM to offer the opportunity to influence the war, but rather demanding it as if it was their unilateral right). Therefore, from the viewpoint of the players, the far-away war is merely a matter of GM background narration: its outcome is setting flavour, not a plot railroad, because it is not a plot, and it does not concern their characters. If the GM were to use the war to justify utterly fucking over the PCs later on, that would still not be railroading - it would just be bad GMing, no different from the GM declaring a meteor shower that destroys everything the PCs held dear. (That's not to say that foreshadowing future challenges with e.g. a distant war is not a good practice - it is, because it makes the setting more flavourful, but that does not magically take away the necessity of making adventures interesting! A well-foreshadowed foreign war or not, either the knock-on effects of that war need to be constructive regarding exciting adventuring, or the campaign needs to end for being unbearably shitty now that the GM "ruined it" with his stupid war.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436271/#Comment_436271" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T17:30:26+00:00" title="August  2, 2014  5:30PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2014 5:45PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Eero.

Retire it forever from actual analysis.  "Railroading" is for describing constrained player choice only when it doesn't matter to anyone why the choice was constrained, whether it was worth it, who was how much on board, etc.  <br/><br/>If that stuff <i>does</i> matter to you, don't talk about railroading, talk instead about:<br/>1) what it is that players cannot control, and<br/>2) the methods used to achieve that<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, that's always a productive starting point into any discussion of the myriad issues associated with railroading.<br/><br/>Example: "I wasn't allowed any control over the characters' path forward, and the GM usually acted as if we <i>were</i> controlling that."  Now we can talk about the pros and cons of player plot control, or the breadth of taste on that front, or why the GM did that, or better ways fro the GM to have gone about it, etc.  Most discussions that start by including "railroading" or "illusionism" take a while just to get to that point, and by the time they do they've often sprouted distracting tangents.  Blagh.<br/><br/>I do wish I could have come up with a clearer phrase that "characters' path forward", though.  Some terms for types of player agency would be sweet.  The Forge's 4 types of Authority* are okay, but doesn't cover everything re: railroading, I don't think.<br/><br/>*Ron defined them as Content Authority (back-story), Narrational Authority (what happens, how it happens), Plot Authority (revealing Content, mostly) and Situational Authority (scene framing, mostly), but never bothered to publish my glossary update which included them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436275/#Comment_436275" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T21:03:29+00:00" title="August  2, 2014  9:03PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2014 12:12AM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent suggestion, <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a>.  Part of what started this discussion (back in the other thread) was that the word seemed nebulous to some of us (but highly charged nonetheless).  Stepping back conceptually, I think that what we call "railroading" in various circumstances could reasonably be seen as a special case of (whatever word we decide means "seizing of narrative control" or "absence of narrative control").  Ethical considerations are potential factors in these situations, but not necessarily definitional or causative ones.  Furthermore, depending on the game/adventure, that absence can be either ontological or epistemological (relative to the viewpoint of a character in the game world).<br/><br/>ETA: Eero, I placed the war hundreds but not thousands of miles away to imply that players actually <i>could</i> reach it if they wanted to, as well as to guarantee that they would be affected by it beyond their control.  I was not clear enough on that point.  But my real focus was - as I think you noted - whether or not the players would consider it their "right" to affect it since it definitely affects them, and it's on a track of some kind, and it will continue until it ends, which is when the GM decides it ends.  I do note the observation of relativity and context in your post, and I appreciate that.  However I also acknowledge these aspects (relativity and context-sensitivity) only further complicate the possibility of coming to an objective technical definition of the word.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436276/#Comment_436276" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T22:33:13+00:00" title="August  2, 2014 10:33PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2014 11:31AM by AsIf.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More thoughts on the above...  A big shortcoming of the word "railroading" is that <i>unless</i> its definition is expanded (as I have done but others don't), it really only serves a pejorative purpose, and it only applies subjectively, from the player's point of view.  When it works gracefully, players neither know nor care, and generally don't use it to describe their experience.  But whether it works or not, GMs on the whole don't use the word to describe what they're doing either, because they don't think of it that way.  (And this is totally aside from any question of the individual GM's ethics or ego.)<br/><br/>It's not only possible to be "railroaded" in that sense and not know it, it's also possible to be certain that railroading is occurring when in fact it isn't.  I've had things happen in games that looked SO MUCH like railroading it's astounding.  You probably have, too.  Here's an example...<br/><br/><div>14 January 4437: En route to the city of Sanctuary, Blandisford Barter (PC) encounters an Elven minstrel on the Bridge at Three Roads Crossing. The RunePlayer introduces himself as Rimsel (NPC), and informs Barter that he has been sent by the Council of Deneldor to oversee the halfling's progress. Unfortunately, some evil priest's spell bound him to this bridge several days ago, and he is unable to overcome the magick. Blandisford uses the Codex of Truth to call upon the power of the deity and free his Elven ally, who repays him with a much-needed clue...</div><br/><div>11 January 4437: Bearing west from Sanctuary, Rakasha (PC) is stopped by a party of Deneldoran WayGuards, sent by the Council to secure the Bridge at Three Roads Crossing. Their leader, Rimsel the RunePlayer, is disgusted by the Evil One's presence in the land, and the group engages Rakasha in a duel. Quickly dispatching the lesser foes, Rakasha turns upon Rimsel, whose eerie fluting begins to weave a potent spell in the air. "You shall not cross this Bridge!", Rimsel sings through his flute. Rakasha shouts a quick obeisance to his evil deity, resisting the spell so mightily as to reflect it back upon the Elf, who is rooted helplessly to the spot. Rakasha leaves Rimsel behind as a symbol of his superiority, and continues west...</div><br/><br/>Note that the second encounter described above occurred after the first in realtime, but <b>prior to</b> the first in game time.  When Rakasha came to the bridge the Blandisford encounter was still fresh on my mind, and I "tempted fate" by putting Rimsel in the WayGuard party.  It was a total whim.  What if he got killed?  I have no idea what I would have said if Rakasha's resistance roll hadn't handed me the perfect result.  Not only did Rimsel survive the encounter, but the reflected spell totally explained why he was stuck there in the other encounter!  When the die hit the table and that 20 showed up, I felt like I had just shot a perfect basket from halfcourt with one hand, backwards, blindfolded.<br/><br/>Anyway.  The vagueries and baggage of the word "railroading" seem to make it unsuitable as a technical term, or as the name of a GM technique, or as a type of pacing dynamic...  Even though <i>functionally and objectively</i> speaking, <i>something almost exactly like it</i> is consciously applied in all of these situations and many more, on many levels of the narrative, all the time.<br/><br/>Either we need a word that speaks to <i>that,</i> OR we need to expand the word "railroading".<br/><br/>I originally sided with the latter prescription.  <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> is causing me to consider the former.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436281/#Comment_436281" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-03T02:00:14+00:00" title="August  3, 2014  2:00AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2014 2:00AM by Rickard.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It probably won't come as a surprise to you that I disagree with your premise here, and therefore can't easily answer your questions.

But I may be fighting a losing semantic battle here.  <br/><br/>Something else occurs to me that might partly explain why the word sounds different to me than it does to Paul: Because of my years as a strongly "Simulationist" GM, and because of my approach to interactive fiction in general (which reaches beyond TTRPGs and into other mediums), my definition of "railroading" is both good and bad, because it extends to <i>all</i> direct applications of narrative intentionality to fictional events without any challenge or justification by pre-established action.  Which means pretty much anything short of a 100% dice-driven sandbox includes some kind of railroading, which of course means GMs are railroading all the time.  And that's why I come down so hard on the question of artistic merit and egoless GMing.  On my view, that's how we determine the good railroading from the bad.<br/><br/>Fudging the dice is an example of railroading, because it is denying the system its own voice and substituting your own; but that doesn't tell us whether you did it <i>for</i> the players or <i>against</i> them, it doesn't tell us whether you were <i>creating</i> a more dramatic experience or <i>detracting</i> from one.  Another example: Creating a massive storm to prevent your players from moving in a certain direction until something else happens is railroading, but again, that doesn't tell us whether you were doing it to save your little pre-planned plot from being broken, or whether you were heightening the dramatic tension so your CoC game would feel more like CoC should feel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436285/#Comment_436285" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-03T02:28:22+00:00" title="August  3, 2014  2:28AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>I think there's a lot to say about "railroading" from the GM's standpoint, from the designer's standpoint, and from a sheer definitional standpoint</blockquote>My two cents: it's a vague and messy term.

("The Quiet Year" comes to mind, but it's just one very clear example.)</blockquote>\nI've come upon at least three different reasons of why a gaming session becomes linear.<br/><br/><b>The Designer. </b> John Wick wanted to show that he didn't design for linear play so he created <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvANYBRWo" rel="nofollow">The Dirty Dungeon</a>. The funny thing is, it's still linear. It doesn't matter if it's the players or the game master that comes up with the scenes, if they must be played out they will be linear. (Should say that Dirty Dungeon got twists. These are not part of the linear play.)<br/><br/>I've been analyzing 10-15 roleplaying games in how they suggest that the game masters should create adventures. Sandbox, linear play, fish tanks and collaborative storytelling (Swedish: samber\xe4ttande - a better suited word for it) were the main categories that I found. I also had Flags and Bangs as one category, but I wonder if it's not part of the fish tank or collaborative storytelling. Some games has several suggestions, like <i>The Spirit of the Century</i> and the Swedish <i>Hammarn och trollsp\xf6t</i>. <i>Trail of Cthulhu</i> got a case of multiple personality disorder, because it mashed together the fish tank (creating a skeleton with possible outcomes) and linear play (one clue leads to another scene).<br/><br/><b>The Game Master</b>. When I first started out playing the <a href="http://www.gnomestew.com/gming-advice/the-fish-tank-as-a-mystery-2/" rel="nofollow">fish tank</a>, a model to create open-ended scenarios, I discovered the it had a lot of similarities to the linear play. Imagine the story as a line.<br/><br/>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br/><br/>Both linear play and the fish tank uses this line to set the background (set in yellow below). You could turn the whole line yellow and then play from there where you have no idea where it would lead, or you could have no background at all and the whole story ahead. The game master could dump the characters anywhere on this line, which means that anything to the left will become the background.<br/><br/>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br/><br/>The difference is that in linear play, the story will continue as the line shows, but where the line is just a possible outcome in the fish tank\u2014a status quo that will create consequences when the players breaks it ... because they will, and it's expected of them. Something I noticed is when I got feedback from the fish tank, game masters that were used to playing in a linear matter played the fish tank in the same way. So it's possible to play a fish tank in a linear way, and play a linear story in a fish tanky way. I guess the same thing goes with Bangs, but I haven't game mastered using that technique.<br/><br/><b>The Players</b>. But why does linear play happen? I believe, like <b>2097</b>, it's part of who controls the story. A case I think is typical for linear play is when a game master usually creates a story on beforehand, and the players are afraid stepping over their boundaries and making things difficult for the game master. This is apparent if you play an open-ended game with a bunch of players that are used to railroading. They wont take any initiative and instead waiting for something to happen, or they wont describe an area that the traditional game master controls (like environment or characters) in fear of destroying the game master's plans.<br/><br/>[edit] I also had players that acted in a way that they thought were expected of them. I had players that said, when I played a fish tank, that they didn't like the how they were railed, when all they did was doing what they thought I expected of them. All I did was changing the open-ended scenario after their plans, so they sort of railroaded themselves?<br/><br/>I think linear play usually have a higher success rate in creating successful stories, because the designer of the story has more control. I'm not saying you can't create great stories in collaborative storytelling but I haven't cracked why it becomes successful in those manners, where I do have done that with linear play.<br/><br/>So now you've read through all of this, and you have probably just replaced "linear play" with "railroad". So what do I mean with "linear play"?\n<blockquote>I think it's not possible to have a truly robust definition of the word "railroading" unless we consider differences between narrative tiers and what I earlier called "operational grainsize" (by which I mean the "size" of actions that are within the scope of a single character in a particular gameworld).</blockquote>\nI agree with this, and over at the Swedish community, I tried to establish weak rails versus hard rails. When I talk about linear play, I do think of how I play <i>Feng Shui</i>, as an example:<br/><br/>- A fight in the beginning, and a fight at the end. I'm giving the players a goal in the first fight, and it's up to them how they will take themselves to the last fight. They can do whatever they want but, in the end, there will be a fight. They can't avoid it. This is to me a weak rail.<br/><br/>A hard rail would be to have established scenes that everyone need to follow. It could also control which characters that the players should control, to be able to control the story even more. <i>Montsegur 1244</i> comes into mind.<br/><br/>Linear play is both. It's when scenes are prepared and needs to be executed. Not in any particular order, but in some cases, they do. It's also when any decision along the way will lead to the same end scene. You know the the antagonist will die in the end of <i>American Beauty</i>, but you don't know the road that will lead up to that. Don't you agree with this definition? Then you probably understood everything I previously wrote in this post wrong. Reread it with the new thinking in mind.<br/><br/>Neither the fish tank, collaborative storytelling, or bang play got the end scene that is typical for the linear play. Computer games do, and they are all(?) a medium for linear play.<br/><br/>So I guess here is a fourth reason of why linear play occurs: <b>The Medium.</b> It can be more suited for it, or it's a limitation that forces linear play upon the designer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436288/#Comment_436288" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-03T03:33:37+00:00" title="August  3, 2014  3:33AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Linear play is both.

That's probably one reason why it's hard to talk about this way of playing a roleplaying game.\n<blockquote>ETA: But (3) another example would be a postmodern story structure that jumps around the same event from POV to POV, or (4) a "Slaughterhouse 5" kinda thing that moves forward and backward in time.

Judging from your examples, it seems like it's more of an exploratory game play in the style of sandboxes.<br/>- if it's fixed order of scenes, but jumping in time, it's still linear play. "Scattered chronological order", if I crudely translate the Swedish term from literature. The movie Memento has a reversed chronological order, with the ending scene first, but it's still linear (because it's a movie).<br/>- if you can take any scene in any order, and letting any scene become the last one, it seems to me the same thing as visiting any place in a sandbox in any order. The important thing is what you find in each scene (or "place", in the sandbox). If you don't wrap it up, I'm having a hard time saying it's has anything to do with linear, assembly, or ballistic play because it's not steered. A true sandbox doesn't have an ending, in my opinion. It can however run out of things to explore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436296/#Comment_436296" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-03T06:30:56+00:00" title="August  3, 2014  6:30AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2014 6:33AM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wasn't aware that there were limits on the types of games we were discussing! :-)<br/><br/>I lean toward insisting on the difference between lines and assemblies.  Partly because for the sake of completeness we will need to consider them both in their planned forms and in their emergent forms, and also in interrupted or moribund forms.  I think assemblies will become more important when we begin speaking of multi-tiered narratives and massive multidimensional structures (like worlds or campaigns) with numbers of free-floating structures within them.  You may see assemblies as an edge case at this moment in the conversation, but I think the concept is important because it will eventually take us to "object-oriented" designs with stochastic aggregations leading to varying emergent plots.  In such a system it is possible for the GM to modify the railroad on the fly by moving whole sections around; and that is not possible with a linear sequence,<br/><br/>Memento is linear.  Don't be fooled by the fact that it runs backward chronologically.

Glad to see the discussion is ongoing, and developing.<br/><br/>The missing bit from my perspective is the Creative Agenda angle, which is a different way of distinguishing "good" railroading from "bad" railroading, and which I find entirely sufficient for this purpose.<br/><br/>ETA ("edited to add"): for a simple example, consider the hypothetical Feng Shui game which ends with a confrontation with the Big Bad. These are all *completely* different games, and if you're not all on the same page as to which game you're playing, you're probably screwed:<br/><br/>1. The last scene is the PCs meeting the Big Bad. What do they choose to do when they meet him?<br/>2. The last scene is the PCs meeting the Big Bad, and a big fight with him. Will they win the fight?<br/>3. The last scene is the PCs meeting the Big Bad, and a big fight with him, which ends with the Good Guys winning.<br/><br/>What you guys are discussing now sounds to me simply like "creative constraints", particularly on a story/plot level (for example, when we play Fiasco, we know that most characters' stories are likely to end badly, and that we only get four scenes per character - I find it very bizarre to refer to this as "railroading", or any other term we want to use in its place). But this is an interesting discussion of their use and role in games. I dig.<br/><br/>It also makes me realize that I might never have played in a good railroaded game (at least not since I was a young teenager). The closest I can think of is a Monsterhearts game, in which the GM pushed very forcefully towards a climactic ending in the time-slot provided (it was a one-shot). However, I hesitate to call that "linear" or "railroaded", because we always had the freedom to act, and the GM always accepted and built on all our contributions. In other words, the GM was working to build *some kind of* climax, and carefully timed to line up with the length of the time slot for the game, but I don't think anyone (including the GM) knew what it would look like.<br/><br/>How would you describe or categorize that in this way of looking at GMing/scenario design?<br/><br/>(And, just for curiosity's sake, I really really enjoyed that game. It was fantastic! However, I do think I would have enjoyed it a tiny bit more had the GM been less pushy about the ending. A less explosive climax, but put together with more freedom, would have been more interesting and satisfactory for me, I think.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_436321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436321/#Comment_436321" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-03T11:44:22+00:00" title="August  3, 2014 11:44AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't like this idea of micro-railroading either.

Everything, and I mean everything, totally depends on what my understanding is of my role as a player (particularly as a non-GM player) in a particular RPG. I've taken to saying, "Expectations Matter," rather than "System Matters" because I think the former phrase actually boils down the major issues with the hobby to an even more fundamental level.<br/><br/>If my role as a player\u2014what kind of choices I'm expected to make, in other words\u2014isn't clearly explained to me, I'm going to be upset. That's really pretty much it.<br/><br/>ETA: I'm not saying this from the point of view of someone who is *entirely* "anti-railroading" particularly given the broad definitions in use here of the term. And I even think AsIf is correct that it is possible to railroad/predetermine things on one level of the narrative without predetermining all of them. But note that my proposal, to frame everything in terms of how the game's instructions are communicated to the player, deal with any possible issues surrounding those techniques.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436349/#Comment_436349" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-03T21:19:14+00:00" title="August  3, 2014  9:19PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2014 9:25PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Expectations Matter.  I agree with that.  But different artforms have different expectations, and some of the games already residing under the ever-stretching aegis of "RPG" are so different from each other as to be effectively different artforms.  (Fuckin' Yay!, I am <i>all for</i> ludological diversity.  I just don't give a shit about the state lexicon.  It doesn't change fast enough.)<br/><br/>But that's not to say it's impossible to model one artform within another, or to build a third thing which has aspects of both.  I'm not very interested in classifying today's or yesterday's games.  I'm more interested in tomorrow's games.  <br/><br/>If a system's primary priorities are to be plot-based, then other considerations will have to be descended in priority, at least to the degree that they must be safeguarded from undermining the primary priorities.  And therefore, subsystems for guidance of those secondary priorities will need to be established.  This is a structural issue that impacts not only player immersion, but the very flow of functionality.  It is important.<br/><br/>Imagine a modern branching drama game where the expectation is that the system provides a dramatic arc, a consistent world, a coherent plot, a cathartic climax, and a karmically-fitting denoument, like a well-made movie.  I don't necessarily need to explain all the kinds of choices you might make before playing because (for example) I could prompt/query you as you go along, whenever you hit a node (i.e. a branchpoint requiring resolution).  Or something equally wow.<br/><br/>Ok, now imagine another game with the same plot-based expectations but where I don't build paths between the nodes at all, I just scatter proactive NPCs, reactive objects and linking clues all over the place, and I make all your choices communicable literally through actions you perform with items in the game (like MYST perhaps?).  But it's a modern world.  It's basically a modern sandbox; there's no way I could relate all the possible kinds of choices available to you because they are as broad as the real world.  <br/><br/>Those two games are different not so much in expectations, but (more importantly from a design standpoint) in <i>infrastructure.</i>  Still, for both games, since "railroading" typically functions as plot-insurance, an important design question is to what degree "railroading" as an artistic technique can be subsumed into the system and gracefully employed.  The solutions will differ very much between these two games.  Now.  Questions of narrative control can be divided up into different levels, as we have discussed above.  In addition, stories are fractal in nature and the good ones are multi-tiered.  All these levels can be written so as to affect each other.  And the mechanics for all this stuff can be taken up in the design of the system itself, or it can be addressed in an ad-hoc fashion by the performance of individual GMs.  Or both.  So that's a design question too.<br/><br/>I assure you we are not overthinking this.  We're barely beginning to think about this.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436357/#Comment_436357" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-04T06:52:22+00:00" title="August  4, 2014  6:52AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course I'm not arguing that you should tell people ahead of time *what* choices they will face in the game. What I *am* saying is that people need to approach games with the proper orientation, including reasonable honesty about how much we can expect our decisions to impact big-picture outcomes.<br/><br/>This sort of framing doesn't *have* to be 100% explicit, but it should be close. If you pitch a game about a war as, "You are soldiers on the front lines. You won't have much say in your missions; the game is about whether or not you survive and how you process the horrors of war, losing friends, perhaps doing horrible things in the name of your country, etc," then it's pretty clear that my choices as a player should impact surviving missions and the moral impact of my character's experiences, but not whether we win the war or anything relating to big-picture strategy. Whereas if you make our characters generals and kings, it'd be pretty unreasonable for us *not* to be able to have an impact on the big-picture outcomes, without specific warnings to that effect: "this game is a tragedy and no matter what you do, your nation will lose the war."<br/><br/>So I guess what I'm saying is, make sure your *implicit* framing matches up with anything you tell the players *explicitly* about how the game's rules work or what *sorts* of choices they should expect to face.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_436361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436361/#Comment_436361" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-04T07:20:43+00:00" title="August  4, 2014  7:20AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2014 7:22AM by contracycle.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm 100% on board with what Deliverator says above.  Indeed, I think a huge chunk of the bad experiences people have had with this sort of play originate in setup.<br/><br/>One of the commonly held presumptions about RPGing is that you the player are entitled to make any kind of character you want.  What this often produces is a batch of characters designed with no relationship between each other, often in total ignorance of each other.  For the GM who is hoping to direct play through any kind of preplanned structure, however that is intended to be done, this presents a huge problem.  Because all these characters come with different backstories, all of them with inherent, implicit trajectories of their own.  None of them are designed to "interface", if you like, with the direction the GM is intending to go.  Often, their inherent trajectories are mutually exclusive.<br/><br/>Right there the GM is provided with a motivation to do some of the things we saw in WM's thread, such as hand-wavingly transporting the characters to some alien world where none of their backstories have any relevance.  That immediately trashes a lot of the players investment in their characters, but it usefully obviates much of the problem of their unrelatedness; now they are all in the same boat, cut off from their expected contexts, and ideally, "forced to work together". That, at least, is the GM's hope.<br/><br/>Of course it also leaves the players feeling like the GM has pissed on them from a great height, and not unreasonably so.  A much better idea would be to do as Deliverator suggests, to be quite open about how restricted the context is really going to be, for the GM to work directly with the players in constructing characters that will fit.  It's also, IME, a really really good idea to ban players from designing characters on their own, and instead to design them as a group, establishing explicit, even formal, relationships between them.<br/><br/>This requires slaughtering two sacred cows: namely, that the player has total freedom to design their characer, and that the PC's are going to be a bunch of disparate misfits brought together by circumstance.<br/><br/>This even has some implications for system.  Although I'm not familiar with the current state of D&amp;D, this type of character design is not going to be best served by a system that makes all "fighters" or whatever much the same.  If for example, all your characters are going to be members of the City Watch of Waterdeep, or something like that, you will need a system that would allow for <i>at least</i> five or six different "builds" of what might very well be the same "class" so that the players have sufficient means of personalising and variegating their characters such that they can have individual prominence, and make individual contributions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436362/#Comment_436362" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-04T10:03:29+00:00" title="August  4, 2014 10:03AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            /nodding.

It sounds like we're not really talking about *railroading*, but talking about story structure in RPG design. Is that on the ball, or a total misreading on my part?<br/><br/>(As a sidenote, and not entirely relevant, I suppose, is that my personal experience - and, I suspect, this is not at all uncommon among posters here - is one of great fatigue when it comes to pre-plotted gaming. Simply enough, if you are the GM in a game which runs on some kind of "rails", you don't get to enjoy playing in the same way that the players do. You limit your own enjoyment which comes from "turning the page", like in a good book. I think that, for a lot of people, this was the big revelation in "story gaming" - that you could have these same great stories without codifying them ahead of time, by focusing on good character design, relationships in tension, and conflicts. Finally the GM could actually *play* the game, and enjoy it as an audience member, reveling in the plot twists, instead of being a cat-herder who, in the very best scenario, simply gets to tell the story as he'd planned it. So that's another reason why GMs might not be too keen on pre-plotted, linear story: it dilutes the game experience, changes your role from someone who is playing a game and interacting with a story into a sort of frustrated director/manager. I'm always open to new surprises, however!)<br/><br/>This reminds of another kind of middle ground, which I see sometimes in games. It is, essentially, "Here is a thing you must/should/might include in the upcoming game." Good examples include Key Scenes in The Shadow of Yesterday, the Tilt elements in Fiasco, and Spotlights in Death School. <br/><br/>All the players know that these things are up for grabs, and should appear at some point. They give a sort of common focus or common direction to play: "Okay, we know that at some point the Hulk is going to be crushed under a ton of rubble, and then later burst out of there at a dramatic moment." Later: "You see a huge stone pyramid over there." "The assassin you're chasing runs inside." "The Hulk follows him inside the pyramid!"<br/><br/>Everyone knows what's going to happen, and we can collaborate to <i>make</i> it happen. But we don't know when or where it will happen, and there's always room for surprises (maybe the pyramid won't collapse on him this time, after all). <br/><br/>These "things" are kind of like signposts, in a sense. Or beacons in the dark. They give the players (GM included) something to aim for together in the murk of roleplaying, some focus for where the story will go.<br/><br/>Every game has lots of implicit beacons, as well. Character Flags were once a big thing; we don't talk about them much anymore, because I think most of the people who like them have internalized the concept and "forgotten" it. If you buy your character an ability to survive an unlikely situation by escaping from his or her bonds, you can bet someone else at the table is going to try to get them tied up at some point. Key Buyoffs in TSoY are another good example: that character with the Key of the Coward will a) have scary stuff thrown at them (or pursue it herself), and b) very likely, at a suitably dramatic moment, have a change of heart and overcome her fear.<br/><br/>They can even be written into the fictional content, like Uriah Flint in Lady Blackbird. There's no rule that says you must meet him, but in most games we will be curious to meet him, and to see what happens when Lady Blackbird faces him.<br/><br/>All these seem to have little to do with railroading, to me (which I see as a social phenomenon, as Matt and contracycle describe it above - broken expecations). But if I think of this as story structure in RPGs, there are a million things to explore, I agree with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436418/#Comment_436418" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-04T17:58:46+00:00" title="August  4, 2014  5:58PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2014 6:02PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wish I could go with that, Paul, because it would make this conversation a lot smoother between you and I, but it leaves out a lot.  For one thing, "story structure" can be emergent.  Hey, it happens.  I think we should be a bit more specific since we're trying to build an approximation you can work with.  I was thinking a good interpretation for you might be more along the lines of "<i>enforced </i>story structure" and maybe even "sometimes with an element of misdirection, illusion, deliberate predestination and/or no choice". <br/><br/>But that's still not complete.  Because sometimes (most often, in my experience) it's not the <i>whole</i> structure (the "story") that one might be trying to preserve.  You might have no idea where the story is going, but you still want to "railroad" something in order to preserve something else.  Sure, sometimes it's plot.  But sometimes it's mood or tone.  Sometimes it's an NPC, or even a map.  Or your labor in general.  Sometimes it's time.  Sometimes it's a crutch for newbies.  Sometimes it's the game experience of a player who couldn't make it tonight.  So now I have to amend the interpretation to say "enforced <i>elements</i>".  You can see how it's getting rather broad now, which makes me think "aw fuck, just use the old word - which we seem to agree doesn't really work anyway - and reclaim it".<br/><br/>Yeah, that's just me.<br/><br/>Oh but also this: It sounds like you're still thinking of the <i>entire</i> session or campaign as the thing that gets "railroaded".  Remember that I'm not necessarily speaking of <i>entire</i> campaigns or <i>whole</i> sessions, and I'm not categorizing GMs as "railroaders" and "non-railroaders".  Enforced elements can be injected on many levels, in large or small pieces, they are more often used tactically than generally, and are often found in the designs themselves.<br/><br/>Ultimately, what I'm trying to get to is an understanding of the word in which the <i>old</i> definition is seen as just a particularly nasty subset of the new definition.  Because all of these things are examples of enforced elements, and all of these things may be done for good or bad reasons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436419/#Comment_436419" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-04T18:05:21+00:00" title="August  4, 2014  6:05PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2014 6:07PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, that certainly clarifies what you're looking for. I still can't think of it as "railroading", but I'm on board with exploring it!<br/><br/>(And, no, I don't see what it has to do with scope. Sure, as you say, the "enforced elements" can be minor/tactical or larger in scale. I don't see a difference in terms of the theory of the thing.)<br/><br/>ETA: I'm also going to get over my fear of spoilers and read your DayTrippers adventure to see if an example helps clarify things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436420/#Comment_436420" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-04T18:26:29+00:00" title="August  4, 2014  6:26PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2014 6:27PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right on.  I think we can talk now!<br/><br/>Here's a case somewhere in the middle, as I see it.  This is not a "typical" case, but there's no such thing as a typical case by my definition, unless the GM is neurotic about it.  So just for one example:<br/><br/>If I throw storms and minor foes at the party all night long and force you to slow your movement to the point where it will be impossible to reach the next town before the end of tonight's session, even though it should have been simple, and if I did this all because Rickard couldn't be here tonight but I knew he would be here next week and I wanted him to be there when you entered the town's gates, simply because I believe he will want to be there...  that's not about story, but I'd still call it railroading.<br/><br/>If that example <i>doesn't</i> fit under the word we already have, then it implies that we're gonna need a whole <i>slew</i> of new words to describe all the various possible methods and reasons for enforced elements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Railroading Theory - A Functional Analysis - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19643/railroading-theory-a-functional-analysis/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Railroading Theory - A Functional Analysis - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19643/railroading-theory-a-functional-analysis/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content='Maybe every time someone says "railroading" I should just ask "with or without tickets?"

I use this particular technique all the time in the more positive light of "side quests". If I've been foreshadowing an event that is going to highlight a particular character and they aren't here on game day but will be next week, you can bet that there will be something interesting to ensure that the right people are there to make the best of the scene or situation.<br/><br/>This actually worked out very well a few weeks back. It went something like this brief AP.<br/><br/>We had a mad scientist character who had crafted stabilized crates to hold a shipment of volatile explosives that the party was hauling back to their base. The prior session, he had failed his crafting roll. As I often handle rolls like this, I told him the crates would work for a time, but would fail at a very bad time in the future. Everyone in my group was very excited about this since they knew that the situation was going to get crazy when this stuff went up, however it wouldn't have been dramatically appropriate for the explosives to go off when the character who caused the mess wasn't there to try to right the matter (and was the only one who could feasibly attempt to right the matter).<br/><br/>Thus, instead of them heading straight back to base I simply asked them what rumors they had heard about the area they were in. Someone mentioned magic bullets, so the session was about finding some magic bullets which turned out pretty solid. I clearly let the players know that the reason we were doing this side quest was to ensure that our scientist was there for the fireworks.<br/><br/>Our next session was a blast. The fate of the party's town (containing their base of operations) hung in the balance as the explosives went volatile just as the party pulled into town. Everything hinged on a single roll by the mad scientist which I spelled out before the roll was made.<br/>Crit Success - The explosives stay put despite the shoddy crates.<br/>Success - A few contained blasts and fires here and there.<br/>Failure - Several major buildings blasted and burnt to the ground.<br/>Crit Fail - A holocaust to be remembered for centuries.<br/><br/>The dice were whimsical: a crit fail was rolled and hijinks ensued as the party fought fires to ensure that their investments in the town weren't incinerated. All of this over a crafting roll.<br/><br/>Without "railroading" the party into taking a side quest so that the scientist could get his spotlight time things would have been much less dramatic and interesting.<br/><br/>Keep this in mind: I run about 90% improv / 10% prep with this particular campaign. I usually have a handful of scenes or hazards I prep, then fill in the blanks with whatever follows logically from the fiction. My prep is approximately 1 notecard per session.<br/><br/>I feel that failing to deliver on the promised spotlight time for this character (the scientist) would have been the real railroad here, being railroaded by the need for illusory "simulation".<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436428/#Comment_436428" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-04T23:25:07+00:00" title="August  4, 2014 11:25PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2014 11:33PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Calling things like, "We're going, as a group, to arrange matters so that we can play out this significant scene when Player X gets back next week" <i>railroading</i> is hurting my head.<br/><br/>I think I will just sit out and watch/listen/read for now!<br/><br/>(Dave, I like the "ticket" metaphor.

Railroading is one of those "Soft Skills".  This is a <i>massively</i> complex area of discussion replete with gems of wisdom and flags of warning, if you consider it <i>functionally</i> rather than <i>structurally</i>.  That's <i>exactly</i> where I'm going with this thread.<br/><br/>It's also a <i>fractal</i> field of inquiry, meaning that you can explore it on any level and find similar dynamic patterns or procedural questions repeating from level to level.  You can also find subjective and/or cultural <i>differences</i> between the ways the problem is parsed by different people on different levels.  It's interesting to observe how it is accepted on certain levels without question, resisted on other levels without tolerance, advocated on some levels by game rules themselves, criticized on some levels as a deficiency in GMing or authorship, and either distributed or debated on other levels depending on the game and preferred playstyles.<br/><br/>That's why a taxonomy of "ticketed or unticketed" can be meaningful on one level, but insufficiently nuanced on another.<br/><br/>I contend that there's much to be learned here, far beyond our outmoded definitions and entrenched ideologies of play.  This is a big blurry ball of theory that might give you a headache.  And I'm setting the controls to steer directly into it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436459/#Comment_436459" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-05T09:59:02+00:00" title="August  5, 2014  9:59AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of the times I talk about railroading I mean both the ticketed and the unticketed varieties.<br/>I\u2019ve had a lot of similar issues with both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_436487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436487/#Comment_436487" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-05T16:14:29+00:00" title="August  5, 2014  4:14PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>The issues that are actually <i>tricky</i> are the ones of <i>intermittent</i> or <i>unskilled</i> railroading, where it's hard to call the GM on techniques that don't <i>define</i> the game, or it's hard to request artistry the GM may not be capable of.

Quite often it's just been a case of assigning absolute authority to the GM accompanied by an injunction not to take any lip.  Compounding this is the fact that what is mostly discussed are games where people encountered problems, and walked away annoyed.  <br/><br/>Now this makes me wonder, by analogy, how good a musician could you really be, if you had no corpus of music to listen to and learn from?  There could easily be a big difference between the artistry a GM is capable of, and that which they know to do.  Stuff like the sudden transport ot an alien land, or the unkillable villain, these seem to have been invented and reinvented for as long as I've been reading accounts of other people's play; I think a lot could be done by simply discussing and hence propagating better ways to solve these common problems.<br/><br/>Soft skills can be taught.  I used to do telephone work; one of the things I was taught is that phones chop off the upper and lower bounds of your tonal range, which is one of the reasons that arguments are much more likely to escalate in a phone conversation than face to face.  Knowing that equips you to make allowances if something you do annoys the other party and vice versa; knowing that gets you better results.  I think WM's GM might have attained better results if he had seen Apocalypse World's dictum to "be a fan of the characters".<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436491/#Comment_436491" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-05T18:04:32+00:00" title="August  5, 2014  6:04PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2018 8:41AM by AsIf.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/contracycle">@contracycle</a> you are absolutely right.  "The Art of GMing" as represented in many books and conversations has been either rigidly controlling or diversively communal.  Some people are incapable of seeing it in anything other than black or white.  That needs to change, because in point of fact, every GM (and nearly every game design, to some degree, tacitly or explicitly) uses these techniques to some degree.  It's the <i>talentless</i> applications and power-mad bastards we've all heard people complain about, and a sort of hysterical response built up around the subject.  Many of the talented have been shamed by no more than parlance into keeping their mouths shut about the nuances of their art.<br/><br/>That any artist should feel ashamed to talk about their art in a public forum dedicated to their medium is disgusting.  It is a sign of an entrenched ideology.  Prejudice.  Artistic bigotry.<br/><br/>Another thing, related tangentially: Many game designers seem to think of the GM as a robot who does what they're told, rather than an artist who brings their own interpretation to the work.  Designers should see GMs more like the way playwrights and screenwriters see directors.  And GMs should be as proud of their soft skills as theater and film directors are.<br/><br/>When you can bring your players an experience that changes their lives, makes them cry, or causes any other sort of bleed, you have scored a major SUCCESS in my book, friend.  And as long as it worked, I assure you from experience that the player <i>really doesn't care</i> about the mechanics of <i>how</i> you did it.  They only need to know what it <i>felt</i> like.  Getting there takes compassion, insight, tact, artfulness, and a willingness to let the player be the source of the motivation.  In short, exactly the opposite of what "railroading GMs" have a reputation for.  Nevertheless, the most dependable way to get to that point is knowing when and how to railroad certain things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436493/#Comment_436493" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-05T19:46:22+00:00" title="August  5, 2014  7:46PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2014 7:47PM by Deliverator.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to cite Luke Crane's games as having a nice balance.

I learned to carefully read people since I was a kid, and as a comic writer, I'm familiar with thousands of plots and twists from many kinds of forms of fiction. So, GMs have actually a hard time trying to play illusions on me.<br/><br/>In a separate note, asking one of my players if he remembered one time that I railroaded him, he couldn't pinpoint some specific moment. Either I was a terrific illusionist then or haven't otherwise made memorable railroading scenes, though I remember making illusioninsm left and right on every campaign.<br/></blockquote>\nI seem to see a common theme (and I would agree about this myself): "We GMs, with experience, can pretty much always spot railroading, so it must not be done very well. But when we do it, it's artful, and the players don't notice at all."<br/><br/>I wonder if this affects our perception of the issue?<br/><br/>If you spend all your time as a GM, and you feel you're railroading with skill and for the right reasons, but other people "just can't do it right", which means it grates on you... is it possible that your perspective is somewhat skewed?<br/><br/>It's easy to find GM accounts of how they skillfully railroaded something, and player accounts of how much they hated getting railroaded, but when I asked people to post their positive experiences being railroaded as players, everyone responded with, "Hmmm, I can't really think of anything, sorry."<br/><br/>Is it possible that one's perspective on this tool is biased if one is only ever a GM or only ever a player?<br/><br/>It seems to me (again, I could be wrong) that whenever we get these threads about railroading and similar techniques, it tends to be people who are "full-time GMs". I don't often see <i>players</i> starting threads about how they like to be railroaded, or how they wish GMs were more forceful with their plots, or how they wish the GMs would control the story but hide their manipulations...<br/><br/>I could be reading too much into this, of course. It could be a coincidence, or some confirmation bias on my part.

Looking at the first edition of Drakar och Demoner from 1981, we see (page three):\n<blockquote>The GM should prepare a game world and then run it impartially. Often he or she prepares some monster\u2019s lair where the players then enter. It\u2019s the GM\u2019s job to run the world, creating excitement for the players. But GM has to not let their own feelings cloud the judgment, even if the players are close to killing the GM\u2019s favorite monster.</blockquote>\nLooking at the fourth edition from 1991, we see on page eight of the GM booklet:\n<blockquote>Imagine a rollercoaster. It\u2019s similar to an RPG adventure. First the events are escalated (during the first climb) then more or less exhilarating events occur (larger or smaller hills) before you reach the climax (the loop) and there the adventure ends.<br/>First the GM must have an idea for the adventure. The idea has to fit into the environment and keep to the same style. The style of Drakar och Demoner has some pillars, it has to be fantastical, very heroic and dynamic, very mysterious around monsters and magic, excitement in battles, despair when all hope is lost and the corresponding leap of joy when you find the unexpected salvation.<br/>Ideas for adventures can be found in movies, books, comics, images et cetera.</blockquote>\nOn page five of that same booklet we also see \u201cAnother reason to make hidden rolls is that the GM can change the result if it doesn\u2019t fit the plot that he has imagined.\u201d<br/><br/>Obviously something happened in that decade.<br/><br/>My charitable reading is that GMs were running location-based sandboxes for a while, got tired of it, found that they wanted to encapsulate the highlights of play along with what they saw as the best moments from fantastical fiction, and gradually drifted play and prep from an open-ended setup to specific events and scenes, with occasional illusionism or force effects. They then wrote the GM guides and booklets to reflect how they were trying to play now, including a big focus on Rule Zero.<br/>However, simulateously to the evolution for the GM-facing parts of the game to go to fewer and fewer rules and more and more focus on specific events, scenes and force techniques, the player-facing parts of the game evolved to have more and more detail and \u201crealism\u201d and complexity. It took quite an effort to build a player character with that 1991 box.<br/><br/>The problem was for those who never got to experience the simpler location-based play. My first RPG was that 1991 edition and I just couldn\u2019t understand it, there seemed to be so much missing.<br/>What I call \u201c90:s style games\u201d often try to bootstrap directly into this drifted play, with calamitous at worst, and vague at best, results.<br/>It\u2019s no wonder that we had a generation of railroaders here in Scandinavia.<br/><br/>Looking back at these games now and they look almost ridiculously front-heavy to the point of falling over, with their heavy focus on rules, rules, rules for the players to follow, whereas the GM is given encouragement to tell a story like a movie or a book, with guidelines that would make more sense in a writer\u2019s workshop than in a game aid.<br/><br/>So in the OP of this thread asks for constructive ways to make a sequential or structured story that can go beyond just a picaresque narrative.<br/>And I do have suggestions for this.<br/>I\u2019d take a look at games like Fiasco with its set amount of scenes and simple rules. It\u2019s predetermined that there will be a mid-story tilt, that half of the scenes will end badly, and a specific structure for the end result and denoument.<br/>3:16 is another interesting game with a set structure (planet hopping leading to hatred for home), support for the GM (threat tokens), and player\u2019s can add color via the flashbacks.<br/>Another thing to look at is the Storytelling Adventure System that Onyx Path uses these days. It\u2019s a highly proceduralized method of setting up prepped scenes with flexibility in what sort of adventures \u2014 open or linear \u2014 they can build. It puts the bootstraps and GM support back into the 90:s style of gaming.<br/><br/>More generally, for those wanting to design a railroading game: <em>Create structure</em>. Build the whole game around how you want it to be run.<br/>How to create and frame scenes, mechanically. Think about how the game will be used by people who are not you and don\u2019t have the experiences of various playstyles that you have.<br/>You say \u201cmastery is hard to build\u201d. Then the games should\u2019ve had more support for the structures and stories they wanted to tell.<br/><br/>I honestly think this is why the Basic and Expert sets for Dungeons and Dragons were so popular in the US. The Basic set taught the DMs to build a dungeon and place the game there. The Expert set later added on how to add wilderness and context to those dungeons. The game didn\u2019t drop you in to the ocean with \u201cOK, DM, you should build a world for the players, enjoy!\u201d. It taught it gradually \u2014 it had support and structure for the game it wanted to be (location based).<br/><br/>Whereas Drakar och Demoner, 1991 edition, kind of <em>did</em> feel like it dropped you into the ocean with \u201cOK, DM, you should create a story that is exciting in these, these and these ways and is reminciscent of these, these and these media classics\u201d.<br/>I remember reading the player\u2019s booklets with its detailed and clunky chargen rules and thought \u201cWow... I don\u2019t get it, will the DM create a whole planet with rules as detailed as these? That\u2019s not possible... what am I missing?\u201d Later after reading the GM booklets I was disappointed and felt like it was even less than smoke &amp; mirrors. It was just admonishment to <em>create</em> smoke &amp; mirrors. It did not have support and structure for the game it wanted to be (epic yarn based).<br/><br/>This also feels like where the advent of story-games\u2013type games came from. Building the game directly to support a particular creative agenda. Most of those games have a lot of input from the players \u2014 in Fiasco, there is no DM at all \u2014 but here is where I would start if I were to attempt to build a functional \u201cCome be a part of the DM\u2019s (or the \u201cpath writer\u2019s\u201d) story\u201d type game. A game built from the ground up with that expectation and support for that style.<br/><br/>Also, interactive fiction. I love Photopia and Floatpoint and Spider &amp; Web, and many others. I like them for what they are \u2014 solitary experiences, exploratory rather than creative experiences \u2014 and even though I personally don\u2019t have much of an interest to take part in a group activity that similarly gives the main creativity/story role to the GM, their techniques are a good place to start if that\u2019s where you want to do. They\u2019ve done experiments with illusionism (Photopia in particular does this), non-linearity, multiple endings...<br/><br/>(This post is turning into a whole grab-bag of miscellaneous thoughts on railroading...) Speaking of \u201cpath writer\u201d, it seems to me that many more players are interested in experincing a railroad written by a third party (such as Pathfinder adventure paths or campaigns for Underg\xe5ngens Arvtagare) than a railroad written by the GM. I don\u2019t know really why that is... I guess people hear of these books and it piques their curiosity, they want to join in a shared experience with others who have gone through it. Like a video game. \u201cRemember when Foo died in the Legend of Baz?

Aside from pointing that out, I have no big disagreement with anything you said in your grab-bag of miscellaneous thoughts.  My campaigns are all sandboxes to this day, and they are all motivated by the players' desires.  <b>I have no desire to tell a particular story before coming to the table.</b><br/><br/>TF-1, however, is <i>not</i> an example of my home campaigns.<br/><br/>TF-1 is an introductory adventure to an abstract OSR ruleset which is intended to create a surreal experience, and therefore I took pains to make it butt-simple, non-lethal and high-concept.  As I commented to Paul earlier, it <i>absolutely</i> consists of two layers of railroad, one of which is easily ignored if the players choose, while the other is not.<br/><br/>ETA: Those "pixel-precise triggers" you see aren't precise at all.  If you read the DayTrippers rules you'll see that action resolution is full of narrative flexibility.  It's much easier to get an "And" or a "But" result than it is to precisely hit on an attempted action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436524/#Comment_436524" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-06T01:49:28+00:00" title="August  6, 2014  1:49AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I would want out of an introductory adventure to an OSR ruleset is something that is very much an open-ended setup \u2014 preferably a location with statted up NPCs and monsters \u2014 with as few scripted events as possible.<br/>The pre-adventure events, or \u201chow to get started\u201d, could be in a sidebar of suggestions and examples, not baked into the adventure.<br/>The ending events, or \u201cwhat happens after\u201d, are what breaks it for me.

Designers of cards for the game Magic uses \u201cred flag\u201d for much the same thing.<br/>A \u201csmell\u201d or a \u201cred flag\u201d means something that is not <em>categorically</em> wrong. It can be the perfect thing to do right there.<br/>But it does mean something that you need to stop, go \u201cWait \u2014 what am I doing?\u201d and consider carefully.<br/>In both coding and Magic card design, the problem also usually isn\u2019t right where you look, it\u2019s deeper. The \u201csmell\u201d is caused as an effect of the structure you were working on and you should dig a little deeper to make sure that everything\u2019s built on a good foundation.<br/>If you stop and think \u201cCan I solve this another way?\u201d, you often can.<br/><br/>It\u2019s not categorically wrong but it\u2019s an alert, a sign that there <em>might</em> be something wrong and that you have to take a good look on what you\u2019re doing.<br/>Sometimes after investigating you find that the right solution is railroading. Sometimes after investigating you find that there the reason, the problem you solved by railroading, can be bypassed some other way.<br/><br/>For example, many people railroad because they don\u2019t know how to prep a more open-ended situation. Which is understandable because it\u2019s hard to learn to prep like that without guides, tools or support.<br/>Instead of trying to solve the problem of \u201chow to run this linear scenario without railroading\u201d, I suggest \u201ctry to look at how to prepare a situation or location, rather than a scenario\u201d.<br/><br/>I take \u201ccategorically\u201d to mean \u201calways\u201d.

DayTrippers is supposed to be skittery and deliberately GM-ruley.  The assumption is that the GM gives a shit!<br/><br/>I also wanted TF-1 to work as a one-shot, which I think it does.  It's structurally bottlenecky, alright.  But if approached in a dialogue-heavy style it's really just about meeting a bunch of characters with different psychological issues.  Order doesn't matter.  I've only run it once so far, with a relative newbie to RPGs.  Getting through it is actually a piece of cake if the GM is your fan (which I am), and certain scenes prompted a number of strong emotions in the player, from hilarity to fraternity to empathy.  The vast majority of our gameplay was spent in character-to-character dialog.<br/><br/>(I'm still trying not to drop spoilers, as if it matters here...)<br/><br/>I consider it an interesting experiment.  While the overarching story is definitely on rails, the individual "ties" in the track (the NPCs in the various locations) are all very sketchy scenes with only a few IF-THENs and very little detail, leaving the players and the GM free to dance all over the place in a highly unscripted style.  In any given location, there's nothing prohibiting you from getting all <i>Lady Blackbird</i> and making up whatever makes sense to you at the moment.

If showcasing \u201cgood railroading\u201d is one of the goals of the thread, I mean. Bring it!<br/><br/><br/><br/>To me, I think the best way is to just be upfront, and sometimes a little bit meta, about it. \u201cMy friends, you\u2019re going to start this session/campaign in place X Y Z. That\u2019s just how it is. Here is how you got there... [super brief intro follows]. Now the game can start.\u201d<br/><br/>When I first saw the video playthrough of the Lost Mine of Phandelver, I was pessimistic. It seemed very much like a railroad. How were you going to get the players all the way from city X, along road Y, to the spot Z where W happens which leads to V, which is what appeared to be happening in the video?<br/>I\u2019m very bad at setting up rails and enforcing or manipulating players to follow them, so I thought I wasn\u2019t going to be able to run the module.<br/>The book is very scant on information about city X and road Y, which I thought I would need somehow.<br/><br/>Instead, thankfully, the module is set up like this: It starts with \u201cBefore play began, you [because of reason given], travelled from city X along road Y to spot Z. You are now at spot Z. During that travel, you probably got to know each other a little bit. What did you reveal about yourself?\u201d After a brief round of introduction, W happens. <em>Now the game starts.</em> If the players survive \u2014 not a given \u2014 then going to V is <em>one</em> of the choices. The players in the video pursued that choice \u2014 our table didn\u2019t, initially. (Not for lack of info \u2014 I as DM was clear to point out the way from W to V \u2014 but because they expended so many resources during W.) The booklet gives clear guidance on alternatives if the players don\u2019t want to go there. Later in the campaign going to V again was an option which they did pursue. Then there are many approaches on how to deal with V. V is a complex location rather than a particular pre-scripted scene or encounter, and some very weird and unexpected and fun things happened to our group there!<br/><br/><br/>So the take away is that if you want a certain thing to happen, just be upfront to the players about it, before the game actually starts. (Prep is play, too, but hopefully you know what I mean.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436538/#Comment_436538" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-06T05:09:04+00:00" title="August  6, 2014  5:09AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2014 2:32PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm gonna get some personal history out on the table, hopefully it will save me some wading through well-intentioned but foolhardy attempts to educate me...<br/><br/>- I'm 52 years old.  I've been GMing for 38 years.  Thousands of sessions, scores of systems.  You will <i>never</i> convince me that there's only enough space in this world for one style of GMing.<br/><br/>- It took me about a decade of full-time GMing to hone my style - a style that delivered sessions my players will never forget.  When I say "full-time" I mean it literally.  I had no job except writing and running games for the latter five of those years.  I was supported and housed by my players.<br/><br/>- In the late 80s I wrote games &amp; modules for Iron Crown, all oldschool, but I wanted to push the artform in new directions.<br/><br/>- During the 90s and 00s I worked in numerous interactive mediums: LARPs, MUDs, interactive fiction, CD-ROM adventure games, NPC AI systems, object-oriented design, virtual worlds, live internet theater, web-based mystery games, conversation bots, gamification, and software for writing and debugging narrative control systems.  I know some things.<br/><br/>- To this day I play and run both oldschool and modern games.  Usually alternating every other week.  I'm not an OSR purist.  I don't run one-shots or collab games in the same style as my home campaigns.  That would be impossible (and pointless).  I become what the system wants me to be.<br/><br/>- Collaborative stories are super fun, I love them, and sometimes they can get deep if you have a perfect mix of players.  But that usually isn't the case.  It's like trying to form the perfect band.  I've never had a storygame reach the depth and consistency of prose collaborations I've done with talented writers, for instance, and I don't find this surprising at all.  Because real literary art has things like subtext and superobjectives, which require didactic methodologies.<br/><br/>- My home campaigns, on the other hand, are an exercise in gathering psychic content via the osmotic membrane that is the player character, and creating logical semiotes to re-introduce themes and situations that emit (often tacitly), from the players themselves, through their PC sheets and in-character actions.  My ego/plot/desire has nothing to do with it.  My campaigns are about <i>you</i> not me.  I don't need a plot if I know what your motivating issue is (in this character, at this time).  Give me a session or two and I'll find a way to work with it.  And then I'll railroad it back to you, wrapped in color and symbolism.  And you will bleed.  (Although that's a very negative-sounding word, another one I don't like, just remember that bleed is not necessarily negative).<br/><br/>So there's that.  Now I'll get back to the point, thanks for your patience.  What am I doing here now?  I'm saying this:<br/><br/>The word "railroading", as typically understood, is a completely useless term.  See <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> et al above for the reasons why.  But the tactic of forcing a situation to arise by injecting narrative elements designed to push or pull the characters physically or emotionally in certain directions with as much expedience as verisimilitude permits - that is a real thing, much more subtle than plot-driving, and a talent that some people undeniably possess.  Ever play Fiasco with a professional screenwriter?  Yeah.  So I am attempting to reclaim and repurpose that word.  What we once called "railroading" is really just the lamest, most egregious and heavy-handed subset of all these techniques.<br/><br/>Thank you all, and I hope I passed the audition!<br/><br/>Sandra/2097 says: "Prepare a situation or location, rather than a scenario".  <br/>I say "Write scads of independent objects and let them run free, but push up the ones that resonate with your players' telegraphed intentions and responses, including the obstacles thereunto (which they unconsciously also desire), and help your players face and resolve those obstacles with one hand while appearing to oppose them with the other."<br/><br/>The GM is in the business of losing.  If they don't understand that, they shouldn't be trusted playing with the contents of other people's heads in the first place.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436539/#Comment_436539" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-06T05:36:45+00:00" title="August  6, 2014  5:36AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I knew about your age and your work for ICE.<br/>I didn\u2019t know you had worked with IF but that\u2019s good because then you\u2019d get my references to that, and maybe how I think they collide with stats-and-dice type play.<br/><br/>What you call railroading in this post, I've heard referred to as <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/theory/glossary/alphabetical/B.html" rel="nofollow">bangs</a>.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve been using railroading as another word for <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/theory/glossary/alphabetical/F.html" rel="nofollow">force</a> which meshed well with my interpretation of your ideas as railroading as something that can happen on various layers and scales, not just the larger sequence of events or scenes.

A few things I see indicated by this cluster:<ol> <li><b>Important:</b> Please note that when I say "GM" here I am speaking strictly of single-GM worlds and game systems.  I am <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> speaking of "the loose set of functions which can be divided amongst the group".  I do not need education on the fact that those functions can be distributed in some games.  When I say "GM" in this thread I am speaking about <i>one</i> person: the only person at the table who (on my view) is not playing a game, but providing a service.  Don't argue with that sentence; you know who I mean.</li>\n<li>In this model you can railroad <i>the system</i> in addition to railroading <i>the players</i>.  The system has agency, and the GM can take it away.  (The system never gets offended, but it does get bent, and sometimes they can break.)</li>\n<li>This conclusion should not be very surprising to those who know my preference for the GM "fusing with" the system.  In a sense I am saying that <i>Rule 0 is always railroading</i>  (from the system's perspective).</li>\n<li>Before I finished writing that sentence I already heard the disconnects coming.  So let me beat you to it: The very idea that the system might even be "offended" comes from a "Simulationist/Gamist" view of the game world.  I believe this is where a lot of "Narrativists" start to get off the bus.</li>\n<li>But that said (please stick with me Narrativists), I don't consider such railroading to be categorically wrong.  Those who remember the "I want to be a machine" thread will recall that <i>I am not opposed to Rule 0.</i>  That may seem like a paradox, but it's more like a hybrid approach.  Because what I'm doing <i>on top of that</i> "Simulationism" is in fact very heavily influenced by (and prescient of) "Narrativist" approaches and concerns.  I draw my ideas from the players themselves, just like Vincent et al, except I do it informally rather than formally.  The game world is just a backdrop to provide context and objects to act upon.  Ultimately the enjoyment and meaningfulness of the Players' experience is MUCH more important than the veracity of any simulation, or obeisance to rules.  Because if you're not satisfying your Players, then why would you even do this at all, right?</li></ol>\nI want to focus on artful/constructive applications of railroading rather than hokey/control-freaky applications, because the former are the ones that occur to me, and the ones I wish to explore analytically.  Yes, I do a lot of prep for these campaigns.  But I'm not precious about it.  It's more like prepping a shooting gallery or racking billiard balls.  The world and all of its elements are always ready and waiting to be impacted or fucked up by the players.  That's their purpose.<br/><br/>Ultimately, we - both the players and myself - are trying to generate <i>Meaning</i> here, in the art school sense of the word.  Whenever you get Meaning unfolding through a series of Events, you will <i>always</i> find that a "story" has arisen, ex-post-facto.  This is how life works.  We only see the "plot" after all this stuff has happened.  And that's why <b>there's never any need for the GM to railroad plot.</b><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436601/#Comment_436601" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-06T17:18:16+00:00" title="August  6, 2014  5:18PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2014 12:06AM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course if the module does it, that's a rather different question.<br/><br/>Personally I prefer to treat that question like a theater director considering an avante-garde script, or a movie house deciding to run a cult classic festival.

I wish you had started there! (Of course, maybe the whole point of this thread was to help you think through this avenue of exploration and to formulate this construction of "railroading" [which I definitely think is not a helpful term from what you're describing, and I submit this thread as evidence of that fact!], in which case you clearly couldn't have started by posting it.)<br/><br/>You're essentially, at least to my eyes, defining "railroading" as any human element involved in GMing which does not consist purely of "colouring between the lines" provided by the system (by providing Colour and employing human creativity where it is required (like describing a monster's appearance, deciding what trap goes in the villain's lair, or assigning a certain number of Hero Points to a certain NPC). <br/><br/>So the only GM who does not railroad is either a perfect machine, who follows all the procedures perfectly by-the-book, or a human being who is attempting to be such a machine, when s/he is successful. (I suppose we have a grey area when a module/scenario which calls for railroading is being perfectly carried out by a human being. Railroading or not? I don't know.)<br/><br/>This certainly makes sense, now, given your view of GMing as a machine-like task. It's pretty hard for me to engage with, since it's pretty much the opposite of how I see gaming - it's a much more traditional view of how roleplaying games work, the sort of thing that the Forge theory worked so hard to repudiate, with the game rules forming the "physics of the game world" and all that kind of stuff. But I think that now I understand what you're talking about, so that's good!<br/><br/>In your view, "Railroading" is the act of a GM who bends the rules and flexes the system in play in order to achieve a different result than "straight play, by the book" would normally give us. (Hence why Rule 0 is always railroading, for example.)<br/><br/>I certainly don't agree with this definition, but I think I'm starting to get it! Thanks.<br/><br/>Here's a question: does this mean that this whole concept is entirely impossible to apply to freeform roleplaying, or, if not, how does it function in that context?<br/><br/>(Note that I consider this an important question for any RPG theory to answer, since pretty much all roleplaying - or most, anyway - includes at least some proportion of purely freeform play, at some point in the process.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436642/#Comment_436642" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-07T11:23:57+00:00" title="August  7, 2014 11:23AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2014 2:32PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Took me a while to get to this point.

It has something else that needs another name.

It's only sociopaths who build massive railroads with no exits, branches, or breaks, leading directly into the laboratory of Doctor Doom. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nikolai" title="Nikolai"><img alt="Nikolai" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nikolai">Nikolai</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436656/#Comment_436656" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-07T14:33:05+00:00" title="August  7, 2014  2:33PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been following this thread closely, but I'm still not clear on the functional definitions of railroading that have been proposed.<br/><br/>AsIf,<br/>You mentioned there being two different GMing styles, the "Traditional GM" and the "Collaborative Story Facilitator".

If I were talking about a round-robin game I would have said "the <i>acting</i> GM" or "the <i>current</i> GM" but secretly I'd regret it the moment I said it, because the functions when shared do not possess the same type or amount of responsibility as when placed in one person.  So my phrase "collaborative storytelling facilitator" was an afterthought.  Not entirely serious, but useful as a placeholder term.<br/><br/>That's related to another subthread Paul will remember, about the stupidity of the terms "GM-full" and "GM-less" - which to many people mean <i>exactly the same thing.</i><br/><br/>Ever notice that our hobby is FULL of really really poorly-conceived terms for things?  There are many tangents we could run down.  But in this thread I'm attacking (actually reclaiming) the word "railroading", and single-GM games happen to be the clearest and broadest field in which I can observe this behavior, and to which I can apply this model.

I may have missed this in the big blocks of text trying to define it, but I really only caught arguments about removing agency of the players or removing agency of the system, and if that counts as railroading.<br/><br/>The reason I ask is because my ideal RP environment is that the system exists to support and justify the GM, and the GM exists to breathe life into the game world for the players. Breathing life into the game world can involve playing by the numbers, challenging the players in unexpected ways, or ushering them toward their own desired goal to have good times by all. Any time the players have their suspension of disbelief shattered or a sense their decisions don't matter, the game loses life.<br/><br/>I guess that's why I always had such a strong focus on improvisation in my gaming. If the GM is successfully playing off the cuff, he takes and legitimizes the ideas of the players and mixes them in with his own unique twist to keep things interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436668/#Comment_436668" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-07T18:14:45+00:00" title="August  7, 2014  6:14PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2014 6:28PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If a GM bends the rules of the game to take the players in a direction the players WANT to go, is this railroading?</blockquote>According to this view, yes.  This would almost certainly be a positive application of a railroading technique.  Again, there's no judgment here on the act of railroading itself.  The only judgment is on the subjective experience it generates in the players (and that it hopefully doesn't totally destroy <i>all</i>  verisimilitude - it must fit the "spirit" of the system and the game world).<br/><br/>Debatable is the question about whether it makes the game <i>better,</i> because handing them everything they want is just as pointless as refusing to hand them anything.  That question would have to be resolved on a case-by-case basis; it involves your intuition and some knowledge of your players.  Even the time of day can affect it (if it's getting very late, for instance, you will probably build a different section of track than you would in the first hours of the session).<br/><br/>Personally: Some players take a lot of initiative and I like to let them run with it (because it serves me too), but at a certain point (different in different games), I might say "you're stepping on my agency right here" or "you're taking the system's job right here" - then prune them back just a little bit and continue from that point.                        </div>\n<div

This robs the term of meaning, and hence I no longer even know what it is we're supposed to be discussing.  If everything is railroading, then railroading is nothing.<br/><br/>It's also analytically poor.  We're left in a place that makes it difficult to look at and understand why people have bad experiences; indeed, we've lost the term that used to describe a certain kind of experience, wherein the GM applied force without consent.  If "railroading" is now supposed to be ubiquitous, we're left with no general view, no broad analysis, merely a bunch of case-by-case judgements which reek of "I know it when I see it".<br/><br/>I don't think this is a useful road to follow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436680/#Comment_436680" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-07T23:31:06+00:00" title="August  7, 2014 11:31PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2014 11:31PM by 2097.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don\u2019t feel like I ever misunderstood the type of railroading that was meant.

When AsIf described his gaming style my reaction was \u2014 and is \u2014 \u201chell, no, I will never enter a table with a social contract with such play\u201d.

The first meaning describes the subjective impression of a player who either senses it used poorly or believes that they have (In other words, we already have an "I know it when I see it" situation, but the person who smelt it is not the one who dealt it, so they actually don't know whether or not that's what they experienced.)  The other meaning is a transitive verb encompassing a set of techniques deliberately implemented by a GM (or even by a player).<br/><br/>All judgment aside, we should be as scientific as possible: These are tools, they have no ethical value on their own, neither good nor bad.  <br/><br/>The first meaning is passive and subjective.  The second meaning is active and empirical (in the sense that the person who's using the tool knows that they are, and could even describe the precise properties and limits of the tool they are using.)  The first meaning isn't useful for the intended purpose of this thread, which is to analyze the second meaning, basically.  We have already uncovered a few specific techniques, and more will follow.  Certainly a taxonomy can be developed which differentiates more precisely than simply calling some techniques <i>good</i> and some <i>bad</i>.  <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> was making some interesting strides along those lines at the scene-plot level.<br/><br/>This model is not yet fully articulated, I'm attempting to give words to it.  It begins with an abstraction of various processes, viewed from a functional standpoint rather than a structural one or an ethical one.  Then the assorted structural impacts and ethical considerations will need to be addressed, probably individually.  It has already been mentioned that the problem domain is fractal in nature and the techniques are numerous, with different forms, sizes, and applications on different levels.  That's a lot to talk about.  I'm simply not there yet.  You've assisted me previously.  But if you list everything I haven't got to yet, that would be a considerable amount of work for you right now! :-)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> - Although I used my own campaigns as examples, there's no reason to assume that this model is tied to any particular GM's campaigns.  The tools of railroading (in my reclaimed sense of the word) are already encapsulated within various systems and play approaches; for good or for bad.  All I'm doing in this thread is isolating, analyzing and elucidating them.  That will take us to a point where contracycle's call for specificity can be met.<br/><br/>Ultimately this is just one guy's line of analysis, y'all.  <br/>Resistance from people who are not interested is...  odd.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436686/#Comment_436686" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T02:18:25+00:00" title="August  8, 2014  2:18AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2014 2:36AM by Paul_T.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I'm looking forward to hearing about specific techniques, I've been quiet for a while because I feel that the definition of "railroading" we're supposed to use here is so vague as to be useless.

Here is how I interpret you. A campaign structure can be linear, a scenario model can be linear, the workflow of a scene can be linear, smaller components in adventure creation (ex. clues) can create linearity (you said "clues in a mystery"). It seems like you suggest that anything the game master provides can be thought of linearity (where the game master steers the players). So I wonder what your thoughts really are.<br/><br/>I'm also brought up examples of when the players railroaded themselves, meaning that they did what they thought the game master wanted. (On a similar note, this is why I dislike XP for good roleplaying or descriptions, because it can create a behavior where you act out or describe in a way that you think the game master would appreciate.) But perhaps that's something else besides linear playing?\n<blockquote>Resistance from people who are not interested is...  odd.</blockquote>\nI stopped reading this thread when <a href="/forums/profile/Paul">@Paul</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/contracycle">@contracycle</a> came in with old baggage from previous theoretic discussions (from the Forge?), dragging along a lot of unnecessary but also negative viewpoints.

Something is on some rail every time a scene changes or transitions in play.  It is common to imagine this from the character's perspective, as though there is some kind of physical rail they "move along", and sometimes arguments arise as to who has control of "where they're going".  But that notion is actually a Simulationist illusion in its own right, one the Players willfully pull over their own eyes.  It's not what's really happening.<br/><br/>The characters don't exist.  They cannot "move" because they aren't real.  They are just written clusters of semiotes designed to signify affordances, detriments or color in a structured conversation.  You've heard Vincent say this before.  What's really happening is that some human Players are sitting there, and the human GM (as per the system) creates a "scene" by placing an imaginary description of a situation all around them like a 360-degree movie screen.  This imagined situation will take into account the characters motivations and whatever has happened in previous scenes.  In this 360-degree display there will always be some positive number of <i>rails</i> leading out of the current situation and on to another (the destinations of which may or may not even be known to the GM at this time).  I can think of at least 4 types of outbound rails.  The first is created by the GM, the second is created by both the GM and the Players, the third is created by Players alone, and the fourth is created by common assumptions and the ontology of the game world...<br/><br/><b>Explicit Rail:</b> If the GM says "Lady Blackbird and her companions are in a cell with one door", that door is an explicit rail out of this imagined situation.  Getting the door open will require some sort of action (in this case, the most commonly-thought of action might be "lockpick").  If successful, that action will put the Players on that rail and out of this scene.  An Explicit Rail may be hidden at first (it's explicit to the GM).  Perception rolls or other maneuvers may be required to gain a description of a hidden Explicit Rail.<br/><br/><b>Potential Rail:</b> The GM will no doubt describe other things, some of which begin life as mere color ("there are some pipes running along the ceiling, and a heat vent in the floor") and which weren't actually intended to be rails, but the Players in their ingenuity figure out a way to turn them into rails leading out of the current situation.  This is like a "banana game".  A collaborative (GM-suggested, Player-built) rail.<br/><br/><b>Eureka Rail:</b> The Players in their ingenuity make unexpected use of something on their character sheets or have a brilliant idea that no one foresaw.  A Player-built rail.<br/><br/><b>Common Rail:</b> The Players walk into a shop.  There are many tacitly-understood actions available here - you can buy things, maybe sell things, maybe talk with an NPC, maybe get information, and this will generally involve exchanging imaginary money for imaginary goods, etc etc.  Most of these are not rails because they don't cause a new scene.  They are only imaginary actions <i>fictizing</i> a transaction between the Player and the system which takes place on the character sheet (erase 3 GP and add "long sword").  But there are usually lots of commonly-understood actions that would indeed cause a new scene to occur - i.e. Outbound Rails - and everybody knows them.  The most commonly-used rail in the store would probably be "buy something and leave via the door".  That's a Common Rail leading to the street outside, and that rail was created by - eh, no one.  "Expectations of verisimilitude."  But there are many alternative ways out of this scene as well, i.e. tacitly-understood Common Rails which <i>will</i> force a transition to a new scene.  For instance, if the Players kill the shopkeeper and loot the store (which although heinous is in fact always an option), they have created a rail to a new scene - perhaps involving an escape from town and the long arm of the law.  <br/><br/>At times the GM will push stuff into the scene.  Maybe the Players run out of countdown time, or (per the system) a wandering monster check comes up positive, or they blow a roll, or whatever escalates, escalates.  In PbtA games these are called "MC Moves".  Their purpose is to complicate your situation, raise the tension, imply a threat/danger, or cause some kind of harm to you (penalizing the Player by making them perform subtraction equations).  But sometimes these things reveal new outbound rails.<br/><br/>When the Player has selected an outbound rail and gotten on it (either by succeeding in an action resolution attempt or simply by saying they're doing it), they have effectively said "There, I made it through that scene, now show me the next thing that happens".  At this point the GM (as per the system) describes the transition as they exit that scene.  (In actual fact what happens is that, again, the Players remain still while the GM describes the section of rail taking them into the next scene.)  The GM (as per the system) then describes a new scene representing the new imagined situation, which again will take into account all the characters motivations and whatever has happened in previous scenes.<br/><br/>I made a little picture...<br/><img alt="image" src="http://asifproductions.com/sites/default/files/scenes_with_rails.png"/><br/>The Players are stationary, surrounded by a 360-degree description, with rails leading toward them like the spokes of a wheel.  The Players can find or build additional spokes leading out of the current scene.  Note that the Players really only perceive the <i>near end</i> of these rails, although they may have some information on what they lead to.  Also note: Though scenes may seem to be synonymous with locations, in fact they are not, because multiple scenes can take place in a single location.<br/><br/>When done playing, the whole structure is nothing but a network of scenes with rails between them, and many dangling "dead" rails that lead nowhere because no one ever took them.  Often no one - not even the GM - will ever know where all these rails might go.  But for each scene, at least one of these rails <i>will</i> get the Players out and into a new one.  It may be one of the GM's rails, or one of their own.  Some may require a successful action before they can be used.<br/><br/>Let's say in the LB (Lady Blackbird) example they fuck up bigtime and the GM wants them to "fail forward".  GM says "You fail to be quiet while trying to remove the vent plate, which makes so much noise that the guards open the door and come running in."  The GM just pushed the guards into the scene with the Players.  The Players will have to deal with them now.  But a swap has been made: the cell door is now open.  The explicit rail with a "lockpick or banana" requirement has disappeared, and there's a new explicit rail with a "handle these guards" requirement.<br/><br/><i>"What do you do?"</i><br/><br/>Lather, rinse, repeat.<br/><br/>After a whole bunch of these little exchanges have happened, provided that the GM has taken care to present meaningful locations, NPCs, items and events for the Players to interact with, and portrayed them with mindfulness and respect for both the gameworld and the Players' motivations (stated or telegraphed), we will look back on this long series of little rails, which will <i>appear</i> to be a meaningful story.  And so it is.<br/><br/>Although a drawn line connecting all the scenes in all likelihood would wander all over the place, from the Players' perspective it might appear to be straight.  If the session went extremely well, or if it contained a few meaningful coincidences (syncronicities), the Players might even believe they have been "railroaded" the entire time.  But the fact is they don't know.  If the GM did their job well, they simply don't know.<br/><br/><b>The Fully-Linear Plot</b><br/>We are now in a position to look again at the "fully linear plot" - purview of the "railroading GM" (in the old sense of the word).  The fully linear plot is a set of scenes (a) that the GM knows completely beforehand, (b) each of which has only 1 outbound rail (typically explicit), in which (c) Player-created rails are either not accepted, or handwaved by fiat to trigger the next pre-detemined scene no matter what.<br/><br/>A fully linear plot is a tactical roleplaying exercise in which the POV of the protagonist is constrained by the GM, similar to the way a movie director points your gaze only at the things he wants you to see.  Although it <i>is</i> still an interactive game (at the move level if not the scene level), and while you <i>are</i> playing a role, the fact that there's only 1 outbound rail in each scene can quickly turn it into a game of "find the explicit rail" and gives it a very "Gamist" or puzzle-like quality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436717/#Comment_436717" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T12:44:10+00:00" title="August  8, 2014 12:44PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This didn't make any sense to me until I read "The fully linear plot is a set of scenes (a) that the GM knows completely beforehand, (b) each of which has only 1 outbound rail (typically explicit), i". So a rail is a way to end the scene?<br/><br/>I usually talk about canal locks instead of rails because "rail" is usually used as a shorter word of "railroading". That was what threw me off, and I think it has thrown me off in the entire thread. When you wrote "Sometimes the rails are in the design." in the second post, you meant "rail" as a gate from a scene to another, and not when the game master steers the players in a hard way?<br/><br/>Anyway, from your point of view, it makes sense. It's interesting to look at who transits from one scene to another, and what it does for the whole session. I never thought about that.<br/><br/>I think it can be a base for discussing how we play a session.<br/><br/>(And please, don't use acronyms in a longer article. Studies has shown that acronyms messes up the reading, and I even had to google PtbA. It's totally unnecessary to use LB, even if you talked about Lady Blackbird previously, unless you are restricted to a number of character.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436725/#Comment_436725" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T14:29:22+00:00" title="August  8, 2014  2:29PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Acronym expounded. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nikolai" title="Nikolai"><img alt="Nikolai" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nikolai">Nikolai</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436726/#Comment_436726" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T14:45:19+00:00" title="August  8, 2014  2:45PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AsIf,<br/><br/>Thanks for the write up and diagrams. This was very helpful and clear to me. I think we have a more clear framework from which to discuss railroading now, although I still think there is room for more precise terminology.<br/><br/>Your write up got me thinking about railroading from another perspective. I'll brainstorm a bit here.<br/><br/>The GM has a great deal of control over the level of railroading in their scenario, however I think much of this is handled without conscious thought.<br/><br/>Consider a dungeon.<br/><br/>The GM might make a dungeon...\n<ol>\n<li>a winding maze of interconnected passageways and chambers.<br/></li><li>a linear series of 10x10ft rooms with a large "boss chamber" at the end.<br/></li><li>a monster habitat built like an underground office building with numerous staircases, passages, and habitation areas logically laid out.<br/></li></ol>\n1. The first example is one where mapping might lead players to unexpected rails.<br/><i>This passage passes over the boss chamber. Lets dig here and get the jump on the dragon from above!</i><br/><br/>2. The second example provides very little possibility for player created solutions. The players will need to handle the hazards in each room in order in order to proceed, just as the GM expects.<br/><br/>3. The third example is one where logic leads to interesting conclusions.<br/><i>The kitchen is this deep in the Goblin caves? There must be a hidden tunnel that smoke from the greasy cooking fires escapes through that leads to the surface. Start searching!</i><br/><br/>Is the GM in example 2 is passively railroading without even realizing it? Each scene really has only one other possible scene it links up with.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436728/#Comment_436728" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T14:53:02+00:00" title="August  8, 2014  2:53PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2014 3:02PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Nikolai">@Nikolai</a> - Sure.

In that kind of roleplay, this is an interesting way to look at it:<br/><br/>It's essentially the opposite of the typical story game/Forgite perspective on how a sequence of scenes comes to be (with the notable exception of Vincent's "moves snowball" concept). The "exit point" of a scene largely determines where we're headed next, in this model.<br/><br/>So, like in a dungeon, the way you "exit" a scene is by moving into another one. This is a very different view than the more "story gamey" model, where scenes are "framed" and then "closed" (like in theatre), followed by a new scene being "framed" once again.<br/><br/>I suppose that's worth some thought. Do any usefu techniques come out of this way of looking at things? (Certainly "putting the game on rails" is an obvious one, but are there others?)<br/><br/>Tod, some questions:<br/><br/>1. It looks like you're defining "rails" here as scene transitions; something which carries you from one scene to the next. Is that what you've been talking about this whole time (while trying to define "railroading"), or is that just how it happens to look in this particular example of yours?<br/><br/>In other words, is this the phenomenon you're talking about, or is this just *an example* of how you see "railroading" (I still cringe at using that word in this context, just for the record) taking place in gaming?<br/><br/>(Yes, I'm aware that this concept is fractal in your mind - i.e. operating at different possible scales - before you go there.)<br/><br/>2. Is this model supposed to cover types of roleplaying other than the dungeon-esque "sequence of scenes" storyline kind of roleplaying, as we're familiar with from D&amp;D? Or is this a very specific model for only that kind of traditional play?<br/><br/>I ask because I have a great deal of difficulty seeing how this model could be applied to something like, say, Fiasco. Or any game with non-sequential play or other non-linear storytelling techniques. (Chapter play in <i>In a Wicked Age...</i> comes to mind, for example.)<br/><br/>3. Why do you feel that the action which effectively exits a scene is the important determinant in what the next scene might be?<br/><br/>I'm thinking of situations like:<br/><br/>-(GM) "Ok, you're in the shop, and after all your negotiations have concluded, the seller is offering you X deal. Will you take it?"<br/>-(Players) "Sure, let's buy the stuff and then get on to our next point of business."<br/>-"Great, add the stuff to your character sheets. What do you do next?" <br/>-"Ok, we'll head out to the street..." (i.e. <b>scene end</b>)<br/><br/>a. <br/>-"Ok, we'll head out to the street..."<br/>-"Ok, the sun is up and the crowds you saw earlier have mostly dispersed."<br/>-"Right, guys: do we need to do anything else here?"<br/>-"The evening's almost done - maybe we should just skip to the expedition?"<br/>-"Sure. The next two days pass uneventfully and you finally reach the dungeon entrance..."<br/><br/>or:<br/><br/>b.<br/>-"Ok, we'll head out to the street..."<br/>-(The Thief's player:) "But I'm staying behind. I'll hide until nightfall, and then rob the owner of the money we just gave him!"<br/><br/>c.<br/>-"Ok, we'll head out to the street..."<br/>-"In the meantime, here's what's been happening at the oceanside..."<br/><br/>d. <br/>-"Ok, we'll head out to the street..."<br/>-"I'd like to request a flashback, to see how different things were when we met the shopkeeper two years prior..."<br/><br/>And so on.<br/><br/>Thanks for writing this up - your perspective in this thread (or even series of threads) is becoming more and more clear all the time.<br/><br/>(edited for grammar and clarity)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436731/#Comment_436731" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T15:39:16+00:00" title="August  8, 2014  3:39PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mixed emotions here. I'm sad that I lost most of the discussion because of work, surprised that is has gone so far and grow into multiple threads, ashamed that my rants were the start of all this insanity and glad to finally open this can of words we all thought we had left buried behind us too long ago.<br/><br/>Anyway, I've been talking this out with a friend of mine while we were working on a game meant to be more simple and less numeric at handling an anime setting. The PCs are meant to be kinda OP, special abilities are quite versatile, HP is really low and as far as we tested the GM could have a really hard time implementing good challenges. And also, there's the railroading. We know our group needs a bit of railroading to keep them focused, transmit some suspense here and there, raise tension and help the pacing of the game. But instead of having the GM tweak creatures, npcs and mechanics for hours until he could produce proper railroading while risking making the challenge too difficult to the PCs, we started to work on a mechanic to railroad openly that players could felt a bit more natural.<br/><br/>We stole and hacked from here and there and ended up with two options so far. First one is like pathfinder's "mystic points". The GM gets an amount of points per encounter equal to the number of players. These points can be used to cheat the mechanics at a rate of 1 per turn max. These are only usable on a boss battle and the GM can spend them to avoid a condition inflicted by a PC, reroll a die, etc. The idea behind these points is to reinforce the feeling that the enemy is an actual challenge on the first moments of the battle, but since these points will wear down fast, the PCs will end up regaining the advantage soon (our game certainly gives PCs the advantage most of the time anyway)<br/><br/>The other option was a technique we call "Game Cinematics", which operates exactly as a videogame cinematic sequence. Players don't get to choose what will happen, GM narrates the whole part, but he's meant to use this to stablish the challenges that will come in the close and far future. Not a solution I'd reccomend for everyone, but since we kinda have experience with good and bad railroading I think we can handle it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436732/#Comment_436732" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T15:56:27+00:00" title="August  8, 2014  3:56PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2014 6:15PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I had a similar thought: it seems like this model is very much in line with a "dungeon crawl" kind of approach to roleplaying.</blockquote>If you keep in mind that scenes are not necessarily synonymous with locations, and that rails do not necessarily represent virtually-physical egresses, then it covers much more than dungeon crawling.  For instance, the "problem" in a scene might be verbal or psychological, say, overcoming an NPC's fears in order to obtain their assistance.  If the GM telegraphs that the NPC is willing but frightened, that would imply the existence of an explicit rail, as well as a maneuver to gain access to it (possibly a seduce/manipulate or maybe something else).  Whether in a dungeon or not, you are always surrounded by a scene, and the way to a new scene is always a rail laid by someone (even if it's laid by "everyone" as a matter of expectation/verisimilitude, e.g., walking out the front door into the street).<br/><br/>Advanced brain-twister: Due to the fractal nature of narrative, it's possible that walking out the door doesn't actually end the scene at all.  Imagine for instance those times in a computer RPG where you're wandering around town going into all these buildings you've already seen, trying to figure out a way to make a new situation arise.  At that moment, the entire town (rather than any individual building) might be seen as the "situation" that you wish to leave behind.  This makes me want to say "situation" rather than "scene".  In the above model I used those words rather interchangeably, but I'm now thinking they are really not completely isomorphic.  I need to think about that more.  The Fractal aspect allows "zooming in/out" which modifies the <i>size</i> of a scene, even if it doesn't "solve" the situation itself.  Hmm.\n<blockquote>1. It looks like you're defining "rails" here as scene transitions; something which carries you from one scene to the next. Is that what you've been talking about this whole time (while trying to define "railroading"), or is that just how it happens to look in this particular example of yours?</blockquote>Both.  The model above was an exercise I wrote to illustrate this viewpoint in which <br/><b>1. rails are a totally normal thing of neutral value</b>, and <br/><b>2. questions previously considered as matters of ethics may be viewed as matters of structure.</b><br/><br/>This gives us a more empirical position in which to stand when making judgments about them.\n<blockquote>is this the phenomenon you're talking about, or is this just *an example* of how you see "railroading" (I still cringe at using that word in this context, just for the record) taking place in gaming?</blockquote>You probably noticed that I stopped saying "railroading" above, and began speaking of the "rails" themselves.  I feel I may be creeping toward a semantic compromise in which it's the structure of the "roading", not the "rail" per se, that activates your Spidey sense and makes you say "I'm trapped in a linear plot".  (Although again, depending on the game, the playstyle, and the commonality of such plots, this may not be a "bad" thing.)\n<blockquote>2. Is this model supposed to cover types of roleplaying other than the dungeon-esque "sequence of scenes" storyline kind of roleplaying, as we're familiar with from D&amp;D? Or is this a very specific model for only that kind of traditional play?<br/>I ask because I have a great deal of difficulty seeing how this model could be applied to something like, say, Fiasco.</blockquote>I need to think about that before I can answer.  I'll get there.\n<blockquote>3. Why do you feel that the action which effectively exits a scene is the important determinant in what the next scene might be?</blockquote>It <i>may</i> be, but not necessarily.  In some cases everyone knows full well where a rail leads before taking it.  In some cases the GM will determine that by asking the system (encounter rolls, countdown clocks, random generation, previously-established NPC vectors, etc).  If we're in a "fully linear plot" then of course the GM already knows where he's gonna put you.  I'll look at your examples and get back to you with more on that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436733/#Comment_436733" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T16:10:31+00:00" title="August  8, 2014  4:10PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2014 4:12PM by Rickard.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I ask because I have a great deal of difficulty seeing how this model could be applied to something like, say, Fiasco.

(Not your fault; after all, I didn't explain myself.)<br/><br/>Tod's model, here, shows a type of play where a scene ends in a certain way, with choices made within the scene leading out of it and into a new scene. The "rails" are potential lines of movement from one scene to the next. We decide to break through the prison door... ok, now we have a different scene where we fight the guards (or whatever).<br/><br/>A game like Fiasco, though, doesn't require linear scenes at all. We can have Scene A which is Bob in the prison... and then scene B is about Jane at work in the office. Finally, Scene C is a flashback to Bob's childhood.<br/><br/>There's nothing "leading" from one scene to the next at all. (Hopefully, we will make some kind of thematic connections as players, to make the whole thing into a story and reincorporate elements or themes, but this could happen after-the-fact, or from a different character's unrelated scene, or many other possibilities. And the game doesn't require it at all.)<br/><br/>That's where I'm not sure how this model applies. That's how it's totally unlike a "dungeon"-type adventure where you move from one location to another (whether the locations are literal or just metaphors, like different topics of conversation).<br/><br/><i>In a Wicked Age...</i> is another example: we can play out one Chapter, then start a second Chapter... and, at the end of it, decide that, hey, obviously this second Chapter must have been earlier in history than that first one.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436739/#Comment_436739" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T17:08:55+00:00" title="August  8, 2014  5:08PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2014 5:11PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm not sure I fully understand common rails.

The key trait being: These are all the ways Players might force a situation/scene transition which are rarely explicitly described, but rather assumed because that's the way things commonly work in reality (ontology), and/or in the genre (simulation), and/or in the reality of the game world (previous knowledge about the game world).  <br/><br/>Is this rail type unnecessary or redundant?  I know it seems blurry, but I don't see them as Explicit Rails because there's no onus on the GM to describe them when setting the scene, and I don't see them as Eureka Rails because they require neither ingenuity nor action resolution rolls.  They are just <i>always</i> available, given a type of circumstance.  Downtime may even be a Common Rail, if the scene changes enough.  E.g.: <i>"Seen in the light of day, ..."</i><br/><br/><b>Re Metagaming for Rails</b><br/>Asking the GM a question <i>may</i> inject new data into the description which <i>may</i> establish a new outbound rail, certainly.  But depending on the kind of question, that rail may be of any type.<br/><br/>Explicit: "Is there a key mechanism on the lock that Snargle can insert a pseudopod into?"  "Yes."<br/>Potential: "Hey wait - air vent huh?  Is it possible to wedge something under the edge?"  "Huh!  Well... Yeah, maybe!"<br/>Eureka: "Wait a minute - Snargle changes shape and flows right under the door!"  "Holy shit!

Let's see...<br/><br/>I've said before that Fiasco (and similar games) actually have two games going on.  There's the "roleplaying game" in which characters face imaginary challenges, and then there's the "collaboration game", which happens not in any imagined space but right here in Reality Prime(TM).  The second is meta to the first.  The challenge of the collaboration game is to spontaneously create scenes that make sense given the genre and your character, even while you are unable to predict what the other Players are gonna throw at you.<br/><br/>I think in Fiasco the scenes can still be seen as connected by rails.  Because even though they may differ radically in time and space, the Player of scene 2 always starts their turn with more information than the Player of scene 1 had.  This information snowballs over the course of play and definitely affects decisions made in the collaboration game, which then go on to affect decisions and actions in the roleplaying game.  So their order matters.\n<ul><li> <b>If you Established the scene</b>, you might give yourself one or more Explicit Rails.  The other Players are going to create additional rails.  Typically they will also present obstacles and complications to your simply getting on an outbound rail.  But an interesting thing about Fiasco is that at this point, another Player actually has the option of "railroading" you, "pushing" you onto a rail that takes you out of the scene.</li>\n<li> <b>If you are Resolving the scene</b>, you are establishing an Explicit Rail for yourself.  The other Players present obstacles and complications.</li></ul>\nFrom the character's perspective, of course, those rails are only used for <i>egress.</i>  Get out, scene ends, done.  <br/><br/>But from the Players' perspective, they represent the chronological order in which <i>the audience perceives the movie</i> (which is not necessarily the same as the chronological order of events within the game world itself).  In other words, in each scene, the goal is to simply get through the situation, and although events that transpire in this scene <i>will</i> in all likelihood affect decisions made in the collaboration game and injected into scenes later by other Players, for your character right now it involves simply getting onto <i>any outbound rail</i>.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning" title="DustinDePenning"><img alt="DustinDePenning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning">DustinDePenning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436742/#Comment_436742" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T18:01:52+00:00" title="August  8, 2014  6:01PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I might be missing some things here \u2013 but it seems our definition of "rails" has far outgrown the classic implication of "railroading." <br/><br/>"Rails" here seems to describe "methods of resolution and/or transition to new events." Rails are neutral, and can be enforced negatively, positively, cooperatively, unilaterally, or randomly.<br/><br/>However, classic railroading seems to imply "Unavoidable events that pursue the GMs agenda." This might be an overly narrow definition, but I think that's what people really mean. So how does the original concept now link to our view of "rails?"

But rather because anyone after you inherits an operant space with a kitten in it.  They aren't obligated to use the kitten, but they are unable to contradict its existence within the timeframe you established it.  In other words, their absolute narrative freedom has been constrained - however slightly - by your kitten.<br/><br/>Granted, the model wasn't created to talk about Fiasco.  But it's working better than I thought it might.  This is probably a difficult example to see if you're not down with the model, and clearly you aren't.  But remember there are two games going on.  The way I see it looking through the model is: (1) a rail resolves a scene in the RP game as usual, "forcing" something in game-reality to have occurred and the scene to end.  But then (2) the moment it exits that circle in my diagram, instead of transitioning the player who's on it to another scene, it cuts or dissipates (or we simply stop looking at it), leaving nothing but the impression of its existence as a fact, and a hand-off to the next player.  In this way it impacts - however slightly - the possible options of all future players<i> in the collab game.</i>  It "points to" the next scene not in game-space, but in audience-space, where the movie is being "viewed".\n<blockquote>I guess I'm not seeing the connection from what we're talking about to anything related to what most people call "railroading" at all.</blockquote>That's trying to use one definition to define a different definition.  Of course that will make no sense.  It is not surprising that you can't map design ideology to functional analysis.  What <i>is</i> surprising is that you keep complaining about that, instead of just ignoring me.\n<blockquote>What's the advantage or purpose of using a "rail/railroad" metaphor for such basic elements of roleplaying (like establishing fictional details)? </blockquote>Because these are all members of the same species functionally speaking , and I am analyzing them from a functionalist perspective.  And abstaining from making moral and ethical judgments while I do so.  And collaborating with a few interested peers on the establishment of taxonomies, terms and models for talking about game processes from this new perspective.  That's all the reason I need, I believe.  Nobody's forcing you to read this.\n<blockquote>Have we gotten to the point where we've diluted this term to the point where it applies to everything and anything we do, period?</blockquote>Aside from the fact that the word was already useless and hyperbolic?  I'd say: In the most abstract sense, qualified yes, but not for every <i>little</i>  thing.  Any binding act of creation that affects any Player other than yourself is railroading, because it causes an undeniable/irreversible effect impacting upon their total narrative freedom.  My whole point is - has been from page 1 - that this dynamic happens <i>all the time,</i> and at various levels, and there's nothing "wrong" with it.  When viewing the game at the Scene Level, the significant rails are those actions or events which resolve a scene goal or force a scene transition, thereby ending the scene and transitioning to the next.  But there are levels you could examine both above and below that.\n<blockquote>Can you give an example of a fictional event which is *not* a "rail"? </blockquote>A memory described to you by another player in <i>A Penny for My Thoughts</i>  which you don't choose. =P  <br/><br/>No, but seriously folks: There are plenty actions that neither impact other Players nor force scene transitions.\n<blockquote>(Upthread you refer to a character choosing to "spend a night asleep" as a "rail", as well, which is pretty far afield</blockquote>Afield from where I started, yeah.  That's because in earlier conversations we were focused mainly on <i>GM railroading,</i> and I carried some of that into this thread, but as analysis proceeded it became clear that <i>Player railroading</i> also must be considered, and so the field of inquiry broadened.<br/><br/>I was still speaking only of GM railroading when I wrote this on page 1, for instance:To generalize, I'd say "railroading" happens:<ul> <li>In tiny segments - setups and action resolutions for instance - it happens in many or possibly most RPGs;</li> <li>In scene-sized segments it happens in many RPGs; it is a game mechanic in some, and a practical or literary GM technique in others;</li> <li>In session-sized segments it may also be used for either practical or literary purposes but depending on the style of play, if not used sparingly then it might indicate/be a potential problem with/for some players;</li> <li>In campaign-sized segments ... well, you are still "playing a role" but you're not making decisions that strongly affect anybody else's world. To avoid inevitable arguments I might concede that we should call this kind of game something else, like a "descriptive writing exercise from a fictional POV". Whatever. Art. It's a different kind of ride in the amusement park. It's like sitting on the train that goes around the park and looking at the tableaus, rather than getting in one of the bumper cars and choosing who to hit. (Note that riding on a train does not preclude all sorts of interesting interactivity - the conductor might give you a hand-job, for instance. Tiny little human comedies and dramas show up as "photographs" or "vignettes" and move by. The scenery outside the window changes. Ever ride a train? It's awesome.)</li></ul>\nThe "story" (whatever that means) can arise on more than just one level.  So. All that said, I still contend that there are things to be learned from the study and application of all narrative techniques - even so-called "dysfunctional" ones - that will only enhance the size of your toolkit and repertoire. <br/><br/><i>ETA: I've changed the title of the thread to better reflect what's going on here.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_436761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436761/#Comment_436761" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-09T05:58:59+00:00" title="August  9, 2014  5:58AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Because these are all members of the same species functionally speaking , and I am analyzing them from a functionalist perspective</i><br/><br/>I'm not convinced this is useful.

AsIf is trying to take a process (railroading) and determine what specific elements are being manipulated for this process to occur. (Much like chemistry doesn't make any sense unless you understand chemical bonds) In this, he's defined a new term: rails. Rails represent freedom of choice in handling a scene. More rails mean the scene has many open-ended conclusions; less rails means that the possibility space of the scene is highly constrained. <br/><br/><i>Railroading is the manipulation of rails to constrain the possibility space.</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Khimus" title="Khimus"><img alt="Khimus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Khimus">Khimus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436768/#Comment_436768" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-09T08:19:34+00:00" title="August  9, 2014  8:19AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2014 8:32AM by Khimus.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't see the conection either.

But rather because anyone after you inherits an operant space with a kitten in it.

But if a found kitten is a rail, then the hair color of the character is a rail, his sexual preferences might be a rail, everything is a rail, because every detail already established in the fiction constrains narrative freedom.<br/><br/>These concepts are metaphors. If you use the term "rail" for your model, it should be because the name helps people understand what you're saying. But right now, every scene sets multiple rails, and starts informed by multiple past rails. If I make a scene about your character, then I am constrained by him/her having a kitten, being a male/female, having x sexual preferences, having y job, being tall (or not), and whatever else has being said about her. How is this represented in your model, by multiple rails that end in this scene? If I established in a scene that she has a cat and is a journalist, does that mean I chose 2 rails as scene exits (probably many, many more)? So, if we were to see the rails created after a scene, should we jot down all the new info that informs future play, and say "player chose to go through these 16 rails during scene A". It doesn't make much sense to me... almost any info set during play constrains and informs future play: I can make a scene where the character finds her up in trouble due to being.. blonde, tall, whatever, and in scene 1 nobody could have predicted that that could be important.<br/><br/>The only thing true about your model is that, by the nature of language, narrative must always be linear and develops in time (which works well for a railroad model of narrative. But if your model is about "new information which *may* affect future scenes", I'd think about other, more useful metaphors. If every instance of play breeds info that informs future play, then we might say all that info is stored in a sort of collective memory, like a hard disk stored with bits of memory. When you store a bit, you don't know if it will actively inform future play or not (like the character being blonde). This only happens if a player deliberately uses that bit of memory as material for his contribution.<br/>Also, info may be forgotten, overlooked, remain unused. Probably, if a bit of info remains unused for 7 sessiones (imagine the first session we said my character has a nephew, but we never again refer to it), it will be erased from that memory, or be much more hard to bring back<br/><br/>It was so hard to write this in English, I hope it isn't a mess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning" title="DustinDePenning"><img alt="DustinDePenning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning">DustinDePenning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436773/#Comment_436773" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-09T10:42:08+00:00" title="August  9, 2014 10:42AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that it's useless to define any fictional element as a "rail."<br/><br/>However, if we limit our discussion to "fictional elements that are used to resolve or transition between events," then I think things are clearer. Any fictional element COULD be a rail, or be intended to be one, but only becomes one trough its utilization or planned use. <br/><br/>However I agree with many here that the term "rail" doesn't help everyone understand what's going on. You have to unlearn some connotations to wrap your head around that. <br/><br/>Maybe "rail" becomes "path". And when said paths are over limited and accelerated, this is when you are functionally on a railroad. <br/><br/>Also, railroad is a noun. Describes a play structure. Railroading is a verb, so it describes actions to construct a railroad. Creating any fiction at all should not be considered railroading. <br/><br/>A kitten being a rail/path, or hair color being a rail/path simply because it limits your choices isn't realistic. Anyone can later decide that the cat was a hallucination, or worse yet, completely retcon and decide none of those events happen. They can modify its fiction or completely remove it from the fiction. We might find that behavior frustrating and that feels more like what "railroading" is. An overt attempt to override the agency of others to limit paths and accelerate toward an agenda. <br/><br/>This is why it feels useful to only define paths as elements that are utilized, rather than just any element itself. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nikolai" title="Nikolai"><img alt="Nikolai" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nikolai">Nikolai</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436774/#Comment_436774" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-09T11:14:29+00:00" title="August  9, 2014 11:14AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to throw in a clear example of railroading from <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18646/techniques-do-we-have-a-list-of-them#Item_1" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> and try to explain it simply with AsIf's model.\n<blockquote><br/>I recall a battle against some kind of demon that had that monstruous AC and DR on top of it. My monk (second character and first attempt at optimization) using his best combat options could only hit it with a 20 and since I was one level away from getting the ability to surpass his DR couldn't do a scratch. So my best chance was to score a crit to make 2 hp of damage. And that always left me in his threat area on his turn, with barely 16 of AC. After his next hit barely killed me and as I watched how my companions struggled but found no way to surpass the creature's defense nor survive his attacks for long, I started to roleplay it like "we have to run while we can, this is gonna be our end!"<br/><br/>The GM asked me why I was telling that and I referred to the facts. Ruleswise, my character had no way to contribute to the battle and the rest of the party could do very little, therefore it was obvious that we had bitten more than we could chew. I was thinking "It's okay, it could happen and it could still be interesting if we run from a monster for once and find another way through. But then the GM just looked at my character sheet and handwave the whole thing telling me that "never mind, let's say your character can hit it, ok?"<br/><br/>I had almost convinced the rest of the players, this wasn't even the final boss and we were wasting resources... but then everyone thought the problem was solved, kept fignting the monster and finally defeated it. I felt cheated. I felt that the GM had pity of my character. Up until then I could accept the railroading and help keep the illusion, but now the GM had showed me that we were being railroaded even into winning whenever he wanted to. <br/></blockquote>\nSo the GM had created a very tough monster to fight for WarriorMonk's party here. WarriorMonk identified a common/implicit rail and chose to utilize it. That rail was <b> "Run like hell!" </b>which is an common/implicit rail in any situation where there is an escape route.<br/><br/>The GM is well within his reasonable role in putting a very difficult monster in this location. This is a common feature of sandbox play where the players might expect that they should come back later when they have a few more levels.<br/><br/>However, the railroading comes into play when the GM decides to invalidate WarriorMonk's decision to take the <b>Run like hell!</b> rail by bending the game mechanics and throwing out armor class.<br/><br/>The GM used force to ensure that only the <b>Defeat the monster and proceed.</b> rail was taken.<br/><br/>Does this analysis help? Does this align with how you are defining rails, AsIf?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436780/#Comment_436780" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-09T14:37:27+00:00" title="August  9, 2014  2:37PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2014 6:53AM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your time and thoughts, you (gender-nonspecific) guys!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/contracycle">@contracycle</a>, <a href="/forums/profile/Khimus">@Khimus</a> - I agree that the word "rail" gets weird in that Fiasco example.  And I like where Khimus' computer metaphor thoughts are going.  Let's consider all terms to be placeholder terms, so that the conversation may continue but we may always decide on different terms later.  Our Method is Science, our Aim is Design Theory.  <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning">@DustinDePenning</a> - True the word "path" may be better than "rail" (at least when speaking on the Scene Level), but both words imply a physical means of transit, and we must always bear in mind that such transit is not always physical (even fictionally so).  Such abstractions may manifest in different ways (or not manifest at all) on other game levels or in certain types of games.  But it is probably obvious that I chose the word "rail" for a <i>semantic</i> reason as well: to make an overarching point about "railroading", which point I consider vitally important.  This gives my use of the term a rhetorical value which <i>directly opposes old entrenched definitions and overly-ideological views.</i>  The old (Player-based) definition is non-scientific, entirely subjective, and technically useless.  Used by a Player, this word is nothing but polemic and conjecture.<br/><br/>Paul asked if my model could interpret Fiasco, so I gave it a shot, but it gets fuzzy and I'm not sure we're ready to go there yet.  I tried.  Still trying.  So I'm about to make another terminological distinction.  What if we say that...<br/><br/><b>A rail has an "Effective" aspect and an "Affective" aspect.</b>  The <i>Effective Rail</i> (i.e. the effective aspect of a rail) is the one that the Player chooses and gets on (metaphorically of course).  The <i>Affective Rail</i> (i.e. the affective aspect of a rail) is the part that constrains other players.  It might be useful to consider them as the "near end" (effective eggress) and the "far end" (affective force) of the lines in my diagram.  In a trad game, at the Scene Level, both aspects of the rail are activated and "traversed" simultaneously so it is easy to think of them both when we say "the rail".  But in other games, such as Fiasco, it helps to separate them because they terminate on different levels of abstraction.<br/><br/>When Paul says he has a kitten, <i>Effectively</i> speaking, that's not even a rail at all.  In the fictional world, it's merely color.<br/>The kitten is an <i>Affective Rail</i> in the metagame (the collab game).  This is where the meaning gets fuzzy, because we're forced to think in both games at once.  This is both exciting and daunting, from my model-making perspective.  While the kitten does impact on other players' freedom later, it doesn't <i>force</i> them to use it, nor <i>point</i> them into any particular scene.  The word "rail" is harder to get behind in this usage, unless we step up to a higher level of abstraction.  \n<ul><li> In the trad game, at the Scene Level, the Effective Rail says "YOU EXIT THIS SITUATION IN THIS WAY".  <br/>It is a positive constraint functioning as a <b>Force</b>.<br/></li><li>In the meta Fiasco game the Affective Rail says "YOU CANNOT CONTRADICT THIS FACT".  <br/>It is a negative constraint functioning as a <b>Limit</b>.</li></ul>\nSo functionally these dynamics <i>are</i> definitely different.  And since this is a functionalist model, the difference probably means that another word is needed here.  The difference is this: An Affective Rail in a trad game literally forces other players into the situation it has brought about, while the constraint of an Affective Rail in a meta (collab) Fiasco game is more like an un-crossable "safety rail" than the kind of "rail" that a train rolls along.  <br/><br/>I'm still processing this question.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436782/#Comment_436782" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-09T14:45:07+00:00" title="August  9, 2014  2:45PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Nikolai">@Nikolai</a> - Yes that's exactly how I would parse <a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk%27s">@WarriorMonk's</a> example.  <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436783/#Comment_436783" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-09T14:47:53+00:00" title="August  9, 2014  2:47PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2014 2:50PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>We might find that behavior frustrating and that feels more like what "railroading" is.

(I really want a meta-thread to discuss this thread.  I started this thread to expound on my analysis without the kind of tennismatch that might have otherwise threatened to derail your thread, and <i>it's not working!</i> :-)    Looking back through the above pages I see several motivators exposed here, and they sorta lead to each other in a purposeful sequence.  I will recap them:<br/><br/>One motivator for me is Semantic.  Ridding the world of a poorly-defined categorical, a harmful indiscretion, and a technically valueless term.  Calling someone a "railroader" (in <i>that</i> sense of the word) takes absolutely no account of their artistic intention, circumstantial context, operational scope or practical purpose.  It lumps them all together into one slandered category, ignoring all differences between them, and it even helps the sociopathic ones to hide among the artistic/experimental ones.  In short, it is blind prejudice.  Thus it's really no better than any other fascistic pejorative (where the word "fascistic" means "binding together and treating as one" in a literal sense).  Its only practical purpose is social/political, not constructive/technical, and it uses a subjective interpretation of fictional events to place categorical judgments upon real people and their artforms.  That irks the fuck out of me.<br/><br/>Then there's the Analytical goal of unpacking that term to discover what we're <i>really</i> talking about, <i>technically</i> not politically.  I decide to proceed in a scientific fashion.  I start a public project to perform a functional analysis.   Now I and my co-contributors must bring onto the table all dynamic functions which operate in similar ways or have similar effects, regardless of scope, level, originator, intentions or ethics.  We must discuss them in new ways.  We must manifest taxonomies.  We must create new terms, or new interpretations of existing terms.   We must develop a jargon, which may one day end up contributing practically to the broader jargons of game play and game design.  Who knows?  But to do these things, we must speak in ways that will make Forge-fundamentalists shriek and neophobes hold their heads in pain.  We are cutting across the grain of their entire understanding.  This cannot be helped, I am discovering.<br/><br/>That leads directly into a motivator called Progress.  As the project proceeds (but most importantly <i>after</i> this analysis is substantially completed and generally supported by all contributors to the project) we will begin building models illustrating our new understanding.  The models themselves will suggest questions that have never been asked before, which will encourage more experimentation.  In fact this is already beginning to happen.  The models in conjunction with the jargon, once relatively stable and generally supported by contributors and adherents, will allow conversation on these topics to occur with a much greater degree of specificity amongst designers.  This will spur the creation of new mechanics and game structures, which will eventually trickle down to GMs and ultimately to Players.<br/><br/>My Ultimate goal is for <i>everyone</i> to possess another way of thinking about narrative structures, another body of technique that can be used <span style="text-decoration: underline;">proactively</span> rather than <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reactively</span>, another interpretation of a word that can be used <span style="text-decoration: underline;">constructively</span> rather than <span style="text-decoration: underline;">divisively</span>, an expanded understanding of their ART that admits and supports a diverse range of design and operation methodologies without prejudice, enabling even greater variety and possibility in playing, running, and designing the games of tomorrow.\ufeff<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436791/#Comment_436791" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-09T17:16:45+00:00" title="August  9, 2014  5:16PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool, Tod.

Use of GM force, with player consent, was Illusionism, and railroading retained it's old meaning of doing so without consent.  In that respect, calling someone "a railroader" did not at all lump everything together, and could be used quite specifically.  The fact that some people remain unconvinced that p[layers can and do consent is a rather different problem, and not one resolved by trying to turn "railroading" into a universal property of play; indeed, that seems to make the waters rather muddier than clearer.  Not least becuase this had nothing nothing to do with an "interpretation of fictional events", but of the operational social contract.  Similarly, articistic intention et al. is of little significance if consent is not granted; that's no excuse, really.<br/><br/>Now, I don't particularly want to play the stick-in-the-mud here, and I'd certainlty be happy to continue a discussion of the stricture of what might be termed "content", which is where you seem to be going, to my eye.  But I'm not convinced that the effrot to rehabilitate railroading as a term is worthwhile, nor am I convinced that it's even a useful analog for what you are trying to discuss, which seems to me to perhaps have something rather more to do with "direction", in the sense of the movie use of the term.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436796/#Comment_436796" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-09T20:11:19+00:00" title="August  9, 2014  8:11PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2014 8:11PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>(Yes, I'm on the same page; <a href="/forums/profile/contracycle">@contracycle</a> nails it as far as I'm concerned.

But, as contracycle says, the *worrisome* part of all this is the implication that "artistic intent" overrides consent. It's bizarre to say that a term which means "some of the people involved were unhappy with how it went and felt powerless" is "subjective" and "blind prejudice". Clearly they didn't have a good time, and I see no rightful reason to ignore that.)</i><br/><br/>In terms of useful definitions and developing this theoretical framework, though, one really key missing point is the issue of Creative Agenda (whether we wish to use Forge terms for it or not; we could call it something else if we want). To my mind, that's the most important consideration when it comes to creative control over a game and its content, right after consent. It cuts straight through all the ideological banter and allows us to practically look at whether a certain form of control/force is contributing to a game or ruining it. <br/><br/>I don't know if it's too early to work that in just now, but I hope it will be addressed eventually, since it is (to my eye) a key feature of this kind of discussion. (And particularly so if we're looking at something like "railroading" as a creative function, or an element of a game's design.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

When you go to see a movie or pick up a book, you generally have SOME idea of what kind of experience you're in for.  And after their first session, my regular players do, too.<br/><br/>I can think of edge cases even for movies and books - like wanting to see something surprising and scary but not knowing exactly how surprising and scary it will be, yet still not wanting it "spoiled".  However, again, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436811/#Comment_436811" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T00:05:13+00:00" title="August 10, 2014 12:05AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2014 12:35AM by 2097.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><br/>Using illusionism and other force techniques is a way to get around the expectations set by the game system itself and take away player agency.<br/></blockquote>\nNo, it is NOT.<br/><br/>Neither is the idea of GM "intrusions" in any way helpful.  If the social contract is agreed to by all parties, then this is a form of willingly delegated authority, not an "intrusion" at all.</blockquote>\nWhere did that \u201cif\u201d come from? <em>I was talking about violations of the social contract.</em>\n<blockquote>Why do you have such difficulty even imagining that people might want to play in this sort of game, might choose to do so, might be getting precisely what they want from it?  Just because you don't?</blockquote>\nBecause I have seen time and again players landing in such games <em>without choosing so</em>.<br/>Even yesterday I was playing in a game where it felt like the player agency was too low and that we were on rails. I haven\u2019t seen the scenario write-up and it\u2019s possible that it was just a weird conflux of our choices and the situation that caused that feeling.<br/>I signed up for a D&amp;D game and that can apparently mean very different things.\n<blockquote>Look, it's common to think of this in terms of the GM "imposing their story" (even if I this is sort of the wrong concept).  But even if that's so, why on earth do you think the GM is going to go out of the way to give the players, their audience, a story they aren't going to like?  That this notional GM refuses point blank to be cognizant of the players desires, refuses to cater to them.  Would you think that of any other kind pof performer, like an author or a film director, that they are actively hostiler to their audience?  That this GM is so narcissistic as to thoughtlessly impose their personal vision, but not quite narcissistic enough to care what anyone thinks of what they produce?</blockquote>\nBecause I don\u2019t want a GM as an author, film director or performer. I want them to run <em>a place</em> and the inhabitants therein.<br/>If I am playing a game for the purposes of story, I\u2019d go to a GM-less story game.<br/>If I trust a DM or GM to run a game, I want to play a game and be exploring in it.\n<blockquote>The concept is absurd, completely crazy, utterly, implausibly, nuts.  It's so ridiculous it shouldn't even be up for discussion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><blockquote><br/>It's not that complicated: the GM thinks that he or she knows what the players like better than they do. This is a very basic human temptation we all fall prey to in all aspects of our lives; it's hardly shocking. When the GM is given the power to "impose their story", they often forget about the players' desires altogether and force their vision down everyone's throats. This is what Tod (AsIf) has been calling "artless railroading", and it's clearly a very real thing that many or most of us have observed "in the wild" on repeated occasions.<br/></blockquote>\nNot that's not the same.  Knowingly violating the social contract is not "artless" or clumsy, it's a great deal worse, and much more deliberate.  2097 did NOT criticise railroading while allowing for Illusionism to be legitimate, illusionism was specifically included.</blockquote>\nWhat I did criticise was when illusionism is used to do exactly that \u2014 violate the social contract. \u201cKnowingly\u201d is hard to tell since there\u2019s so seldomly a discussion of expectations.\n<blockquote>I'm sick to fucking death of this bullshit.<br/><br/>I've expended a great deal of time and effort in finding out what the players want, in working with them, in making it quite clear what is going on, earning both their trust and their buy-in. I'm setting expectations, not getting around them; I'm enhancing player agency, not taking it away.  And I'm thoroughly fed up with being told, contrary to the facts, what I'm "really" doing, and being judged by the standard of some fucking loser-GM that you may have encountered or heard about.</blockquote>\nI\u2019m fed up with this jokey talk about insanity and being \u201cnuts\u201d and I\u2019m also fed up with sloppy pro-illusionism talk enabling these contract-violating GMs (be they \u201cfucking losers\u201d or not) that I run into every way I turn in the RPG-community.<br/><br/>There is a reason why we say \u201cbe crystal clear about that social contract or expectations before touching illusionism and some of the other force techniques\u201d.<br/>Because it\u2019s not that it happens once in a blue moon. It\u2019s because I hear to death that you\u2019re not a good DM if you <em>don\u2019t</em> fudge and use illusionism to \u201cget the story to where you want\u201d.<br/><br/>My original claim was (re-stated):<br/>Illusionism is used contrary to player expectations to take away player agency.<br/><br/>If I add an \u201coften\u201d in there, or even a \u201cusually\u201d or \u201calmost always\u201d, it can stand up to your claim of<br/>\u201cIllusionism can be used in accordance with player expectations to enhance player agency\u201d<br/><br/><br/><em>If what you are doing is in accordance with the expectations of the group \u2014 the social contract</em>, then of course it\u2019s OK and that\u2019s not what I\u2019ve been arguing against.<br/><br/>So this is what I\u2019m saying:<br/><br/>1.<br/><em>Not talking about your group, but:</em><br/>Often the social contract is so implicit and unstated that the GM and the players have completely different views on what they\u2019re doing.<br/>Often fudging and illusionism violate the players\u2019 view of the social contract.<br/>That style which you\u2019ve named \u201closer GMs\u201d and \u201ca great deal worse than artless or clumsy\u201d is very common, almost normative. <em>Because of that</em> I think talk about establishing social contract goes hand in hand with talk advocating illusionism. If it weren\u2019t so close to almost becoming \u201cthis is how you play RPGs\u201d in some communities, you\u2019d have a case that it was a straw man. But it\u2019s reality.<br/><br/>2.<br/>I, for many reasons, do not like and do not wish to enter the particular social contract that I infer from what you have been posting about your group in this thread, nor the particular one that I infer from what AsIf has been posting about in this thread, and I have argued against such a social contract.<br/><em>If your players</em> are onboard with that social contract <em>then of course you are not violating expectations</em> and it\u2019s a straw man to say that I was saying that.\n<blockquote>Everyone, or almost everyone, has heard of Maradonna's "Hand of God" goal, and yet I don't see this well known instance of cheating being used to claim that all of football is cheating, or that anyone who plays it is a cheat.

And what was I subjected to, from my supposedly football-fan friend in the room? Nothing but a long rant on cheating \u2014 including mention of the Hand of God, but also faking injuries and whether or not the judges should start using cameras and how all of the tournament was meaningless because of cheating etc etc etc. So for all my brief encounters with football, it\u2019s always rants against the sport, against FIFA, against current judging methods and above all else, rants against cheating.<br/>But this isn\u2019t a football defense thread.<br/><br/>ETD:<br/>I originally had a lot of \u201cfucking\u201d because I was angry even before contracycle\u2019s posts and I got angrier still at them.

There's nothing wrong with the widely-understood definition of railroading, which is having a choice you made in good faith invalidated by someone else at the table in a manner that supersedes the game rules. Nor is there anything particularly subjective about this meaning, because people reasonably expect different types of agency in different games, as I explained awhile ago. Whereas if everything is railroading, then nothing is.<br/><br/>I also see you engaging in classic derailing (hah!) tactics used in discussions where marginalized folks speak up about their experiences: accusing them of being overly subjective and ideologically motivated, when what they want is simply not to be mistreated. <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> is 100% right about real-world RPG culture: I simply have no expectations of fairness or clarity of expectations whatsoever when I play with a GM I don't already know, because &lt;i&gt;even asking about how the rules of a game <i>actually work</i> is usually considered a serious social faux pas.

I don't think you're arguing that there's one true way to run games. I just think you've got delusions of grandeur. Splicing up every single moment of play into "rails"? Talking about "fractals"? Please. Give me a break. The RPG medium <i>is</i> complex, sure, but the narrative structural aspects of that complexity are well-covered by existing tabletop and LARP theory. Furthermore, the way to find new narrative structures is simply to experiment with different designs, not to redefine well-understood terms and then trying to steamroll people into staying quiet about their real, negative experiences. (All the interesting theories, including orthodox Forge theory, <i>follow</i> design, or at least accompany design. Look at Clouds-and-Boxes, for example, which [IIRC] came out of examining the ways IaWA tends to break down.)<br/><br/>The hard part is the <i>social</i> stuff; it's the part that most routinely breaks down, it's the part that actually matters, and it's the part that your theories do nothing to address. The RPG landscape is littered with pompous dreams of redefining the narrative experience of the players\u2014but they are nothing more than soap bubbles to be popped upon meeting actual people who are actually trying to play and have fun. You use language more articulately than most, but your ideas are just as devoid of the possibility of real-world impact.<br/><br/>I'm out of this thread, and I won't respond to messages from you on this topic either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436835/#Comment_436835" name="Item_159" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T10:57:06+00:00" title="August 10, 2014 10:57AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, I'm going to reread that post once in a while.  <br/>I think there's a reversal happening on the word "marginalized" but other than that, I'll take it at face value.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436846/#Comment_436846" name="Item_160" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T13:13:26+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  1:13PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I prefer the word Rails to Paths, Options or Constrain. Yes, it's loaded with some significant physicality but it also helps identificate that what we're looking for is a <b>sequence of justifications</b> to pass from one scene framing into another, in order to make the story progress through the fictional time and space.<br/><br/>It also helps me see an unpacked meaning. Railroading now becomes the act of manipulating the Rails. I choose to separate the ethics of this since it's like any other human tool. A hammer can be used to built a school or to kill a student, and the responsability of the act falls on the wielder and not on the object.<br/><br/>Larp offers a better term for the explicit case when one player negates another player's input, it's called Blocking. Which again, it isn't exactly a bad practice per se, but an indicative that there's a difference of opinions on where to take the creative agenda or how.<br/><br/>The real problem with these tools starts when players:<br/><br/>1) Assume a tacit agreement on a really important game issue (who is in charge of the creative agenda, when and how) instead of clarifying this while explaining the rules before getting to play. This is also an incredibly common designer's mistake. Some think they can get away with adding a few "best game practices" reccomendations, but actual Rules have better effect into making people pay more attention to this important subject. I mean, look at all our APs, people get really hurt by this and designers are still doing too little no nothing to help put an end to it. AW's Principles are a good start, but there's still a lot to be said and done in the Rules department about this.<br/><br/>2) Manipulate rails in a bad and/or notorious fashion. That tells everyone that the player/GM has a hidden agenda, which is a valid motive to distrust that person if that's perceived as a rupture of the social contract. Especially if the social contract is based in the Designer's description of the game as "a game where everyone plays a character in a world narrated by the GM and together, they create a story". This is the worst lie ever, and something that everyone interpretates to their convenience. Yes, it suffices to make everyone buy the idea of roleplaying and describes accurately the game and the consequences of play, but omits all the important steps that help us turn it into a enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>3) Have ulterior non-artistic motives behind that railroading. Which is what happens most often. It can be the work of someone going after group recognition, driven by the need to satisfy their ego or to please some of the other participans, mixed with a low social sensitivity to recognize signs of frustration, embarrasement, discomfort and also a measure of intolerance and/or lack of adaptability towards other player's creative input. It becames even worse when people with these motives can't honestly acknowledge them to let the group adapt or decline to keep playing and/or instead acusses the rest of players as the instigators of the problem (who, by the way, may also have ulterior motives)<br/><br/>Now, does everyone see how packed is the word Railroading? There's even more behind it and we have a lot to gain from analyzing all the contents. We're bound for finding a suitable way to play different games, maybe create new ones and make the roleplaying experience more enjoyable for everyone by having a deeper understanding on what we don't really like, what can be of use, what can we live with and how to better avoid those things we hate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436849/#Comment_436849" name="Item_161" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T13:23:03+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  1:23PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you <a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a>.

Fiasco is problably more related to the definition of trad games given above than all of trad games. Players have the control of a character, the control of the world is more or less property of everyone and the randomization of the game is meant to give inspiration material. The game has probably only two rails, both stated in the rules: 1- things are going to end bad for everyone (and that's the fun of it) and 2- The Tilt. No matter how well you try to protect your character in the fiction, the Tilt will affect the whole fictional world in an irreversible way. Both rails are so wide and/or random that never feel like too much of a constrain once everyone gets them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436852/#Comment_436852" name="Item_163" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T13:30:06+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  1:30PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're welcome.\n<blockquote><br/>PS - Blocking is its own thing which can be discussed too, but FYI in activist circles that word has a very charged meaning.

But enough about that.<br/><br/>This thread has led me to think about railroading (in this case, meaning tight GM control over the storyline in a way which is not negotiated with the group).<br/><br/>There are three reasons/rationales I can see for the use of that technique. I'm going to list them here, perhaps that will help the discussion along. I'd also be curious to hear if there are other rationales not covered by these three categories.<br/><br/>1. It's seen as an 'easy way out'. This was probably reinforced (or even created?) by early module-writers who were trying to "tell stories", as can be seen in a lot of, e.g. early 90's published adventures. (It's entirely possible that many of these writers never played any games, as well - I've heard several such admissions on the internet, at least some of them might be true.)<br/><br/>Explaining how to do something open-ended and interactive is simply more complex than writing a linear story. It's easy for a designer or module-writer (or a GM preparing an adventure) to assume a linear story and prepare that. <br/><br/>Similarly for a GM in the middle of a game: it might be easier to just use the powers granted by the GM-seat to roll ahead at the players' expense than to try to create open-ended situations (or whatever else the game normally calls for). Less effort, less thinking involved - it's late and you're tired and the game has to wrap up in an hour.<br/><br/>Simply enough: it's easier. (Or at least seen as being easier.)<br/><br/>2. Playing a "railroaded" or linear story means that you know what will happen in advance. <br/><br/>This means that a creative individual can use all kinds of storytelling tools to craft a certain experience. Props and tools, like maps and miniatures and handouts and NPC portraits. A careful setup for future events, like foreshadowing, thematic coherence, dramatic coincidences, and so forth. Simply taking the time to craft elements (e.g. NPCs, prophecies, locales, even game rules like "custom moves") in advance might be a huge boon to someone who isn't creative enough (or confident enough) to come up with those things "on the spot". Statting up a monster or opponent in a highly-complex system is another example (if you can't do it on the fly, you need some other solution).<br/><br/>The idea here is that the GM gives herself extra time to prepare more carefully, and then makes sure that the preparation isn't wasted. This, in theory, allows a higher creative/artistic level to be reached in play. <br/><br/>Maybe you can play out a game where you have a mask you can put on for each of the characters the PCs meet, for example. A lot of people would find that cool.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best example I can think of is the "4 out of 7 cried" thread we had here on Story Games, as well as some of TomasHMV's accounts of his games. (I've never participated in a fun/successful/functional game like this myself, however. And I do note that all the examples I'm referring to were *consensual*, not hidden or disguised. May be a coincidence, of course.)<br/><br/>3. The GM is, not to mince words, a *better roleplayer* than the players in the game. Her input is *better*.<br/><br/>I suspect this is often a hidden feature/motivation behind railroading practices: the GM, simply, considers herself to have better ideas/better taste than the players, and therefore it is desirable to give precedence to her view and/or artistry over the other players.<br/><br/>In this case the idea is that the GM takes charge of the gaming group and the fictional events as they unfold, so that the entire group may benefit from her brilliance. Giving precedence to the "best" player at the table gives the group leadership and allows the game to reach a higher artistic level than it would if everyone were contributing equally: the group is raised up to a higher level and their game is better this way than if they defaulted to the "lowest common denominator".<br/><br/>This has a dark side - megalomaniac GMs, people who do this without consent, and so forth, which we've discussed to death - but it also has a positive or constructive side. I could see that being the case with an adult running a game for a group of young children, for example. Another example is someone teaching a game to a group for the first time, or any experienced gamer playing with a group of people who are beginners, shy, or unsure of themselves. <br/><br/>The person with better skills or more experience improves the game by contributing to it more than the other people playing.<br/><br/>This is already the case in most typical GMed RPGs - in most social contracts, the GM has more input into the game (choosing the system being played, to go back further to before the game even begins, for example) than the players do, and this is often seen as a positive. It can also be the case in collaborative games, like someone who "facilitates" a session of Fiasco.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>These three rationales all have different levels of potential problems, and at least I, having seen bad examples of all three, cringe a little when considering them. In every case, the tradeoff is individual choice and free will. (For me, this becomes a bit of a social/political/philosophical issue, where I'd rather preserve individual freedoms and teach players and GMs how to be better, rather than adopt a totalitarian or dictatorial hierarchy in a hobby which is primarily a social activity.) <br/><br/>However, as the "4 out of 7 cried" thread demonstrates, there are definitely times when each of these techniques is just the thing, and a group or designer/writer who desires it or needs it. (For instance, for a short game with strangers, like D&amp;D's 1-hr "Encounters" or other game demos, most of us have no complaints about using pre-gen characters. In a similar fashion, arguments could be made for limited fictional options as a player in such a game. We accept limited choice in a Choose Your Own Adventure book as an inherent limitation of the medium, as well.)<br/><br/>I'd like to end with a question:<br/><br/>In my mind, and in my experience, none of these situations in any way require illusion or non-consent. I can't see any reason not to be above-board about what's happening and why, either in the game or module design, or in GM techniques. I always want to know what we're playing and how and why. If I'm at your gaming table, don't lie to me.<br/><br/>(Perhaps this is why Tod's discourse on the topic of railroading occasionally worries me: "If it's done well, you'll never notice!" That's a scary thought to me, not an appealing one.)<br/><br/>However, I know that some people actually *enjoy* the whole smoke-and-mirrors, magician's-trick school of roleplaying games. "Oh, my! That all turned out just as planned! How did he DO that?" "I don't want to know!"<br/><br/>(If you need an example, consider the typical D&amp;D combat where the monster has an unlimited number of hit points, and then is declared dead by the GM at the moment that seems most dramatic, or after the players "have fought hard enough". This is a perfect example of this kind of technique, and the type of thing that players occasionally say they don't want to know about.)<br/><br/>EDIT - Here's another good example from a different thread:\n<blockquote><br/>We may tend to think of these boundaries as being a defensive line for the GM's purposes ("plot" the typical jewel being protected).  But some boundaries might be placed to prevent the PCs from getting into trouble they're not ready to handle yet.  "Don't confront the Boss before you get the sword" kinda thing.  Not because of pacing or plot <i>really,</i> but simply because the GM knows that if they face that guy now, they're dead.<br/></blockquote>\nIf you're one of those people, what's the appeal for you? What leads you to enjoy this kind of game, and what turns you off? What are the perks and what are the drawbacks?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436884/#Comment_436884" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T15:07:58+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  3:07PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2014 3:49PM by Rickard.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yes, it's loaded with some significant physicality but it also helps identificate that what we're looking for is a <b>sequence of justifications</b> to pass from one scene framing into another, in order to make the story progress through the fictional time and space.<br/><br/>It also helps me see an unpacked meaning.

In this case, both the players and the GM share an interest in evoking the source material, but that doesn't happen automatcially.  Frex, one of SW's recurring themes is planets with a single ecosystme - the ice planet, the desert planet, etc.  It's not enough to include thesenin the setting, to really recreate the feel of the movies you also need to get the players down onto them, which can be tricky when one of the other desirable themes is the "tramp freighter" trope.<br/><br/>The point of all this is that when this is done right - and it, should go without saying, with consent - the resulting play is thematically more like the source material, and everyone is happier for it.  Indeed, from the players' perspective, it's the whole point in granting the GM authority.<br/><br/>As I've mentioned before the assumption often seems to be that GM authoroty is, or will be, used primarily for the satisfaction of the the GM;s ego; however I think a far more realistic approach is to see it being exercised to give the players what they all want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436899/#Comment_436899" name="Item_173" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T18:40:44+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  6:40PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            contracycle,<br/><br/>I'm with you, but there's something I don't entirely understand about this argument. If there's something the players all want (e.g. getting down onto the desert moon at least once a session), why is some kind of railroading necessary? Why can't we just have the players (as well as the GM, of course) contrive to make sure the characters end up there? What's the advantage in putting it in the GM's hands?<br/><br/>Or, even more robustly, we can work into the game's design.<br/><br/>This does remind me, though, that I did come up with another reason in my other thread:\n<blockquote>One thing I think about myself sometimes (but haven't seen in action) is using GM force - railroading - in order to reinforce a certain theme.<br/><br/>For example, I can imagine some kind of dystopian future where machines control our fate (or a game which questions the existence of free will, or a game in which a certain outcome is fated, like an Oedipus Rex RPG). In that game, it might be effective to use railroading techniques to make the player feel some of the hopelessness of the character.<br/><br/>I don't know if I'd enjoy such a game as anything more than a one-shot or one-time experience, but the thematic connection there is interesting (from a design perspective, at least).</blockquote>\nAs another poster commented, <i>Paranoia</i> is one commercial example of such a game.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_436902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436902/#Comment_436902" name="Item_174" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T19:32:03+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  7:32PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The advantage is verismilitude.

For players who are invested in the idea of Exploration, who desire to experience the fictional world on the same footing as their characters, without obvious Deus Ex Machina, who want the experience to be as seamless as possible, then stepping out of their character's head-speace to actively connive with the GM to produce some specific result is not an ideal solution.

Fiasco is problably more related to the definition of trad games given above than all of trad games. Players have the control of a character, the control of the world is more or less property of everyone and the randomization of the game is meant to give inspiration material. The game has probably only two rails, both stated in the rules: 1- things are going to end bad for everyone (and that's the fun of it) and 2- The Tilt. No matter how well you try to protect your character in the fiction, the Tilt will affect the whole fictional world in an irreversible way. Both rails are so wide and/or random that never feel like too much of a constrain once everyone gets them.</blockquote>\nFirst, the rules do NOT say that it will end bad for everyone - in fact, Fiasco can end well for everyone!<br/><br/>Consider a four player group of FIasco. In each Act, there's eight scenes. If in the first Act everyone diligently makes sure that each player either gets 2 black dice or 2 white dice (this is easy because giving someone the outcome die is not connected to the fiction), and in the second Act, everyone that has 2 black dice always chooses to resolve the scene and always resolves the scene badly for their character, and everyone that has two white dice always chooses to resolve the scene and always resolves the scene positively for their character, then at the end of the game everyone will be rolling four white dice or four black dice and the worst you can get with that is Bitter, and on average you will get the very best outcome possible.  The chance that you'll get one of the top two outcomes is slightly over 90 percent. There's a two in three chance that everyone in the entire group will get one of the top two best possible outcomes.<br/><br/>Second, isn't the selection of a white or black outcome die for someone who chooses not to resolve things for their character "railroading" under the ultra-extreme definition being propounded here? After all, you don't have a choice whether things come out good or bad for you. Literally no matter what you do in the scene, and literally no matter what the scene is (after all, you get to set the scene, too!), someone else gets to arbitrarily select an outcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436904/#Comment_436904" name="Item_176" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T19:48:00+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  7:48PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            contracycle,<br/><br/>That's interesting, but I'm having trouble imagining what it looks like in actual play.<br/><br/>My experience has been that when something is fundamental to the type of game or story we're trying to tell, we all collaborate to make that happen. For instance, if we're playing a bunch of people who go into dungeons and steal stuff, then we might discuss a little before the game what kinds of characters are suitable and which are not, and then decide on character types appropriately. If we DO decide that there will be a "reluctant" character, then we all understand that a) the character will need to be prodded into action, by GM or players, or both, and b) when there will be reasons given for him to go underground, he might *pretend* not to want to go, but the player will, in fact, eagerly jump on the excuse to go on the adventure.<br/><br/>What does it look like when the player is actually not aware that he's collaborating in this context? Can you give me an example from an actual game?<br/><br/>This might be a new way to look at this topic for me, so I'm quite curious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_436918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436918/#Comment_436918" name="Item_177" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T21:43:35+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  9:43PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did not say that the players would never collaborate, or never be aware of collaborating; I said that the players would not do so <i>overtly</i>.  So I don't think it would look much different; the character's reluctance would be an affectation, a piece of "character acting" if you like, and as you say, after some pro-forma effort, the player will allow the PC to be "persuaded" or whatever.  What I'm saying is that precisely because we DO all understand this, it will not be discussed OOC.  The GM might proffer some hook, but in the confidence that the player will bite.  As long as this all occurs without explicitly intruding into the fiction, all is well.<br/><br/>The point, though, is that the effort to keep everything behind the scenes is valuable.  It's not like some games in which the discussion is overt, between the players, and certainly not like like games where currency is employed directly in a person-to-person mode.  There is a big difference between "we all agree the next scene will take place on the desert moon of X", and the GM saying "Your quarry is fleeing to the desert moon of X" (this is of course a very crude example).<br/><br/>And even if the GM had to use a bit of covert force to ensure that said quarry did get away on first encounter, so that they could flee to the desert moon of X, thus forcing the players to follow, they aren't going to be concerned by that, because it means they get to go to the kind of place they do after all want to go.

Let's go see a show together on Monday, yeah?" - and a timid culture where things aren't stated explicitly: "Um, so you have Mondays off, you say? That must be nice. I wish I had Mondays off, too. I heard there's a pretty cool show on Mondays on Coronation Street. Funny, that reminds me: I actually will get a Monday off next week." (Expectant stare.)<br/><br/>Everyone's on board with the process (which is essentially exactly the same), there's just a bit of social taboo around talking about it overtly.<br/><br/>Does that sound about right? The two games we're describing are identical functionally - the players are just communicating less directly.<br/><br/>ETA: Or is this actually different? A game where the players are being directed this way, and they *do not realize it*? In other words, do you believe the game is better this way (for players who enjoy it, of course) just because the players <i>don't say that's how it works out loud</i>, or is it actually the case that they don't even know it's going on at all?<br/><br/>I find the latter has slightly disturbing implications (partially because it's very hard to prove in any way that someone enjoys something more than another thing when they can't tell the difference), but if you have seen some evidence that people enjoy that more, I'll take your word for it!

I mentioned earlier in my analysis of Fiasco via the Rails Model that it's one interesting aspect of the game: that another Player at that point can "push you" onto a rail.  <br/><br/>What I missed before was that this happens in two ways, actually, because of the two games:<br/>(1) By Resolving the scene they put your character on an Effective Rail, which ends the scene inside the RP game.  <br/>(2) By giving you the die they establish an Affective Rail in the collab game that doesn't affect you until the aftermath.  <br/>We might call that second one a Delayed Rail, or a Time-Release Rail.  <br/><br/><i>BTW seen in light of 2097's thread I think my term "Effective Rail" corresponds to "rail" meaning <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> (i.e., a strictly drawn path of transit out of a node or between two nodes), while my term "Affective Rail" seems closer to "rail" meaning <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> (i.e., a content constraint or heuristic boundary to an otherwise-free narrative space, i.e. more like a "railing").</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_436926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436926/#Comment_436926" name="Item_180" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T22:41:57+00:00" title="August 10, 2014 10:41PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, do you want to take that over to the other thread?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436927/#Comment_436927" name="Item_181" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T22:59:10+00:00" title="August 10, 2014 10:59PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not against that.

If a player shows up expecting collaborative storytelling, then you got a dysfunctional play. So never blame the playstyle, it's the collision of playstyles that is wrong. </blockquote>\nA moment after I posted that, I began (in my usual habit) to question it. I would like to explore the possibilities to make a game where it's OK to have different playstyles. Not in a Robin D Laws kind of way, where the game master throws in bones to engage different players. No, what I had in mind was a game where the player picks a role\u2014a role, like world creator, NPC personifier, plot maker, et c.\u2014where it feels different to play it. It contributes to it's own way to the session, and the player benefits from it on it's own terms. It doesn't have to be weird(?) like the suggestions I gave. Think of choosing a class. The player for the wizard is getting a strategic and diceless play. The rouge is all about risktaking and chance. The cleric is weaving stories about it's own life. <br/><br/>Can we do this with help of rails? I think my thoughts are a combination of:\n<blockquote>What if we make the rules different on different fractal levels?<br/>What if we play with who gets to create rails?<br/>and a new question<br/>Can the game designer control which rails that are created at certain times during the session?</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437008/#Comment_437008" name="Item_183" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T07:04:14+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  7:04AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.

We have decades of a "mainstream" play culture which tells us repeatedly (c.f. rulebooks, adverts, scenario design, GMing practice) that railroading practices are good GM technique while also pitching roleplaying as an act of "collaborative storytelling" where "you can do anything you want", limited only by your imagination. <br/><br/>This, alone, wouldn't be so bad if there wasn't ALSO a tradition/habit/culture of GMs hiding the way they run games and trying to present the hobby in the same light, while finding surreptitious ways to "rig" the game towards the desired outcome and/or storyline.<br/><br/>It's a nasty combination. A long-term dysfunctional attitude and approach to the whole game/book/GM/player relationship. No wonder people are upset. And we've almost all had some bad experiences along those lines (on either side of the GM screen - for every disgruntled player who bemoans her lack of freedom, there's a GM who doesn't understand why their use of the techniques explained in their rulebook or by their mentor GM is met with hostility by the players, and feels helpless to fix the situation).<br/><br/>What that means for this thread, though, is highly positive: we should encourage any method or approach for people to develop these playstyles further, elucidate them, and learn to present them in a way which is *not* misleading. The efforts we're seeing (like this thread) are a net positive in this sense: a necessary and useful step to better gaming for everyone. Clarity is key here, much needed, and very welcome.<br/><br/><br/><i>(I should note that all my negative comments earlier in this thread were reactions to a lack of clarity, not meant to speak negatively of the aim of this kind of effort *in any general sense*.

The actual term 'railroading', when taken literally, carries no normative judgment. It means merely "to press (someone) into doing something by rushing or coercing them". That's not always going to be a bad thing though, depending on circumstances, it could be. The problem that arises is not what the term literally means, but how it's come to be used.<br/><br/>At some point in gaming history someone used the term 'railroading' to describe something negative, or at least counter to wishes. Maybe it was a justified pejorative and maybe it wasn't, but the term stuck and came into wider use. <br/><br/>Over time people started expanding the term to apply to other situations. The reason for this is probably a disconnect between the type of game they wanted to play and the types of games they were being offered, or maybe it was merely a lack of understanding or communication or skill. Regardless, this wider application caused no end of conflict and now the term acts as a plague carrier, poisoning entire playstyles.<br/><br/>For this reason I think there's great value in analyzing and defining the word, and possibly introducing more accurate terminology into our regular vocabulary. Probably the first step is to separate out all the related, but different, aspects.<br/><br/>First, we have to deal with the denotation of non-consensual force (coercing) because this one word doesn't have any way to account for social contracts, or inherent system aspects. After all if someone is ok with being so Railroaded (or if a system or environment fundamentally requires it) then any negative connotation of the term evaporates. Metaphorically I like the Ticketed vs. Unticketed Railroading offered previously. This obviously needs to be established through full disclosure and agreement up front.<br/><br/>Second, we split the word between issues of choice and issues of layout/narrative preparation. I believe in its original usage the term was meant to negatively apply to the removal of the value of player choice. If we stick with clarification of ticket status, then there is no reason not to continue to use railroading to refer to this. Ticketed Railroading is neutral, referring to people agreeing to have the impact of their choices limited by a GM or rule system, and Unticketed Railroading is negative, referring to the removal of the impact value of player choice without their consent.<br/><br/>This only works if we adhere to not using the term railroading at all to refer to linear campaign/module layouts, nor to SESE (single-entry single-exit) narrative constructs. Many people incorrectly equate these design and administrative elements with removal of player choice. This is the Railroad vs Sandbox false dichotomy akin to asking which you prefer: the number 6 or the color blue. Whatever terms we apply to these issues it's important to see that they do not directly relate to player choice in the same way as Railroading. <br/><br/>If we can convince the majority of people to adhere to such limitations it would go a long way to fostering meaningful conversation - such as techniques to improve Ticketed Railroading, or methods to buy/sell the tickets in the first place.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440137/#Comment_440137" name="Item_196" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-16T03:23:31+00:00" title="November 16, 2014  3:23AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2014 3:51AM by AsIf.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some interesting observations, <a href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">@phoenix182</a>.  Personally I'm not that interested in convincing the majority of anyone to do anything regarding linguistic justice or whatever, but I support any attempts to do so.  Me, I'm interested in the structure, context, and potential applications of the dynamics and design goals at play <i>within</i> things that some people might call "railroading" in a pejorative sense.  Because there is more than one simple thing going on here, and a "one size fits all" word (no matter how well-known) is not going to cut the mustard.<br/><br/>For me as well as for Hindmarch, the first level of distinction is separating the noun from the verb, the rail from the roading.  So (see OP) the primary purpose of this conversation is technical, exploratory and analytical, not social, linguistic, or normative.  <br/><br/>Some people plant seeds in others' minds.  I respect that, and I wouldn't mind seeing the pejorative kneejerk fall by the wayside, but that's not really what I'm focusing on here.  I'm more interested in doing organic chemistry on the molecular components of the seeds themselves: Breaking them down, diagramming their structures, considering different contexts and fractal levels for them, recombining them with other elements, synthesizing them, and discovering other applications for them.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440138/#Comment_440138" name="Item_197" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-16T04:40:17+00:00" title="November 16, 2014  4:40AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one of the most interesting topics here is a technical one.<br/><br/>If we're to go momentarily with the Ticketed/Unticketed metaphor*, the fascinating and practical question at play is this:<br/><br/>* How does one (what techniques, procedures, etc) transition from Unticketed to Ticketed (to expose the structure of play and get player buy-in) or vice-versa (to create more seamless, experiential play)? <br/><br/>What are techniques involved, where are some applicable more than others, and so forth.

You want to talk about basically-viable techniques, in fine detail, avoiding judgement about what any given poster likes, or thinks is ethical, or is good for the hobby. You want to build up a set of concepts, and an associated language, for talking about these things. Right?<br/><br/>It probably helps that I'm reading this thread now, from the start, with all the edits to the early posts in place. It sounds like the original versions of these posts were very confusing, given the history of discussions of these issues.\n<blockquote>[Unfortunately there is a] a tradition/habit/culture of GMs hiding the way they run games and trying to present the hobby [as an act of "collaborative storytelling" where "you can do anything you want"], while finding surreptitious ways to "rig" the game towards the desired outcome and/or storyline.<br/><br/>It's a nasty combination. A long-term dysfunctional attitude and approach to the whole game/book/GM/player relationship. No wonder people are upset. </blockquote>\nNow, here's the major problem for me and for many people - any discussion of "railroading" brings up the spectre of GMs lying to us as players, or getting offended and difficult when we ask perfectly reasonable questions, and of people blithely advising other GMs to lie to their players. (Indeed, look at this recent post here were a guy on a UK roleplaying forum advise a novice convention GM <i>not</i> to be honest about his prep methods <a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=18217&amp;start=15#p192293" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=18217&amp;start=15#p192293</a> ---  <i>"First rule of making it up as you go along - don't tell ANYONE you're making it up as you go along."</i>)<br/><br/>This spectre sets off a lot of emotion in a lot of us, and we instinctively react with anger and hostility. Watch me do it just a few posts above <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>You can think of this feeling/reaction as a neurosis... but I'd ask you not to trivialise it because of that <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> . For many of this, this is the teetering edge between a hobby we love (our favourite hobby, the thing we like to do and think about most when we have the option, a thing that's deeply important to our lives) and hobby we hate (something that we really find unpleasant and weird, something we don't want to introduce our other friends to, something that we'd rather avoid and just watch a film instead. On our own. In the cold and the dark and while a dog is barking loudly in the next room. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ).<br/><br/>The Forge, in large part, gained its adherents because of this feeling - the mutual recognition that there were many of us who felt this way. And although Storygames <i>has never been, is not currently, and will never be</i> the Forge, that's where it has its communal roots. Lots of us on Storygames have those attitudes - in large part, that's why we're "here" and not somewhere else.<br/><br/>So, this kind of thread has a practical problem - any discussion of these techniques automatically invokes this emotional fog. Especially here.\n<blockquote>What that means for this thread, though, is highly positive: we should encourage any method or approach for people to develop these playstyles further, elucidate them, and learn to present them in a way which is *not* misleading. The efforts we're seeing (like this thread) are a net positive in this sense: a necessary and useful step to better gaming for everyone.</blockquote>\nYeah, I can get behind that. Lots of the elements Tod is trying to recognise and define are unavoidable in any kind of GM'd game. We could all benefit from a better understanding of their behaviour and a clearer way to talk about them. Indeed, we might be able to tease out a set of concepts that are equally instructive for GMless games (like the discussion of Fiasco in this thread).<br/><br/><b>So,</b> what I would suggest, at this juncture, is that we <i>do</i> listen to David Berg, Contracycle, Deliverator and 2097 and give up on the term "railroading" and even the similar terms like "rail". They're just too emotive to allow clarity; using the them neutrally or positively makes it just too likely that any given reader will pigeon-hole you as an apologist for behaviour that they hate. (Worse, for behaviour that they think is morally wrong)<br/><br/>I also agree with Deliverator here <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/436833/#Comment_436833" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/436833/#Comment_436833</a> to a large degree --- when you redefine terms like "railroading" that people use to label things they hate, things that are unpleasant for them, using neutral or even positive terms, they naturally feel like you're trying to dismiss their heartfelt concerns. Indeed, they (rightly) suspect that your neutral or positive use will make outsiders care less about their concerns. You can respect these people by leaving their terms alone and creating new ones.<br/><br/>(Hindmarch's article does some fun things with the railroad metaphor, but on the whole I don't think he reduces the core confusion. In particular, he doesn't recognise (at least, he doesn't acknowledge in this article) that the core of frustration with "railroad" GMing has do with player expectations and desires. He just talks about techniques - a coarse-grained version of what you're doing here.)<br/><br/>Once we have a richer set of concepts and an associated vocabulary, we can say things like "The term 'railroading' is used to mean various different things, but most commonly it means ... . It's also often used to mean something like ... but where ... . It can mean ... but most other users of the term reject that because ..." And <i>then</i> we can re-engage with the complaints people have about "railroading", in a respectful way that maybe even breaks a little new ground.<br/><br/>(For the record, the existing theory <i>that I'm aware of</i> doesn't give me concepts that let me make sense of player agency in GM'd games when I'm the GM, never mind when I'm a player. So I <i>disagree</i> with Deliverator in the post I linked just above, although this may represent my ignorance rather than a lack of knowledge by our civilisation <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> .)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19643/railroading-theory-a-functional-analysis/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19643/railroading-theory-a-functional-analysis">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19643/railroading-theory-a-functional-analysis/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19643/railroading-theory-a-functional-analysis/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19643/railroading-theory-a-functional-analysis/p4">4</a><a class=" p-5 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19643/railroading-theory-a-functional-analysis/p5" rel="next">5</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19643/railroading-theory-a-functional-analysis/p5" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19643%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19643%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Railroading Theory - A Functional Analysis - Page 5 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19643/railroading-theory-a-functional-analysis/p5" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Railroading Theory - A Functional Analysis - Page 5" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19643/railroading-theory-a-functional-analysis/p5" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="ETA: Crossposted with @Rob_Alexander.

I like what you said.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul88">@Paul88</a> - I don't think it's new to gaming, no.  And definitely not new to the literary and theatrical arts.  In the context of this site it is a word that conjures up visions of megalomaniacal GMs and victimized players, but that's a rather superstitious view.  Like believing that chemistry is bad because all magic is the work of the devil, case closed.  Everyone who holds that view has already decided, and there won't be any new insights coming from them on this topic.<br/><br/>Getting past that...  <br/><br/>Once we break rails down into their various types, constituent parts and narrative contexts, we can begin to see new possibilities arise, such as the list of bulletpointed questions above.  For instance, what if we play with who gets to establish a rail?  What if we try to see how many types of rails we can stick in a single network?

These patterns have always been strong in the hobby, and I (for one) only came back to the hobby after several years out when I discovered the Forge and thus a community of people who were developing RPGs in a different direction. When they see a thread like this on Storygames, they're unsurprisingly scared that that community is being washed away, and the traditional play culture <i>that they hate</i> is reasserting itself. The culture outside of this little post-Forge enclave is full of normative statements in favour of the playstyle they fear.<br/><br/>That's what they're afraid of.<br/><br/>This is a political issue - it's about something where different people have incompatible desires and values. Any public discussion of it therefore has a political effect - some influence on who gets power, what desires are supported by the wider community, and on what values are enshrined as norms. This effect may not be profound, in any case given case - this particularly thread might have only a tiny effect - but it's never wholly absent.<br/><br/>(Is it fair to say, Tod, is that you're confident, assertive individual who tends to have a lot of say in how the games they play in are run? And is it fair to say that you GM a lot more than you play, and that you rarely want for players?<br/><br/>E.g. at one time you were the GM for a group of players who paid your living expenses so that you could GM full time. That makes it sound like you'll never have a problem getting players.<br/><br/>For people who aren't like that --- people who aren't  confident, people who don't tend to hold much social power in the groups that they're in, people who want to play more than they want to GM, people who want to GM but find it hard to get players --- this kind of discussion might can feel very different.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440147/#Comment_440147" name="Item_203" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-16T10:37:43+00:00" title="November 16, 2014 10:37AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One final point, for now, until I have time to read and think about this some more:<br/><br/>I agree pretty strongly with Paul_T's post here <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/436796/#Comment_436796" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/436796/#Comment_436796</a>\n<blockquote><i>the *worrisome* part of all this is the implication that "artistic intent" overrides consent. It's bizarre to say that a term which means "some of the people involved were unhappy with how it went and felt powerless" is "subjective" and "blind prejudice". Clearly they didn't have a good time, and I see no rightful reason to ignore that.</i><br/></blockquote>\nWhenever I hear talk about "railroading" and similar issues, this is the thing that blazes into my consciousness - the desire to protect people (and myself) from feeling manipulated and powerless in roleplaying contexts. I want to develop techniques for being a better citizen in this regard myself - both when I'm the authority figure (e.g. where I'm a respected GM, or that player that the novice GM looks to for an approving nod after making a controversial statement) and when I'm just an ordinary participant. I want to develop techniques for undermining people who run games in manipulative ways, particularly if one or more players gets quite upset. I want to encourage people who feel manipulated (or otherwise unhappy but unable to talk about it) to speak out.<br/><br/>(Introspecting further, I suspect I'm subconsciously dragging in lots of related desires to protect people from bullying, manipulation and being unable to even explain what their problems are, in lots of other non-RPG contexts on lots of unrelated issues. There are lots of situations where people of low status are pushed around and thwarted and are frustrated that they can't coherently talk about it. Quite often, they can't talk about it because the language they need to do so is continually redefined by higher-status people so that what the low-status people say doesn't mean what they want it to mean. So all my (small-group-culture-related) social justice instincts are firing.)<br/><br/>As a result of that, and factors I call "political" in my posts above, I feel a strong temptation to come into this thread and basically "run friction" on it until it breaks down. Indeed, I feel a temptation to come in and try to aggravate people until someone foams over so much that James kills the thread... while managing to appear fairly reasonable myself, thus preserving my social image here. Those are the "bad reasons" that I referred to in my apology some posts back. (In my defence, I became aware of those reasons by introspecting after Rickard criticised me - they weren't my conscious motives when I first posted)<br/><br/><b>I'm not going to do those things</b>, because I don't think this issue is important enough to engage in that kind of low conduct (it's a hobby, one of many that people can engage in, not e.g. a workplace or a university course where people's participation is very high-stakes and it costs them much more to walk away) and because I think there is genuine value here in understanding this topic better.<br/><br/>I suspect I'm not the only one who feels this way, perhaps without consciously realising it, and hence the trouble having threads here on this topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440148/#Comment_440148" name="Item_204" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-16T10:41:23+00:00" title="November 16, 2014 10:41AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2014 11:57AM by AsIf.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, you get the award for self-reflection today.

Because while what you say appears laudable if anyone feels differently (and millions do) your reaction will cause them to have your reaction against you, and the only possible outcome is total war.<br/><br/>If instead we could strip away the connotation from the denotation to allow a term to represent only one actual thing, and implement approachable language for people to voice their preferences and concerns, we would likely find greater agreement on the sub-topics and have an easier time just being ok with the types of games we like without having to attack the types we don't.<br/><br/>At least in theory.<br/><br/>As it relates to this thread in example: Is railroading neutralizing impact of player choice without consent, even with consent, or is it linear or single-entry/single-exit adventure design? So long as people use it interchangeably to refer to all three we're stuck in a 'cold war scenario' because it can't have a negative connotation without attacking people you don't even disagree with, nor a positive without disenfranchising. It gets even worse when it's used as a catchall to refer to DM-centric game design (which I have heard before as well).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440160/#Comment_440160" name="Item_207" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-16T20:51:16+00:00" title="November 16, 2014  8:51PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Some interesting observations, <a href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">@phoenix182</a>.  Personally I'm not that interested in convincing the majority of anyone to do anything regarding linguistic justice or whatever, but I support any attempts to do so.  Me, I'm interested in the structure, context, and potential applications of the dynamics and design goals at play <i>within</i> things that some people might call "railroading" in a pejorative sense.  Because there is more than one simple thing going on here, and a "one size fits all" word (no matter how well-known) is not going to cut the mustard.<br/><br/>For me as well as for Hindmarch, the first level of distinction is separating the noun from the verb, the rail from the roading.  So (see OP) the primary purpose of this conversation is technical, exploratory and analytical, not social, linguistic, or normative.  <br/><br/>Some people plant seeds in others' minds.  I respect that, and I wouldn't mind seeing the pejorative kneejerk fall by the wayside, but that's not really what I'm focusing on here.  I'm more interested in doing organic chemistry on the molecular components of the seeds themselves: Breaking them down, diagramming their structures, considering different contexts and fractal levels for them, recombining them with other elements, synthesizing them, and discovering other applications for them.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nI understand that, but here's the thing: this thread is a mess precisely because the term is loaded and not singularly defined.

Indeed I think that this blurry area some people have between ludomechanical concepts and real-world socio-political behavior is exactly the overlap that causes rebuttals and ego-defense mechanisms to kick in.  Rob spoke of a visceral desire to kill the thread.  That's an emotional response, not a rational one. (And big kudos to Rob for recognizing the difference - since most don't.)<br/><br/>This is ironic for me since politically I am an anarchist wonk, and within the context of the activist community I advocate for the same types of values (athenian democracy, inclusive consensus, progressive stack, frequent re-evaluation, distributed processing, redundant data storage, etc) as are espoused by those who rail against railroading in a game context.  But professionally I am an "auteur", a "boutique", a "maverick" or whatever word you want to use for an artist who uses systems and technology in experimental and deliberately didactic ways, often with the intent of progressing or exploring a gestalt theme via the interaction of narrative objects and humans.<br/><br/>To add to the irony, I don't even tend to run "plots" but rather object-oriented sandboxes.  I am not an apologist for people whose games are artless ego-prisons or psychic poison.  I'm more like a scientist (Tim Leary, perhaps), who is analyzing that poison to discover its components and potential uses in related areas, such as narrative subsystem design.  <br/><br/>From my perspective, the differences between artistic style and social responsibility couldn't be clearer.  Likewise for the differences between theory and practice.<br/><br/>But hey - even if that distinction isn't clear to someone else, surely they can still see that there may be some potential value one day to some guy doing his own weird theoretical research on the topic.

I have given them all terms below.  As usual in this thread, please consider all my terms as placeholders specific to this model.<br/><br/>We have...<br/><b>FUDGING</b> (aka "Manual Override")<br/><b>RAILING</b> (aka "Safety Rails")<br/><b>PUSHING</b> (aka "Story Control")<br/><b>ROADING</b> (aka "Linear Network")<br/><br/>Some samples from each category:<ul><li>Constraints on Descriptive Freedom = railing</li><li>Constraints on PC Moves or Decisions = railing</li><li>Constraints on Narrative Freedom = railing</li><li>Disregard of Dice Rolls = fudging</li><li>Disregard of Narrative Choices = pushing</li><li>Disregard of PC Moves or Decisions = pushing</li><li>Forced/Inevitable Scenes = roading</li><li>Adherence to Prewritten Plot = roading</li></ul>\nDid I miss any other good ones?<br/><br/>Some thoughts based on the above list of actions:<br/>Railings are constraints, like safety rails on highways or the outer walls of the bumpercar ride.<br/>Roading is fractal in that it requires Railing and/or Pushing; i.e. it is an end, not a means.<br/>Roading may be strategic (pre-plotting) or emergent (reactive plotting).<br/>With the exception of fudging (unless rolls are hidden), all may be done with or without Misrepresentation<br/>Misrepresentation may be tacit (omission) or explicit (prevaracation)<br/>Miscommunication may occur between rules and GM, between module and GM, between rules and module, or between GM and Players<br/><br/><i>(Note to programmers: This is clearly an MVC model.)</i><br/><br/>Descriptions/Examples:<ul><li>Constraints on Descriptive Freedom (railing) - "You can't make up anything about X, because reasons"</li><li>Constraints on PC Moves or Decisions (railing) - "You can't use that ability/item right now, because reasons"</li><li>Constraints on Narrative Freedom (railing) - "That can't happen in the story now, because reasons"</li><li>Disregard of Dice Rolls (fudging) - "Instead of what the system just said, here's what actually happens"</li><li>Disregard of Narrative Choices (pushing) - "Instead of the arc you want, the arc is actually this"</li><li>Disregard of PC Moves or Decisions (pushing) - "Instead of the move you just made, this is what actually happened"</li><li>Forced/Inevitable Scenes (roading) - "This Scene is going to happen no matter what you do"</li><li>Adherence to Prewritten Plot (roading)  - "This Sequence is going to unfold in order no matter what you do"</li></ul>\nI have placed these in order of subjective severity, YMMV.<br/>The first two are standard limitations or even stated rules in most traditional RPGs.<br/>The third is often expected or even required by some traditional RPG adventure modules.<br/>The fourth is basically Rule 0.<br/>All except dice-fudging can occur innocently, due to inevitable Epistemological Uncertainty within the Fiction<br/><br/>I think all of these are intrusions or ambiguities as to the effect of Narrative Intent upon the Fiction...?  i.e. conflicts in the overlap between Narrative and Story, as seen by Players with different Narrative Structures in mind.<br/>Thus any doubts that arise will involve expectations of Narrative Agency, or misjudgment/disagreement on Narrative Structure.<br/><br/>Here's where we must talk about <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19878/the-difference-between-narrative-and-story" rel="nofollow">the difference between Narrative and Story</a>.

Tod, that's hilarious.  I am pretty flexible and enjoy dabbling in different playstyles -- a lot of the stuff other folks hate, I can enjoy if I'm in the right mood -- but you managed to list some things that sound genuinely, fundamentally unappealing to me!<br/><br/>I feel like your list of outcomes covers the bases pretty well, but your list of methods to get there shows only my least favorite ones.  I can't tell if the methods are intended to be specified -- basically, intervention -- or whether that's accidental.  If you'd like to distinguish between methods at this stage, I'd add categories wherein the constraints on What The Players Can Do are provided by premise, structure, narration techniques, and other pervasive factors.  So, like:\n<ul><li>Constraints on Descriptive Freedom - "We're playing an encounter with an alien land, where a big part of the fun is discovery.  I'll do all the determining what's in your environment so you can remain in explorer mode."</li><li>Constraints on PC Moves - "Your enemy has cast a spell that disables that!  NOW what do you do?"</li><li>Constraints on PC Decisions - "Before you do that, let me just remind you of X.  Doesn't really seem like a great idea, now, does it?  What does your character hope to gain here?  Let me suggest a better way."</li><li>Constraints on Narrative Freedom - "Wait!  We can cover that, but first, let me share this other thing with you!"</li><li>Disregard of Dice Rolls - "Something is different here; you have no idea if your efforts which normally succeed will be sufficient this time."</li><li>Disregard of Narrative Choices - "Wait, remember, we're playing a game about X."</li><li>Disregard of PC Moves or Decisions - "Cool, you do that, expecting that X will happen -- but then Y happens instead!  And here's why."</li><li>Forced/Inevitable Scenes - "Your only way to get what you want is this way."</li><li>Adherence to Prewritten Plot  - "And then (this thing I had planned) happens!"</li></ul>\n<br/>Actually, wait, crap, that's still intervention, except for the very first one!  Let me try again:<br/><br/>\n<ul><li>Constraints on Descriptive Freedom - "You can only speak in character."</li><li>Constraints on PC Moves - "This game doesn't include moves."</li><li>Constraints on PC Decisions - "Make the standard roll to overcome your fear and act.  Here's the target number, based on the reasons to fear."</li><li>Constraints on Narrative Freedom - "GM does scene framing."</li><li>Disregard of Dice Rolls - "Diceless game."</li><li>Disregard of Narrative Choices - "You can only speak in character."</li><li>Disregard of PC Moves or Decisions - "In this alien scenario, you don't initially know what'll work."</li><li>Forced/Inevitable Scenes - "Linear dungeon crawl."</li><li>Adherence to Prewritten Plot  - "The job of players in this game is to emote and react to the Lovecraftian madness and revelations I assail you with."</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440198/#Comment_440198" name="Item_215" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-19T05:34:25+00:00" title="November 19, 2014  5:34AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent!

A cube.  The horizontal axes represent the operant story-space; all possible stories in this particular world.  X is <i>Space</i> and Y is <i>Time.</i>  The Z axis (vertical) represents <i>Meaning,</i> which is a multivariant dependent on genre, and in this case I'm going to call it "Tension".  So left/right is moving through space, forward/back is moving through time, and up/down is higher tension vs lower tension.  Got that in your head?  Good.  Let's apply this model to an RPG session.<br/><br/>As Players move around in the world, if we look downward on the cube their path will tend to meander left and right (space) while drifting forward (time) across the grid.  A flashback scene would create a zigzag, like a retrograde, quickly orienting itself forward again.  The system and the Players themselves handle the generation and dispatching of most of the stuff that plots that line, with only mechanical references required of the GM.  This is all as expected.  But if the GM has a Narrative Structure in mind (or if the game enforces it mechanically), that's not the only way the GM is looking at it.  They're constantly looking at the cube <i>sideways,</i> trying to accomplish a "Flightpath" with that pleasantly rising arc, stomach-tickling climax and soft-landing denoument that we all crave like sugar and warm cuddles.  If the GM works the "altitude control", the Players can have total sandbox-freedom on the horizontal plane but be dynamically guided and delimited on the vertical axis, as the GM increases and decreases their "altitude".<br/><br/># # #<br/><br/>Beginning of session: You wander around and I toss out ideas and encounters as I describe whatever you wish to see, reflecting your energies back at you to focus on your own nuances and building off of whatever we come up with (including content that is generated by the rules directly, or by the module, or by my favorite supplemental tools, notes, subsystems, prep, etc) until something happens that strikes you as motivating (or perhaps you began with it already in mind, in longer campaigns this is often the case).  I use this event as my "Inciting Incident" and attach some details to it: there will be a Goal Object and at least one Caution you'll need right away.  I take advantage of your character traits both written and played - including the nature of your character's response to the Inciting Incident - and tie something about this Goal to your own personal quest/interest.  As you make whatever preparations must be made or do whatever research has to be done, I tease you with sketchy details to invoke a sense of mystery, and drop a seemingly-casual OOC comment to build a sense of suspense.  Most of this I make up on the spot, based on some random die rolls and your reactions to things.  When you're ready to roll, the "Journey To The Other Realm" will be enacted by you, all I have to do is make sure we have a feeling of "Otherness" and a slowly-building sense of "Rising Tension" (as the Z axis is doing its thing).<br/><br/>Hour 1: I give you the first significant Obstacle, which is rather minor but gives you a chance to show off your awesome character, or get used to its capabilities.  You do the driving, but by now based on how much progress we've made, I've got a good idea how to pace this session.  I now know there will be 2 more major Obstacles, Difficulties or Encounters before the Big Bad Problem Thing, and I make each of them more difficult and/or dangerous than its predecessor.  Along the way there will be incidental NPCs and things you decide to explore which turn into Subplots.  I keep them colorful and try to make them Connected to what's going on, but compared to the Main Objective they'll be either two-dimensional or brief.<br/><br/>Hour 2: I use any opportunity I get to Raise The Stakes along the way, taking you up a rising arc of increasing tension, while remaining within the reasonable boundaries of (a) the Story you choose to pursue and (b) our schedule for tonight.  Each time you defeat an Obstacle, I include a "Relief Scene" and provide some details about the Big Bad Problem Thing, to give you some useful stuff and to keep you psyched up.  The Relief Scenes tend to end with a Surprise, to kick the Tension/Altitude back into play (holy shit look how far down the ground is!)  I try to invoke a sense of a ticking clock, or a need to hurry.  This is most easily done by playing up some fear or concern voiced randomly by a Player.  The tension mounts...<br/><br/>Hour 3: In the last hour before the session is scheduled to end, you reach the Final Confrontation with the Big Bad Problem Thing.  If your characters are up to it, I may throw in an additional Twist to ratchet things up to a crazy level.  It will be the biggest and most dangerous conflict of the evening.  I push against you really hard.  I re-employ many of the details that were mentioned in passing along the way, especially the stuff that resulted in bleed or caused profound realizations about your character or your purpose.  The result is a high-density cocktail of tension, character-identification and catharsis, which explodes into climax.  As the dust settles I guide you gently down to zero tension again, carefully tie up any important loose ends (leaving a few dangling for later), and make sure to show you the changes you have brought about in others lives and possibly in your own.  This results in denouement and re-stabilization, as the capital M Meaning of your character's accomplishments sinks in and becomes, at last, a Story.  End session, thank you very much and goodnight.<br/><br/># # #<br/><br/>Note that through all the above I said basically nothing about the actual nature of the goals, difficulties, foes or details.  That's because I'm working with the Template.  I almost don't care what the details are, I just need them to exist.  I trust that those elements will get filled in as we go.  In fact like I said above, while we were playing I got most of that content directly or indirectly from you, and from the dice, and from riffing off whatever happened at the table.  But what I was *really* concentrating on was the vertical.  The arc.  You had total narrative freedom within the operant space you basically defined yourself, but you had no control over the tension/altitude at a given point in time.  You drove the Story, but I continually linked its arc to the nodes of a pre-existing Narrative Structure as we went along.<br/><br/>I think this is a type of Railroading as well.<br/><br/>But if the word "railroading" can only be applied to Story, then this is not that.<br/><br/>And if the word "railroading" can only be applied in a negative sense, I don't think this is that either.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440210/#Comment_440210" name="Item_218" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-19T15:20:11+00:00" title="November 19, 2014  3:20PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is tension the same as not unresolved conflicts, and the weight the actors attach to them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440222/#Comment_440222" name="Item_219" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-19T23:44:44+00:00" title="November 19, 2014 11:44PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2019 9:43AM by AsIf.">edited 9:43AM</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, raised stakes and unresolved conflicts result in escalation, but it can be more than that.
