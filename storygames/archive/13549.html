RPGnet sometimes "forgets" about the non-traditional and (sometimes) more elegant "indie" and rule-lite game systems out there.  <br/><br/>My question for topic is... If you were to begin building your own Super Hero rule system,  looking back to ALL the previous Supers game systems,  also looking at non-supers RPGs,  also looking at board games and card games,  and looking at the style of comic books and super hero cartoons and movies...  <br/><br/>If you were to line up specific rules to reference when building a NEW super hero game system what are the best of the best  rules  that you could look at  "modularly"  to gather and build your new idea?<br/><br/><br/>EXAMPLES:<br/><br/>Are "Hero Points"  necessary for a supers game?  If so,  which game system(s) have the best options for Hero Point rules?  Would you combine or borrow from multiple games?  Are there non-supers games that include a form of  "action,  karma, drama"  points that you'd look to?<br/><br/>Getting your hero or a villain  "Knockbacked"  is a common element of supers stories.  What system handles knockback the best?  <br/><br/>Supers have a high degree of  "swing"  in the way their stories are told in battles and action.  Meaning,  even a lesser powerful character can sometimes (with a lucky or well planned shot)  take out a Bigger threat.  What  rule  or  die roll type  do you feel captures this best  and  most elegantly?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In general,  if you were to list specific rule points from your favorite games that would be fun to look at while building a NEW super hero RPG - what would they be?  From the oldest systems  to the newest?  From super RPGs specific  to  non-supers games  to  other game types  such as Video Games or Board Games, Miniature Games or Card Games?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
