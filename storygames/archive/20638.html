So, when I playtest my own stuff, I may be far more focused on the playing/GMing/assistant-GMing than I am on the playtesting. Depending on the ease of redesigning on the hoof, generally speaking I am not averse to house-ruling my own rules during playtesting, then possibly adopting the house-rules later if they seem to work better than the rules-as-written. Sometimes I may drive the game towards a particular situation where I can test as-yet-untried rules, but that's rarely necessary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452913/#Comment_452913" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-03T22:59:42+00:00" title="May  3, 2016 10:59PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben, when I read your post earlier on your blog, I was nodding vigorously \u2014 like you'd just put into concise, effective words something which has been on my mind for a long time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452930/#Comment_452930" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T07:54:20+00:00" title="May  4, 2016  7:54AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2016 7:55AM by Rickard.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whenever I playtest my own stuff at gaming conventions, I always tell the rest of the players that it's a playtest.

That's what honesty demands, and I also want them to harbor realistic expectations, so that if the game somehow breaks down mid-play, or has to be jury-rigged, players don't experience it as a betrayal.<br/><br/>That is, I use "it's a playtest" as a code for "it's an alpha stage product: I provide no warranties". I expect people to jump onto the playtest wagon despite that disclaimer, out of curiosity for trying something new, or the sheer goodwill of helping me/the designer with our project, and in fact lots of people do.<br/><br/>But I've noticed a hiccup as well: some people, probably just a minority of them, understand "playtest" as the code for quite a different activity from "playing a game". They either play with reduced commitment (specifically, reduced creative or emotional involvement) or actively attempt to sabotage the game. Both approaches are warranted to make the game a failure, and a waste of everybody's time including mine, and the latter is also very demanding of the sabotaging participant, leaving them exhausted. When I read Ben's post, I thought it was about those situations, and specifically preventing them.<br/><br/>For example, short after first drafting <i>Enter the Avenger</i>, before submitting it to Worlds Without Master, I took the game to a local convention and wished to try it out. I was going around and asking people to playtest it with me, and a friend of mine replied: \xabNo, thanks. I'm quite tired at the moment. I could stand some role-<i>play</i>, you know, but not play-<i>testing</i>! That's exhausting.\xbb<br/><br/>Me: \xabActually, I've just drafted out this game and want to try it out for the first time. I need to know whether the idea of it holds together in practice, but there's no need to, like, "stress test" it yet. It's too early a stage. I just want to <i>play</i>.\xbb<br/><br/>My friend: \xabWhat's the point of testing, then?\xbb<br/><br/>I was baffled \u2014 I always am \u2014 but, truly, this isn't an uncommon perspective. My current understanding is that this specific outlook on playtesting, that it's a chore because you have to try hard and break the game, comes from boardgames. For one thing, I never encountered it in the chamber-larping community, as opposed to the tabletop role-playing crowd. I believe those friends of mine who think like that are all hardcore boardgamers who either identify as boardgamers first and roleplayers second, or consider tabletop RPGs to be a subset of boardgames (myself, I'm just a casual boardgamer - I don't feel like I belong in the subculture, if there's one).<br/><br/>But my experience so far is that no <i>role-playing game</i> can actually be "stress tested" that way! As a shared creative endeavor, if there's one participant actively trying to "break" an RPG, it'll break \u2014 i.e. fail as an activity \u2014 no matter how "solid" the design is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452943/#Comment_452943" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T15:56:08+00:00" title="May  4, 2016  3:56PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>But my experience so far is that no <i>role-playing game</i> can actually be "stress tested" that way! </blockquote>\n"Whatever works for you, man!"

He heard horns honking, people screaming out their windows at him , but their warnings brought only slight shudders.

Genuinely helpful playtests are out to answer a question ("Does this system work?"): it might be focused on a very specific part of the system or it might be purposefully general, but it has to address that question if it's going to really be a playtest. You might have fun playing, you might fall in love or hate with the premise of the game, you might be sold or unsold on the game, but none of those things are as important as the <i>test</i>. (and as a corollary, if any of those things come first, then maybe what you want to do isn't a playtest.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453021/#Comment_453021" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-06T09:46:44+00:00" title="May  6, 2016  9:46AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember when I was young and tried game mastering my second game.

It's interesting and very opinionated stuff about design in general and game design in particular. I don't agree with everything but they do have a very interesting set up where they do <i>different kinds</i> of playtests at different stages in the game. When they're just trying out whether or not their ideas are actually even fun, they just play. No "stress test". The stress test comes later.<br/><br/><br/>That said.

Mainly Fastaval, and as all the games there are meant to be run by total strangers and usually only tested once or twice beforehand, I'd say I have some experience.<br/>Here's what I've learned: Don't try to change what doesn't make sense when reading it. It can turn out to be an essential mechanic in play, even if you can't understand why it would work when just reading it.<br/>Do a read test. Simply read the game, and note what doesn't make sense to you, or what you need clarified. All writers have things that make sense in their heads. Sometimes they manage to put it in writing, sometimes they don't. Tell them.<br/>When running the game for others, try to get them through as many nooks and crannies of the game as makes sense. Don't try too hard. For the players, it's still a game they <i>play</i>. If they consider it a test instead of a vessel for having fun, they can't test the game. After all, a game is meant to be fun. If you're too focused on testing, you're not having fun, therefore not testing.<br/>Do a debrief. Ask what worked and what didn't. The players <i>will</i> exchange war-stories. Let them, but sort the wheat from the chaff. Ask leading questions, such as "What made this bad".<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
