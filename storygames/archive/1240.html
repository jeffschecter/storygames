                    So I got <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/Rob%20Donoghue.pdf" rel="nofollow">Rob Donoghue's sheet</a>.<br/><br/>I've got that nice yellow square in the middle.  I want to slap a pad of PostIt notes right there -- peel off the back sheet, right, and affix it right onto the sheet.  Then in the course of play, STUFF can be written on the top sheet, used temporarily, and then pulled off and discarded in favor of a blank slate on which more STUFF can be written.<br/><br/>I just dunno what kind of STUFF to write in there.  It needs to be something that is (a) important enough to write down, preferably mechanically significant; (b) totally discarded ten or fifteen times in the course of a game; and (c) never comes back.<br/><br/>Here's some of my initial ideas:<br/>a) roles or masks that the player-characters take on, allowing the PCs to be actors... or spies or con men.<br/>b) setting details in a very serial sort of game, like different islands visited in an island-hopping game.<br/>c) "status effects" like posthypnotic suggestions, genetic modifications, downloaded skills, etc<br/>d) transient goals, oaths, or bets -- "I will kill the monster with one hand behind my back!"<br/><br/>Any other ideas?  Any of these sound particularly grabby?  Love to hear some other points of view...                </div>

                            The only problem with (d) is that you could only have one at a time, and have to clear it in order to start another one.  Which, you know, might be interesting somehow, but is at the very least counter-intuitive.                        </div>

                            I really, really like A. D can be remembered in play easily in many cases and  won't need to be written down. If you have a quick, mechanically significant way of generating 'who am I this time?' that has a couple of stats or several other things to write down, that's more likely to be worth writing down to remember in the short term and then discarding when the identity (or shape or dream-persona or whatever) is abandoned in favor of a new one.  I like the idea that you could rip off the top sheet, be like 'Oh yeah, well now I'm X!', roll 4 dice for X's trait scores and quickly narrate them on to your new post it, then use those for a while until its time for another.                        </div>

                            You know, you can write stuff on post-its deep in the stack without taking the whole stack apart.  So you could, I dunno, pass the stacks around, write stuff on random pages, then be surprised as they are revealed in play.  Removing the top note is a choice that invites the unexpected.                        </div>

                            I love a post-it.  They could form an internal currency, character or scene components, you can make patterns or maps or boards with them, swap them, destroy them.  In Drowning and Falling they are supposed to visually represent the dungeon you are building on the fly.  Flexible and sticky!                        </div>

                            Map elements. You may design a game where the players are to create a world, explore it, and tell the stories that makes it come to life. The sheet would lend itself to such a game, being sober and temple-like.<br/>
<br/>
the center would be for post it notes of yellow or bleak colour, to be drawn upon by certain rules. The players take turns placing their map elements on a central cardboard and expanding on the story of the world. By certain rules a player may remove an element on the cardboard too, and replace it with one of his own, where cities are ruined, grown or something else has changed.<br/>
<br/>
Thus you may create the worlds you never dreamed about...                        </div>

                            Just looking at the sheet puts me in mind of a board game, suggesting that the yellow stickies are the equivalent to "Chance" or "Community Cards".  So, in my mind, character gen is about designing your personal game board which then plays into your resolution mechanics.<br/><br/>But that's just me.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

                            I totally like Jason's plan of making them game currency, that you swap around among players.<br/><br/>Here's something that Shreyas, Thomas, and I were talking about for <i>Four Nations</i>: having stackable things that you could work on in the order from top -&gt; bottom.  If you complete the top one, you pull it off and move to the one below.  But you could also have stuff stacked on top (by yourself, by other players), which you have to complete before continuing to work on the ones underneath.  Think of it sorta like Tetris or other puzzle games where another player's success adds extra bricks to your side.  I really dig the idea of various players slapping post-its on each other's stacks, demanding that they do X, Y, or Z before continuing with their own plans.                        </div>

A description of use is written on the pad when the player acts on these abilities. It then covers over the ability describing the use and refining it. Each time an ability is used, it moves from general to specific.                        </div>

                            Apart from loving the idea of writing things down on later sheets to be revealed later, I'm really confused:<br/><br/>Why would you use Post-Its (brand sticky notes, TM the 3M Corporation) for something that goes away?  I totally think notes should come off your pad to go onto someone else's sheet.  Or the table.  Or your forehead.

                            I have some feedback, but most of it I will save in case I end up judging it (my understanding is that everyone who participated will judge a certain number games/sheets, but not all. Am I correct in this?).<br/><br/>First though, I really love the semi-mystical, ethereal quality of the setting and goals of the protagonists. In fact, I could see Atlantis serving as a metaphor for any near-impossible resolution. For example, upon reading the text, the thing that struck me was that I could play it as a group of spirits (protagonists) reincarnating (visiting) in various lifetimes (the isles), trying to achieve enlightenment (find Atlantis): Which is also why characters have no names...because they go through many different names in all their lives.<br/><br/>Perhaps leaving the option open in the text for the players to define what Atlantis and the isles represent catapults the game into esoteric philosophy mumbo-jumbo...but I really the dig the possibility.                        </div>

                            Thanks for the feedback, thwaak!<br/><br/>I'm hoping that the game will lead folks towards that sort of play, even if they don't intentionally set out to do so from the start.  So if they start off on the first island thinking they're Argonauts or similar, as their cornerstones start getting swapped out, they'll quickly start seeing everything change around them.  In fact I suspect that the end-state of the game will tend to be even stranger than spirits revisiting lifetimes -- something closer to the Dark Tower series, where players realize that they've been playing 'characters' who are, in fact, metaphysical concepts or something.                        </div>

                            I do too, Meg.  I'm just wondering where on the spectrum it falls between "Pushes Play in Interesting Directions" and "Making the Game Totally Unplayable."<br/><br/>What do you do when somebody slaps a truly odd keyword on your sheet?  What if your Horseriding, Gunslinging, and Leatherworking Talents get turned into Horseriding, Gunslinging, and Leatherworking Bees?  There's some auto-correct in that the joker who puts "Spermatazoa" on a Log page and slaps it on the island is most likely going to get it slapped right back on his own character sheet, but I suspect that that isn't quite enough to get the game-breaky cornerstones out of play.<br/><br/>Perhaps I need some mechanic that lets you change your own cornerstones?  But I'm loathe to do this...                        </div>

                            Just added a centering mechanic -- Judson, I'm starting to really like this concept -- and I am all fucking excited about the game, now.<br/><br/>Last phase of conflict resolution, you go around the table one last time.  If you want to squeeze out a few more points, you can "Tap the Globe" and explain how all of your actions in the present conflict are actually forwarding one of the things that you wrote into the Globe.  The Globe, if you don't recall, contains your ostensible destination, your apparent purpose, what you believe your purpose is, and what you suspect your true purpose is.  So if you play towards one of those, you can add a number of points equal to the unspent rows in that quarter -- 1 to 5.  You spend a point from one of those unspent rows to do this, so it's a limited resource.<br/><br/>Even if you aren't planning on using those points, though, you'll still be roleplaying towards it, just in case one of the other players pulls out the stops somehow and tops your score.  It's like a safety net, there if you need it, <em>if you roleplay towards it</em>.<br/><br/>It will also be pushing the game forward, since the quarters with the most unspent rows of points will be those that you've only recently unlocked.  Your ostensible destination will be tapped out first; it will give you no benefit to keep up the pretense, so you can drop it.  It will be much more lucrative for you to be working towards what you believe or suspect your true purpose to be.<br/><br/>I need to play this thing, now.                        </div>

                            So it was me, my wife Laura, and Jesse.  I claimed I was going to the Royal Palace; Jesse was going to Geist Mortua, the island of the dead; Laura was going to the throne room of Atlantis.  So.<br/><br/><strong>Hesperides</strong><br/>I started us off in the Hesperides, to kind of ground the beginning in something solid.  We very quickly determined that +10 difficulty would be unplayable, so switched over to +5 per island from the get-go.  I'm very glad we did this.  As we started putting down the first pages and framing scenes that went nowhere, we also improvized a rule that said you could slap down a page and immediately pass the Captain marker if you didn't see a conflict worth pursuing yet.  This was also a good addition.  In the Hesperides, we added a Marketplace and some Theives, who ran off with our stuff.  When we gave chase (first conflict), Laura and I staked getting our stuff back while Jesse planted a totem on Laura's character.  Jessee, see, was already planning.  Once we caught the theives, they pleaded with us to let them go or else they'd be executed.  I slapped down Law, the fourth page of the island, and narrated us to conflict where I demanded local justice.  I got to claim two pages and Jesse and Laura only one each, so I managed to beat them out on that one.  Then the theives escaped, anyway, and we proceeded on to the next island.<br/><br/><strong>Misthaven</strong><br/>I happened to start off the next island, as well.  We did the quick round-robin thing where we just slapped down pages onto the island until it was interesting; Jesse put down a Blood Temple and a Goddess Ritual because he's creepy like that.  Also, he was thinking ahead.  Oh, and he had directed the theives to meet us here, so he had a little retinue.  Jesse tries to get Laura's character to spill her blood into the spring that came out of the catacombs where the temple was located.  His stakes were "get the blood in the water" and Laura's were "don't spill the blood in the water <em>consciously</em>."  I supported Laura; everyone won their stakes but Laura won narration, taking control of how the pinprick scratch she had picked up got washed in the spring.  The next scene jumped to that night, with Lunacy being added to the island and the townspeople swarming the inn going after the ring with which Jesse's character had pricked Laura's earlier.  Lunacy was my page to play, and it worked to force Jesse to reveal his agenda: to summon a goddess-demon into Laura's character's body, then proceed to the land of the dead to resurrect his dead wife.  Laura and I went for stakes "Leave the island" while Jesse went for "Perform the ritual."  Everyone again got their stakes, with Jesse netting narration control.  He tricked my character into finding a boat and then tricked Laura's character into the catacombs.  He then used his theif minions to tie her down, and the ritual was completed: Laura's character was carrying a goddess-demon's essence.  They got to the boat with Laura's character fuming.  Jesse takes souvenirs and puts Goddess Ritual on Laura's cornerstone, making what had been her Talents into supernatural abilities.<br/><br/><strong>Geist Mortua</strong><br/>By happenstance, I then named the <em>next</em> island.  I decided not to pull any punches and sent us directly to Geist Mortua, the land of the dead, where Jesse had claimed to be going to raise his wife.  The characters chase each other off or slip away.  Jesse's character heads to the graveyard of Geist Mortua, where everyone who has ever died has a headstone.  Laura's character makes a connection with the goddess and performs a ritual to incarnate the goddess outside her own body.  My character finds Jesse's in the graveyard, steals his precious ring and compels him to help him find the tomb of King Menelaus.  About this time a giant column of light explodes out of the forest, and Jesse knows that the goddess is now coming for himfor vengeance.  However, my character pries the King's crown off of his dessicated head, puts it on, and strides out to meet the goddess.  Now, I was planning on just having some sort of binding or control over the goddess, but Jesse goes and slaps down a page titled Wedding.  So I say fine, and go whole hog: my stakes are to marry the goddess and become the King of the Underworld.  In roleplay I let on that this had been my plan all along, and thank you Jesse for summoning the goddess and bringing her here as I manipulated you to do.  Jesse's stakes are promptly declared as "Get out of here."  Laura debates on whether or not to directly oppose me, but decides to support Jesse, thereby pooling their resources.  Both stakes are won, and I gain control of narration thanks to the Lunacy +7 page Laura used on my cornerstone on the last island.  As the boat's about to leave and Laura's character is naming herself captain, the King of the Underworld steps on board and promotes her to admiral of his fleet.  For Souvenirs, I take Sorcerer-King and Fisher-King off of Geist Mortua and I slap them on Laura and Jesse's Logs.<br/><br/><strong>Edge</strong><br/>I then get to create the <em>next</em> island, as well, and this is getting ridiculous.  I name it Edge, and make it the island on the edge of the world, with the ocean pouring over the edge of the world to either side of it.  Laura and Jesse must put the Sorcerer-King and Fisher-King pages onto the island or nothing at all, so they're added in shortly.  However, they're going to bail, so Laura immediately sets stakes for leaving the island; meanwhile, I'm drumming up a fleet.  There aren't enough pages on the island for divided stakes to both be won, so the island-leavers take the day.  I don't get my fleet, and they fly off into the sky to their next destination.  Which I, for a change, don't create.                        </div>

<strong>Sorrow's Memory</strong><br/>We go around the table I think two or three times adding pages and explaining how they relate without framing a scene.  This island is floating off in the middle of the sky, pouring waterfalls off the edges that crystalize into ice, and the ice crystals are used to build the city on top.  The Lonely Princess pines after her prince, who is buried away in the Ice.  Laura's character heads off to look in the Library; Jesse's character wants to go check out the waterfalls.  That's about the time when I spring the King of the Underworld on Jesse (who hadn't quite been <em>floundering</em> but had certainly had his resurrect-my-wife mojo sincerely fucked with) and tell him that he should really work on not being a puppet so much.  Jesse flees, gets roped into a puppet show that sets up a pretty plain allegory between himself and the trapped prince and his dead wife and the island's princess, and looming danger to Laura's character.  By the time he gets to the library to warn her, the King is there, and he brings the library down in flames around them.  Laura saves her geneology research (and has one of her cornerstones transformed to Lonely Princess).  Jesse gets flung out the window, slides down the ice, until he's in a ice cavern face-to-face with the frozen prince.  He resolves to wake the prince (his stakes); I jump in and support his stakes.  So it's down to control of narration for what waking the prince actually <em>means</em>.  I win, and I reveal both the prince and the princess to be nothing more than animated ice sculptures, and hautily explain that the entire island had been fabricated to get Jesse's character to realize that he is actually my son, the Prince of the Underworld.  Meanwhile, the island collapses.  Laura's character makes it to the docks; my character makes it to his shadowy ghost ship; Jesse's character falls into the nothing along with the rest of the island.<br/><br/><strong>Kai Durrel</strong><br/>This time Laura gets to define the island, which turns out to be a not-quite-real easter island sort of thing, blockaded by an unknown fleet.  Laura's character convinces the captain of her ship to run the blockade and they skate over a reef and catch a faster current to get past the intercepting ship.  She knows -- through her research and her oft-used Maps trait -- that on the island is the last signpost to Atlantis.  So she heads uphill to the stone monuments, only to find Jesse's character, all Colonel Kurtzed out, leading the local natives in the battle against the invading marines.  They fight off the marines thanks to some divine power channeled by Jesse's character, and then he tries to approach Laura's character to either replace his dead wife or at least accord him some acceptance.  She flees, he follows; they find their way to the Keystone which opens the portal to Atlantis.  The King of the Underworld is perched on top, waiting.  He tells them that it's all come to pass as planned, and all they have to do is step through the portal.  Stakes become "Accept that everything has been fore-ordained" or "Believe that everything has been the result of personal choices."  I actually lose out against the two of them, and in order to prove his point Jesse's character rams his divine staff of office through his chest, spattering the keystone altar with blood, thereby opening the portal.  The fourth quarter is unlocked, so the next island will be Atlantis.  I lay down my stakes that Laura and Jesse's characters go through the portal; Laura supports; Jesse bows out, satisfied with martyrdom.  Laura and I beat the island (at this point a difficulty of 40, with only five or six pages on the island) and so Laura's character picks up Jesse's and heads through.<br/><br/><strong>Epilogue</strong><br/>Laura had the least unspent points, so she went first, narrating how she was the last scion of Atlantis, and was returning to Atlantis from the outside world to be crowned Queen.  She resurrects Jesse's character to ask if he would prefer to be dead or to live in Atlantis as her advisor.  I went next, and narrated the King of the Dead descending to the Underworld, his new Queen welcoming him home, and him pronouncing that a new age may now begin.  Jesse goes last, narrates that he accepts life, hands the Queen of Atlantis his signature pocketwatch, and tells her that if she ever needs him, she can contact him through that, and sets off to wander the world.                        </div>

                            So as far as scope and escalation go, the game performed admirably.  We started on a scuffle with theives and we end up with this gigantic plot where there's some conspiracy manipulating the underworld in order to restore Atlantis.  We sailed off the edge of the world.  We had mythic lineages and terrible purposes.  It was fantastic.<br/><br/>Amusingly, not letting the players write their true natures and purposes on the character sheet <em>immediately</em> made everyone suspicious of each other.  Jesse's character Sebastian was creepy from the get-go, but neither Laura's nor my character was at all trustworthy, either.  We warily watched each other the entire way to Geist Mortua, and then it was all running and chasing and craziness.<br/><br/>In fact the three of us came to the game with some very different strategies.  Laura knew from the outset that she wanted to be the last descendent of Atlantis, and she managed to hint about that and work towards it the entire game.  Jesse came to the game with an initial situation and agenda, which got totally overturned halfway through but provided us good grist.  Jesse said in the aftergame that he did not feel at loose ends afterwards thanks to the developing goals laid out in the Globe, which was good (Jesse, care to elaborate?).  I played the game as a complete blank slate, playing some guy in a navy uniform and only later developing him into this conspirator willing to take incredible steps to inaugurate a new age.  All three approaches seemed to work out, although Laura's was probably the most difficult; in a few places she had to work to maintain her planned identity.<br/><br/>On the other hand, an emergent property that I <em>totally should have seen coming</em> was that we started transforming each other's cornerstones in ways that were appropriate to the character.  Jesse got Twilight and Wedding and Imprisonment; Laura got Bloodline and Goddess Ritual and Ancient Decendents; I got Sorcerer-King and Fisher-King and later Reflection (turning from the Lunatic conspirator to the contemplative version).  We either helped each other or challenged each other to take the step further constantly, which was totally awesome.<br/><br/>In terms of currency and economy, we had a little too many available points towards the end of the game.  In the last conflict I was able to tap my fourth quarter for the full five points because I hadn't spent anything out of the last 25.<br/><br/>We didn't see many pages get slapped onto Logs and then returned to the island with a point value, but Jesse suspects (and I agree) that we were gunning for the end of the game, and trying to unlock quarters by transforming cornerstones.  If we had planned to play the game over two or three sessions at a more sedate pace, more elements would be recycled into the islands.  (Additionally, we might have spent more points on traits.)<br/><br/>I was surprised at how slowly the character sheets filled up.  After we got about five or six traits at the start of the game, we only rarely bought new stuff.  I suppose this is because the baseline of the character had been established and everything else was development, which comes slower.<br/><br/>I have a whole lot of little procedural fixes to add to the rules (and I'll get an amended version posted as soon as I can), as well, but that's the meat of it.  Love to hear your thoughts and suggestions!  I've only got a couple more days to polish this one off!                        </div>

                            Hey There,<br/>
<br/>
I did like the developing goals in the Globe.  And I noted at the time that I wasn't sure if it was a feature or a coincidence that my current goal getting shut out timed perfectly with opening up the next section of the globe.  At that point I'm not sure I was floundering so much as trying to figure out how to achieve my next goal.  As soon as "wedding" got added to my sheet I knew how I wanted to redirect my character but I was unsure as to how to go about it without coming off as a toady lap dog.<br/>
<br/>
As I expressed at the time my biggest complaint about the game is how weak it is in the opening.  What really made the game work for me is that I simply set an agenda for myself and went after it from the get go.  My fear is that that kind of attitude isn't implicit in the setup, "You're going to Atlantis..."  I happened to tack on an implicit "...for THIS reason" and then acted on that reason with passion.  I knew that reason was likely to change along the way but without an initial reason I feared the game would flounder.<br/>
<br/>
The whole character "transformation" thing was neat and is probably the game's primary reward mechanic.  It's an opportunity for me to say, "this is what I like about your character, do more of this."  I was thinking more about putting the souvenir on the log pad.  Here are the problems I see with it.<br/>
<br/>
I don't need an element on the island for it to exist in the fiction.  Even though the "Theives" sticky wasn't anywhere on Mist Haven I could still interact with them and use them in narration.  So the whole idea of "I want to see these guys again" element of that mechanic is kind of shot because I can see them whenever I want.<br/>
<br/>
However, I think that mechanic might get more play in larger group going at a more leisurely pace.  The idea that there is the potential for a mechanical boost gives me incentive to bank situation elements I know I can narrate into conflicts easily.  For example, I KNEW I wanted to use the Theives in a sacrifical ritual so it might have been in my interest to keep slapping those guys back on log books so that I can snag them for extra points anytime I was doing anything with the ritual.<br/>
<br/>
But!  There are problems with that as the mechanics stand because I can't control when they come into play and I can't control how long they stay there.  Of all the mechanics in the game I think this one could do with the most rethinking.  It's a great idea but there needs to be more of a...dare I say it...strategy element to it.  I need someway to bank those theives and have SOME say in when they come back into play so that I can draw on them when I want.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm.... It might be sufficient to say that Souvenir's go EITHER on another character's corners OR on your own log.  That way if I'm working up to something I can bank elements into my log at the cost of not being able to contribute anything to new islands.  Then when I'm ready to make my big push for what I'm working up to I can pop everything off my log stack onto an island and go for it.  This also incentivizes stepping down and letting others pursue their agendas AND thinking of ways to bend those agendas to your own so that you can bank things from their island contributions.<br/>
<br/>
Just thoughts.<br/>

Interesting... that also gives you first crack at using that page.  So if I pull Ninjas off the island and it gets a value of +7, I've got it stored away in my Log so when I slap it back on that island or a later island, I get first dibs on using it for that conflict.  I think that's doable.  The putting it on other players' Logs was meant as a control-the-game sort of deal, but it ended up leaving a bad taste in my mouth, since it amounted to shutting down their creative input.  I like this better.<br/><br/>I'll also punch up the starting conditions, or at least advise players to have a sort starter-seed for play as you did.                        </div>
