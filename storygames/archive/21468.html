You follow a conflict, and cut as you see fit to frame another scene, ad lib. <br/><br/>To manage the frequency of cuts, and possible abuse, I resort to prior consensus : we agree that the story will be unedited (folk tale, drama), lightly edited, heavily edited (cartoon, 24hr, etc.), ***experimental***. At this stage, I am trying to "hide the seams" and get rid of as much prior consensus as possible. <br/><br/>What mechanisms can be used to limit the number of cuts ?<br/>I already thought of : <br/>- spend resource to cut scene. It's easy, but not very relevant due to the "meaning" of resources (learning from failure XP and tokens of appreciation from other players VP)<br/>- vote with unanimity less 1. It's easy and used somewhere else in the game, but it breaks the game flow.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469822/#Comment_469822" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-08T18:38:35+00:00" title="February  8, 2018  6:38PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is an interesting topic, but I think you should clarify what you mean by "scene volatility".

Have you experienced problems with scenes being cut too often/too much? Generally, I see the opposite problem in gaming.<br/><br/>*Why*, in your game, does someone want to cut a scene? What does it accomplish? <br/><br/>Answering that will give you a sense of how you may want to frame the problem/question. <br/><br/>In my game <i>Land of Nodd</i>, each player puts down a token on the table. When you feel you've gotten what you want out of the scene, you pick it up and put it back in your hand. When the last player does so, the scene ends. <br/><br/>The game is more complicated than that, and, notably, there's a chance you lose that token, which creates some interest in withdrawing it rather than just leaving it there. However, it's one thing you could try, modifying it as necessary for the needs of your game.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469832/#Comment_469832" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-08T21:28:20+00:00" title="February  8, 2018  9:28PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 8, 2018 9:31PM by DeReel.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In theory, a player may want to use "cutting a scene" as a clearing kick, if they feel they are (on the verge of) losing a conflict.<br/>In practice, I have seen it coming in a session with 3 players. Me, a friend who had already played, and a new player. The setting is an anime high school. We begin with a scene in a classroom. A conflict builds and / cut / to the gym, after the class. The experienced player chose to cut to gain better a position. And the newer player, wanting to carry on "experimenting" the classroom situation / cuts / back to a similar classroom scene, the day after. The same back and forth occurred once again in the session from kendo club to restaurant job. Nothing broken : the patch I found was to agree upon a "scene inertia" before a session. <br/>But as I said, at this stage I am collapsing the "prior agreement" bits as much as I can, and I would like to know what other options exist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469833/#Comment_469833" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-08T21:53:51+00:00" title="February  8, 2018  9:53PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that's interesting.<br/><br/>One suggestion: the player who is in the scene him or herself doesn't have the option to cut it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469834/#Comment_469834" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-08T21:54:40+00:00" title="February  8, 2018  9:54PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 8, 2018 10:23PM by DeReel.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We crossposted : I can see "a player (protagonist ?) being in a scene" but I don't see what the rule would fix or entail precisely.

The overlapping of conflicts is the reason of the game : some conflicts evolve into arcs, other wither, etc. In a way, players try to come up with the most enticing conflicts to milk their fellow players. Think <i>Capes</i>. I break the game if I equate 1 conflict with 1 scene. <br/>It is true and it has been shown in every session of the game that blanks in the narration can always become weak spots for a player, specially when they were perceived as "losing the scene". So peer pressure is a lever I can use, but I'd rather have a more "arbitrated" mechanism than "the invisible hand of the fittest for survival" if the game is to come out of playtesting stage. <br/><br/>But, simply put, the "vote building" from Land of Nodd already answers my question perfectly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469846/#Comment_469846" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-09T13:08:33+00:00" title="February  9, 2018  1:08PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way I've historically viewed this issue is that it is not legitimate to cut a scene that has positive value, and therefore it is best to allow anybody to <i>suggest</i> a cut, but then anybody may also veto that by showing that the scene still has value and should go on. As with Paul, I neither have found it necessary to have rules forbidding ending a scene - it's been much more fruitful to have rules that encourage ending, as some players have certain counter-productive creative tendencies that lead to scenes dragging on for no reason. I have never played in a game where excessive cutting would have been a problem.<br/><br/>While it is a novel idea, I don't think that scene cuts should be used for intra-dramatic purposes lightly; it's usually not a good idea to obfuscate creative choices in that manner. For example, if the game benefits from a "not yet" pacing structure that prevents certain things from occurring, that is actually a really fruitful thing for a drama game. However, I would not want to achieve this by giving the players some sort of scene cutting powers that they're supposed to use to "cut away" from events before they have a chance to occur. How would that even work, would you need to race in real time to see whether my character can steal the march and confess their love before the other guy wakes and cuts the scene from under me? That'd be just wacky.<br/><br/>(When I say "should not be used lightly", I do not mean that it should not be explored - perhaps there is something there. I just wouldn't bring that sort of radical idea into a game lightly.)<br/><br/>If you want your game to put frozen conflicts (conflicts that have been established, but they're not resolved in the same scene) into center stage, I would suggest that what your rules need to explicitly deal with is not scene cutting, but rather conflict freezing: once you've determined that "no, we are not allowed to resolve this conflict yet - we should wait", then the scene can end on its own because the players don't have anything more to add for now.<br/><br/>You might also wish to review <i>Dust Devils</i>, it's possibly the first game with explicit and player-controlled conflict freezing - could be instructive, as the game's dramatic structures are so clear-cut. The "folding" rule in DD basically says that once the conflict has been established and entered, and you've rolled your dice (well, drawn your card hand), but before you reveal and compare your result with the opponent, you can instead pay with a resource to "fold out of the conflict". This leaves the conflict unresolved for now and forces the other player to narrate the scene out without resolving the issue. In dramaturgical terms this equates to freezing the conflict, even as there is a clear distinction between the participants on who exactly decided to chicken out. The interesting bit is how the game semi-randomly encourages folding, as your motivation to fold depends on how good a hand you happened to draw.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469848/#Comment_469848" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-09T13:39:15+00:00" title="February  9, 2018  1:39PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Basic questions I think need to be asked:\n<ul><li>Creative Agenda: specifically, your example sounds like people are, in a way, "playing to win".

This often is this wordless acknowedgement even, because in my group everyone is strongly on the same page. <br/>When there's two different scenes involving different characters going on that in-universe are happening at the same time, we cut back and forth between them at dramatic high points (or just generally whenever everyone feels like it's appropriate). <br/>We do a lot of very cinematic-y framing at times also, describing specific shots that would exist in a movie, tv show, or animated series or the like. <br/>So basically my answer to how I handle stuff is just that we kind of have an agreement as part of the social contract of how we play, and the pseudo-unspoken rules of scene framing and scene cutting are a big part of that social contract.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469881/#Comment_469881" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-10T09:31:14+00:00" title="February 10, 2018  9:31AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2018 12:17PM by DeReel.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I come to the same conclusion.

A vampire that is about the dig in to another character is best cut before it is fully resolved. Later scenes can show the consequences of that action.<br/><br/>A scene is better if people cut whenever they need to start thinking of what's going to happen next.<br/><br/>A scene is better if each scene before had a short discussion about it.<br/><br/>A scene is better if someone has a goal with it, and states that goal. It doesn't have to be something that is resolved. A thought would do, like "What would happen if Daenarys and John Snow met?". Focus on questions, instead of stating goals that says what will happen.<br/><br/>A scene is better if someone is eager to play it out, even if it's the same person that sets up all the scenes.

Any scene that are created with "That gives the others something to work with in future scenes, or /.../ understand that character's motifs and actions.", or more things I can't think of right now, wont follow under that kind of rule.<br/><br/>If I try to explain this with other words: some scenes are there to set up the plot (ex. the inner monologue example), while others are resolving them (ex. cut after conflict) ... given that you play to solve conflicts. That's not always the case.<br/><br/>You need establishing scenes to set up the plot. In my experience, just rushing for conflicts creates a story that no one is invested in. Me and some fellow roleplaying gamers came to this conclusion after analyzing botched sessions (i.e. resulting in bad stories) in games that already given us really good sessions (meaning, for this time, good stories).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470227/#Comment_470227" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-26T12:09:00+00:00" title="February 26, 2018 12:09PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> "just rushing for conflicts creates a story that no one is invested in." Very important remark about the "conflict oriented scenes" here. My answer to this problem is : not always (begin "in medias res" is perfect iff everybody feels like improv -ing their heads off) ; most of all, it's not a problem anymore if you begin with higher level (thematic) conflicts. <br/>On the contrary, I prefer to rush on the thematic conflicts so everybody is on board very soon with the various thematic options, leaving the main ones open until the climax.

When a question is answered, the scene ends \u2013 that's your cut point.<br/><br/>So how do you mechanize that? How do you get players to agree on what question is being asked at the start of a scene, so that everyone knows when it's been answered, thus ending the scene naturally?<br/><br/>Another way to think of it: Every character in a scene has a goal (likely a single step that's part of a larger goal). The scene ends when a character definitively achieves or fails at their goal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470450/#Comment_470450" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-07T06:34:57+00:00" title="March  7, 2018  6:34AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Out of character agreement is an easy way of getting this. Drama system, Primetime Adventure, Annalise, Capes. This is neat for improv style play in general, giving clear boundaries allows to immerse. It is a bit artificial for storytelling play.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
