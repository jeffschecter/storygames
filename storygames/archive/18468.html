Finally decided to actually become a contributing member and share some of my own ideas here. The first of which is a Skin I developed. It is based off of Sun Wukong and as such has more of an Eastern flavor. In the setting of Monsterhearts it represents the youth who will do anything for attention. The one who has to be the best and brightest star driven by an insecure ego. Self destructive, wild, and chaotic.<br/><br/>Sounds like a perfect fit to me. Let me know what you think.<br/><br/><b>The Monkey Prince</b><br/><br/><i>Even the humblest of creatures can shake the pillars of Heaven. None know this like the Monkey Prince. Coming from the humblest of beginnings the Monkey Prince is never satisfied being second best. Never content simply to be. Always driven to greater heights and always willing to show it off.<br/><br/>Brash and foolhardy the Prince will challenge the gods themselves till they acknowledge him as their equal. And nothing earns the Monkey Prince's wrath quite like paying lip service to his greatness. Pretend to acknowledge him and he will wage war against you.</i><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Playing the Monkey Prince</span><br/><br/>You are reckless and wild as the being you are modeled after. Good food, fine wine, beautiful song, and sultry women are your treasures. You are destined for greatness and you know it. The Monkey Prince is a braggart and a showoff. He doesn't walk when he can swagger. If someone else jumps he does a backflip.<br/><br/>Go into Darkest Self when you gain the condition <i>Pissed Off</i> and your Ego has 5+ Strings on you.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Darkest Self</span><br/><br/>How dare they talk down to you?! You are the Monkey Prince! Heir to the Handsome Monkey King who humbled Heaven itself! Push them until they can't hide who they really are. Push their buttons until they snap and throw everything out of balance. Teach them why they should never condescend to you.<br/><br/>Come out of Darkest Self when someone acknowledges your greatness or after 1 brash, Ego driven act per String his Ego has on him.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sex Move</span><br/><br/>Even in bed the Monkey Prince's ego reigns supreme. After the Monkey Prince has sex with someone if they praise his abilities he gains a String on them. If they stay silent his Ego gains a String on him. If they disparage his skills he gains the condition <i>pissed off.</i><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stats</span><br/><br/>Add 1 to one of: Hot 1, Cold -1, Volatile 1, Dark -1<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Names</span><br/><br/>An arrogant name, a buddhist name, a Chinese name<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Look</span><br/><br/>Cocky, virile, energetic, athletic, glorious<br/><br/>Mischievous eyes, bold eyes, smiling eyes, shameless eyes, brilliant eyes<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Telltale</span><br/><br/>Monkey tail, mane, monkey feet, fangs, furry chest<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Origin</span><br/><br/>Born from a stone, enlightened tree dweller, heir of the Monkey King, graced by a buddha, taught the sacred sutras<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Monkey Prince Moves</span><br/><br/>Choose this move and 1 other.<br/><br/>* <b>Equal of Heaven:</b> The Monkey Prince has begged, cajoled, and stolen magic from it's rightful wielders. Be they holy men, demons, or even gods. Every piece of that power fuels his Ego. Reinforces how amazing he is in his own eyes and driving him to greater acts of rashness.<br/><br/>In game terms every time the Monkey Prince wields a Gift his Ego gains a String on him. It also makes him vulnerable to manipulation. Whenever he feels truly slighted the Monkey Prince gains the condition <i>Pissed Off</i> and his Ego gains a String on him. <br/><br/>In addition pick 2 Gifts.<br/><br/>- <b>Stone Monkey:</b> The strength of Sun Wukong is legendary and his children can wield it too. When you <i>lash out physically</i> deal 1 extra Harm.<br/><br/>- <b>Cloud Traveling:</b> Few can match the acrobatic abilities of a scion of Sun Wukong. Able to leap great distances with only an effortless smile. The Monkey Prince can leap 5 times his own height up and ten times in distance. This also gives him a +2 to <i>run away</i>.<br/><br/>- <b>The Handsome Monkey Prince:</b> Claim responsibility for something audacious. If you believe your claims and someone else validates them, mark XP. If you both know you aren't responsible, gain a String on each other.*<br/><br/>- <b>Shining Brilliance:</b> Whenever you have an audience for a fight carry 1 forward as long as you do not fail a roll. If you fail a roll your Ego gains a String on you.<br/><br/>- <b>Audacious Monkey:</b> Gain a +2 <i>to manipulate an npc</i> when convincing them to teach you a secret.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gifts</span><br/><br/>- <b>Trickster:</b> Illusion is a favored Trick of the Monkey Prince. With this art you may either grant another person the condition of <i>Monkey King Impostor</i> making them resemble you or yourself the condition of <i>Great Impersonator</i> and resemble one person who you can see. Both last till sunset or sunrise. Whichever comes first. Add +1 to your roll if the person you are impersonating or if the person impersonating you is in on the joke.<br/><br/>- <b>The 84000:</b> Each of the Monkey Prince's hairs can become an object of his request. Within reason. Nothing living, only simple tools, and nothing larger than than a man. So a bicycle is cool but a gun or a computer is not.<br/><br/>- <b>Part the Waters:</b> The Monkey Prince can part or command water. Capable of sinking or raising objects no larger than a speedboat.<br/><br/>- <b>Command the Air:</b> Like your namesake you know spells to command the wind itself. This allows you to <b>to lash out physically</b> from a distance no greater than 5 times your height.<br/><br/>- <b>Protective Sutras:</b> You know the secrets of protecting yourself and others from demons. If the Monkey Prince has time to prepare he can sanctify a circle that will make any demon (up to MC) be at a <i>disadvantage</i> while in it.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Backstory</span><br/><br/>You wear your heart on your sleeve. <i>Give a String to everyone.</i><br/><br/>Someone has been impressed by you. <i>Gain 2 Strings on them.</i><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advancements</span><br/><br/>\x81\x81 Take another Monkey Prince move.<br/>\x81\x81 Take the remaining Gifts.<br/>\x81\x81 Create a new Gift (MC approval).<br/>\x81\x81 Take a move from another Skin.<br/>\x81\x81 Take a move from another Skin.<br/>\x81\x81 You belong to a <i>Congress of Rebels</i>.<br/>\x81\x81 Add 1 to Hot (max 3).<br/>\x81\x81 Add 1 to Cold (max 3).<br/>\x81\x81 Add 1 to Volatile (max 3).<br/>\x81\x81 Add 1 to Dark (max 3).<br/><br/>*Rework of the Handsome Monkey Prince move provided by Cneph.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/makrdp" title="makrdp"><img alt="makrdp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/makrdp">makrdp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415910/#Comment_415910" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-10T12:32:30+00:00" title="June 10, 2013 12:32PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2013 12:32PM by makrdp.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see how the gifts would be useful for an Exalted game, or even your standard D&amp;D-style murder-hobo wandering, but they don't map very well to Monsterheart's setting (with the exception of the 1st gift's possibility for hijinks).

They are modeled off the Hexes and Bargains of the Witch and Infernal respectively. Admittedly this is only the rough draft of the Skin so flaws are to be expected. <br/><br/>Hmm... perhaps an addition to the non-mechanical gifts to provoke a social interaction or response. I could work that in. Provide an additional Move or two based around interaction and it might balance out well.<br/><br/>Thank you, makrdp.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415923/#Comment_415923" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-10T15:44:40+00:00" title="June 10, 2013  3:44PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2013 3:45PM by James_Mullen.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like this, it's an audacious concept, but I think I can see what makrdp means: for example, the Gifts are cool, but unlike Hexes, there's no price or risk associated with them. For a Witch to work a Hex on someone, they first have to have a token of their target's, then they have to roll to make the Hex work; the Gift's here are just automatic bonuses, with no hardship or downside involved. Since they reflect stolen magics, maybe there should add an additional penalty or choice on a 7-9? For example, <b>Command the Air</b> lets you <b>lash out</b> at a distance, but on a 7-9, perhaps the MC can also choose one additional target of that move, caught in the backlash of your attack.<br/><br/>The move I'd be most concerned about is <b>The Handsome Monkey Prince</b>, which looks like it earns you XP when the MC or another player says so: the Monkey player has little to no control over it. I think it needs rewording to give the player greater agency over when they make that move, instead of relying on someone else to trigger it for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadmanshand" title="deadmanshand"><img alt="deadmanshand" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadmanshand">deadmanshand</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415925/#Comment_415925" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-10T16:16:32+00:00" title="June 10, 2013  4:16PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Gifts have a drawback. They give the Ego Strings on the Monkey Prince. Giving the MC more room to push him and manipulate him. The more Strings the Ego has on him the more likely the Monkey Prince is to snap. At least that's my thought process. I really need to actually play test this Skin to see how it actually works.<br/><br/>Actually I just need to actually get to play the game for more than 6 seconds at a time.<br/><br/>The Handsome Monkey Prince does need some thought on my part. I think my original wary-ness of letting him proc his own xp is a hold back to more traditional games where you would never give anyone the ability to just give themselves experience. I may have to adjust this way of thinking for MH.<br/><br/>Thanks, James.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415926/#Comment_415926" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-10T16:36:03+00:00" title="June 10, 2013  4:36PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yes, of course, the Ego:  I would like to see that in play, it would be an interesting contrast to the Infernal's Bargains.<br/><br/>Cool ideas, deadman. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415929/#Comment_415929" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-10T17:45:02+00:00" title="June 10, 2013  5:45PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Random thought- something more proactive might be along the lines of "Claim responsibility for something audacious.

It's a bit different from the usual slant Monsterhearts Skins take, which makes it bold and appealing but also a challenge to design.<br/><br/>I also find the Gifts/moves rather uninteresting, as several people have said. I feel that things like incredible athleticism or the ability to produce objects from your hair are really just colour, just gloss, in a game of Monsterhearts. Like: we all know the Werewolf is physically impressive, fast, and strong, so we roleplay accordingly. We don't need special moves and bonuses to show that. The best moves, in contrast, model and/or create interesting interactions between characters. When I read through the Skin, the new move ("Claim responsibility...") was the only one which jumped out at me, because it seems like it would actually do that in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415978/#Comment_415978" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-11T08:23:07+00:00" title="June 11, 2013  8:23AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!

The Queen).<br/><br/>More broadly, I agree with Paul about creating Skins by looking at how the moves and gifts create messy teenage monster situations, and less about cool stunts that are almost just colour.  That's where my move suggestion came from- it is intended to encourage the Monkey Scion (and even other characters) to create or just encourage audacious happenings in game.  (This is why the trigger isn't "Make an audacious claim").  The drama comes from claiming responsibility, and how you get people to back you up.  Win-win for everyone.<br/><br/>While I'm pleased people like the new move, it was an off-the-cuff suggestion and I think it needs work.  On reflection, it would work more clearly in play if the second trigger was rewritten, something like this:<br/><br/>"Claim responsibility for something audacious. If you believe your claims and someone else validates them, mark XP.  If they know you aren't responsible, you each take a String on the other."<br/><br/>That way one or both effects can trigger, cleanly, without the original wordings grey areas, around what happens when you are deluded but they know the falsehood of your claims.  It also ties in better with 'paying lip service' from the intro text.  Note, both characters gaining a string does strongly imply the Monkey Scion instinctively knows when the acknowledgment is false.  Whether the balance of strings is right, and will encourage other players to back up your false claims, I don't know- requires playtesting.<br/><br/>Edited for typos and clarity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416034/#Comment_416034" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-11T20:50:19+00:00" title="June 11, 2013  8:50PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2013 8:51PM by Cneph.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It would also be nice for the Ego to be able to gain a string somewhere here too, perhaps when you believe you are responsible, but really aren't, and get puffed up by praise.  Perhaps an element of choice, either believe their 'praise' and give your Ego a String, or give a string to the other person.  Maybe something like...<br/><br/>... If you really aren't responsible, choose:  Believe their flattery and give your Ego a String on you, or suspect their motives and you each take a String on the other.<br/><br/>But, there is no mechanical incentive to choose the Ego string.  Like I say, the balance of incentives needs work, even if I think the basic move premise is sound.  I'd almost want to tie the Ego string in to marking XP when someone backs up your claim (stroking your ego), but that might make the move too weak, mechanically.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadmanshand" title="deadmanshand"><img alt="deadmanshand" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadmanshand">deadmanshand</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416039/#Comment_416039" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-11T23:41:04+00:00" title="June 11, 2013 11:41PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All this feedback is great.
