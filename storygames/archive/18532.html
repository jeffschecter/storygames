Despite himself, Gonsalvo murmurs aloud that this is the most gorgeous man he has ever seen. Whether Honor\xe9 heard this unintended utterance, or whether it was simply his manner, Honor\xe9 frowned further and turned to leave the room. Maria, Honor\xe9's caring maidservant, had left by this point to prepare Gonsalvo's bedroom, but had neglected to tell him where it is. Taking it upon himself to find his room, Gonsalvo begins to explore the house by himself, only to get hopelessly lost and stumble across an increasingly frustrated Maria, who now has more work to do, and has of course seen the way that this young man looks at her beloved master. She directs him to his room, and instructs him to get out of those filthy rags he's wearing. There are clothes set aside for him. Unfortunately, these clothes are somewhat too tight, because, as Honor\xe9 indicates over dinner, he had been expecting a child, rather than a young man. They'll have to go down tomorrow to get Gonsalvo some new clothes, more befitting his appearance. In the absence of Olivier, Maria's un-practiced hands were pouring the wine that night, and she took this opportunity to make her distaste felt by spilling a liberal portion all over Gonsalvo. Honor\xe9 raises an eybrow in suspicion, getting his first inkling that something might be up with Maria.<br/><br/>- - -<br/>So, we're playing a three player game of <i>Hot Guys Making Out</i>. This round, I played Gonsalvo, A. played Honor\xe9, and T. played Maria.<br/><br/>In this first scene, aside from the initial awkwardness of learning any new game, we ran into one big problem. Every single ace was drawn in the first hand. Try as we might, we couldn't figure out how to escalate Maria's jealousy to the point where it could potentially kill a character in the very first scene. It just don't follow from the rhythm and structure of play that we had established. I don't know if Ben can speak to this, but it does seem odd for an anomaly like that to bring the game to a grinding halt. In any case, after some deliberation, we decided to end the scene, reshuffle the cards, and keep going. After that initial hiccup, we had a lovely game!<br/>- - -<br/><br/>Perhaps it was the wine that made his head spin, or perhaps it was Honor\xe9, but in either case, Gonsalvo was unable to sleep. He decided to go exploring through the house again, and successfully makes his way to Honor\xe9's study. The lights are on, and through the crack of the door it appears that Honor\xe9 has been drinking. Maria is up late as well and as she walks past, she snipes at Gonsalvo, asking him if he has anything better to do than creep around late at night. She's still working, and putting in twice as much effort now, to please her master. She's got a massive load of Gonsalvo's laundry and bedsheets that need cleaning. Honor\xe9, hearing the noise outside, draws open the door and, seeing Gonsalvo, asks him in, pouring more wine for the two of them. He's been looking over old photo albums, and he asks Gonsalvo if he would like to see pictures of his father when they were boys. It seems that Honor\xe9 and Gonsalvo's fathers knew each other from relatively young ages, and were very close. In a spur of the moment, Gonsalvo takes the lead, and asks if they could take a walk through the garden together. Maria, somewhat belligerently, insists that it might still rain, and Honor\xe9 will be in need of her services to hold the umbrella. Deftly plucking the umbrella from her grasp, Honor\xe9 tells her that if there should be rain, there will really only be room for two underneath, and he should prefer to hold Gonsalvo close. Just before Gonsalvo leaves, Maria manages to give him a small piece of back-handed advice, that if he wants to catch Honor\xe9's attention, he'll have to start dressing much better than this. As they leave, they talk, and Honor\xe9 begins to open up, telling stories of his childhood here.<br/><br/>Maria, in a fury, storms off, doing her duties in a huff. In the kitchen, she mutters something about how someone aught to keep an eye on those two. One of the cooks, a large, surly, deeply conservative man, catches an inkling of what she is referring to, and stalks off into the night.<br/><br/>Back in the garden, Gonsalvo has spotted a large, Adonis-like statue in bronze, and runs off to go take a look at it. He bumps into a large chef, who indicates that he is keeping an eye on the boy before disappearing deeper into the darkness. Unsettled by the incident, but still very much in the moment, Gonsalvo and Honor\xe9 stand and watch the statue as its curves are illuminated briefly in the moonlight, and Honor\xe9 gestures to the classical angles of its construction with his umbrella.<br/><br/>- - -<br/>Our Honor\xe9 turned out to be a slightly debauched character, and it became something of a running joke that no matter where he was, there would always be a glass of booze somewhere within reach. A future Threat is almost definitely going to be Honor\xe9's Alcoholism (&amp; Guilt). A. struggled to make Honor\xe9 passionate and decisive without being creepy, and so there were a lot of sudden stops to clarify somewhat untoward turns of phrases (like that he'd expected Gonsalvo to be younger, for example). Speaking about the game afterwards, A. explained that they'd imagined Honor\xe9 as the sort of person who would catch feelings later, and that you'd get the sense that Gonsalvo might not be his first. As much as I get the nod to yaoi, I really don't think the art here helps with the matter at all. Gonsalvo looks like he is 12, with Honor\xe9 definitely closer to 30 than 20. I found myself working really hard as Gonsalvo to defuse the creepiness by making his reactions extra genuine and sincere. And we made sure to decide that our Gonsalvo was definitely 18. That said, we did have a really productive conversation about the kind of fiction we were producing. It seems to exist within the simultaneously sincere and transgressive space as much slash-fic.<br/>- - -<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KirkMitchell" title="KirkMitchell"><img alt="KirkMitchell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KirkMitchell">KirkMitchell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416882/#Comment_416882" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T09:44:47+00:00" title="June 23, 2013  9:44AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2013 9:50AM by KirkMitchell.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Down in town, Maria and Honor\xe9 take Gonsalvo to the most expensive boutique there. Maria painstakingly picks out huge quantities of clothing, shoving them into Gonsalvo's arms to the point of him nearly toppling over. He is saved from the embarrassment by Honor\xe9 dipping in to catch him by the waist, telling him not to get too carried away. Shoved into a changing room, Gonsalvo manages to select an absolutely dashing outfit, but struggles with the tie. Honor\xe9, growing impatient, ducks in to see how Gonsalvo is doing, and helps him with the tie. This is witnessed by the boutique owner, who notes that it should rightly be the job of their body-servant, not the master, to be helping the young man with his clothes. Noticing Maria's obvious annoyance elsewhere in the shop, eyebrows begin to be raised. The rumour-mill starts. To make matters even worse, emboldened by this gesture of affection, Gonsalvo suddenly grasps Honor\xe9's hand and runs out into the store, declaring that if he got some new clothes, Honor\xe9 should have something equally handsome. They run their hands over the silk ties together, fingers briefly touching, as the sun dips down to shine golden light briefly through the window. Witnessing this rather beautiful scene, Maria begins to feel a touch of doubt about her own feelings.<br/><br/>- - -<br/>This scene was the first one to really come together from start to finish. We especially enjoyed the way in which the scene ends when everyone has passed, which means that each scene ends with a beautiful descriptive denouement. The silk ties in golden hour was awesome.<br/>- - -<br/><br/>On the way back, there is some car trouble, which Honor\xe9 deals with gracefully, and Gonsalvo fails at utterly. Taking the opportunity to show up the helpless brat, Maria slides under the car with Honor\xe9, handing him the correct tools and taking the opportunity to tell him that she thinks he looks quite handsome in his new clothing. Honor\xe9, while always happy to receive compliments, suddenly feels somewhat uncomfortable and claustrophobic in these close confines. Quickly ducking out from under the car, he throws his tools aside, and declares this to be peasant work, and says that they will walk. Gonsalvo, leaning against the car to watch Honor\xe9, accidentally knocks the car off its jack, narrowly missing Maria. Furious and terrified, Maria berates Gonsalvo and runs ahead to flag down a car. Having a moment alone, Honor\xe9 suddenly kisses Gonsalvo on the lips. When it ends, Gonsalvo says to Honor\xe9 that he is very much looking forward to getting to know him, and they walk together hand in hand. Gonsalvo tells him about his time in the orphanage.<br/><br/>Maria, turning back briefly, witnesses them kissing, silhouetted against the glow of the sun, now just set beyond the horizon, and feels utterly foolish and low, too depressed now to feel any anger or jealousy. As she returns to walking, she sights the glow of headlights coming up over a hill.<br/><br/>Packed together tightly into the small country truck, Gonsalvo winds up in Honor\xe9\u2019s lap, and their eyes flicker over each other and the corn fields alongside them as they drive home.<br/><br/>- - -<br/>All in all, this was a beautiful game. A rocky start, but when it ended, we were all absolutely pumped to play again. It plays surprisingly quickly, and we were done in about an hour and a half, all told. We've already got a short list of future threats (the rumour mill gets out of hand) and potential scene starters (the air raid siren goes off), and can see this story really reaching some serious dramatic heights. As it stands, it was a sweet little story, gentle and compassionate. So thanks for making this game, Ben! It seriously rocks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
