So let's talk about banter!  I love banter, my game crew does too.  Here is the JDCorley method of promoting good banter at the table. I'm normally the GM, so I do a lot of this stuff, but many of these techniques are useful as a player too:<br/><br/>1.  The best, the best, the BEST banter is not just witty and/or snarky, it comes from the <i>convictions of the character</i>.  This is why I dislike Joss Whedon banter so much of the time - a lot of it is just sarcasm, and that doesn't really tell me a lot about what a character feels about the situation or person they're talking about.  So a prerequisite to good banter is knowing how you feel about the subject of the banter.  It doesn't have to be sophisticated, but the best banter comes from how your character feels about something and expresses how you feel about that something, even if it's just "I wanna get laid" or "they're stupid".<br/><br/>Let's see an example.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqoxk3SrZRw" rel="nofollow">You begin to interest me...vaguely.</a>  This classic 1946 banter from The Big Sleep is pretty simple.  Marlowe wants the girl to give him information and let him stake out the place across the street. The bookshop owner gets excited, she wants to get laid, so now she's flirting.  The best part is when she describes the fellow Marlowe is looking for, very obviously sizing up Marlowe himself.  "Fattish," she muses, looking down. Marlowe sucks in his stomach suddenly.  <br/><br/>So the first prerequisite to good banter is knowing how your character feels and approaches the subject of the banter.<br/><br/>2.  The greatest banter has <i>a setup</i>.  The setup is a straight line, where a character clearly expresses what they think, perhaps even going a little too far.  Banter is normally cutting, deprecating of someone or something, so the best setup is, conversely, a little overblown, a little "too much".<br/><br/>Example: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1f6Xc3PsOkc" rel="nofollow">Why you...</a><br/><br/>The reason Han's response to Leia works is because she is pissed off at him, and "protests too much".  If Leia had been more down-to-earth, so to speak, in her criticisms, the banter wouldn't have worked, because we would have taken her critique of Han seriously and seen him as a bit of a blowhard to blow her off. When she goes over the top with a dude who has saved her and Luke more than once, she sets herself up to be taken down a notch.  <br/><br/>Another great thing to watch in this scene is how the actors convey what's going on. Carrie Fisher raises her voice, she looks him up and down (and up and down), while Harrison Ford can barely keep from rolling his eyes, he takes a big deep breath and....<br/><br/>3.  <i>The pause.</i>  The fact is that pauses in conversation are, in the mind of the person whose turn it is to talk, magnified in size ten times or a hundred. In the above clip, it's a full four seconds from when she says the word "scruffy" to when he turns back with his retort, and a full two seconds between when she finishes yelling and when he replies.  Yet in our minds and in our memory, this banter is "fast", we give Han credit for wit in this situation even though in the mind of the character, the pause might be enormous.  When you've got an opportunity for banter served up for you, stop and shut your mouth a moment, formulate your reply, then volley back!<br/><br/>4.  All-Purpose Retorts.  These are retorts that can be pre-prepared for many situations.  For example, what might be a simple "Hell no!" becomes, in the mouth of Black Adder <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLybS4jKSCE" rel="nofollow">"How hurt would you be by my real answer, which is 'I'd rather french-kiss a skunk'?"</a>  Okay, so that's friggin' hilarious, but there's no reason to try to make that up on the spot. You should have a bunch of "Hell, yes!" and "Hell, no!" and maybe "Here we go again" responses cooked up in advance, and maybe even practiced, so that you can whip them out at a moment's notice.<br/><br/>Put your own banter ideas here, I will bring you more later.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305637/#Comment_305637" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-22T20:42:51+00:00" title="December 22, 2010  8:42PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD, you had me at The Big Sleep.<br/><br/>Great pointers, man.

Like, his character is a reckless showoff, and yours is a gloom-ridden fatalist; now you know that you can make up old arguments and war stories about the crazy stunt he pulled years ago, and he'll pick up that ball and run with it.  Figure out what values and ideals your characters share:  if you both hate pompous windbags, you can team up when the villain starts monologuing and totally go Statler and Waldorf on his ass.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305655/#Comment_305655" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T01:52:07+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  1:52AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool stuff, JD.<br/><br/>[Like +1]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305712/#Comment_305712" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T09:53:31+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  9:53AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Love the idea of pre preparing - and stealing from obscure movies (or movies that you know the other guy hasn't seen) - once had some cop banter where I said, "hey, you remember Chinatown.". The player had never seen Chinatown.  Later in the game, during the big climactic gunfight, he yelled out "I remember Chinatown, god damn it!"<br/><br/><br/>The leia-Han exchange is also the best example of "you're x, y, and z" / "who you calling z?" I can think of.  It's not just over-the-top, it also has has a self-effacing witty comeback built into it...  <br/>"you look pensive". "nah, I'm just thinking."<br/>Anybody have a recipe or mechanism for pitching and catching these sorts of straight lines?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
