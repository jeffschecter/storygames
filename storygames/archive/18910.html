While I know that Opt selection doesn't a character make, I'm really proud of the way my primary's Opts work together: Sly of Hand, Rich &amp; Dire, and Carrion Smirk. As you can guess, I am not playing the most proactive character, but I have ways to tease others into action so that I can lean back and prosper. It's a sneaky, fun build.<br/><br/>Now I'm trying to figure out a good alt character - and specifically one to support such a reactive, manipulative primary. The Entanglements are going to be easy (entangle with each impulsive primary and at least a couple alts), but the Opt selection step is a bit trickier. I love picking Opts, and have spent hours pouring over those glossy pages, but am unsure where I want to go with this character - I've never built an alt for such a reactive primary before.<br/><br/>There's this one Opt that is really nifty, but upon imagining it in play, I can't really conceive of its value/impact. I'm talking about Dagger Heart. It seems like there must be a combo, or set of combos, that make it shine. But the longer I stare at it, the less clear I am on how it's supposed to work in play.<br/><br/>So, yeah - what makes Dagger Heart a good Opt? How do you use it, what do you combine it with? And is there a way to build this alt around it?<br/><br/>Obviously I haven't said much about our campaign, or my primary character, or the rest of the cast. I didn't want to burden you with unnecessary details. Ask questions if you have them! Most of the other players of this campaign are on the forums too - feel free to jump in and tell others about our game if you'd like to. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422980/#Comment_422980" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-16T07:37:38+00:00" title="October 16, 2013  7:37AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, here's what I've been seeing so far, take it or leave it, because I don't have a complete insight into the Drive you've been setting up the last couple sessions.<br/><br/>A good alt has three things, in my mind. A strong main Opt, a versatile supporting Opt, and then it ties into a Layer that brings them into play at opportune times. You don't want to be hopping onto your alt every other scene, but you do want to pull the alt in to generate enough Forte on your primary. The alt doesn't take point, after all. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Dagger Heart is good for some people, because of how it leverages the Underscurry Layer into the campaign. The way you've been playing so far, I think you might particularly be one of those people--I think that's why the Puppetmaster suggested that you check it out. With Underscurry in play, I think you're going to hit that sweet spot with your alt, where they're not stealing dice from the main storyline, and where they're giving you enough Forte to be worth it.<br/><br/>Check the triggers on Dagger Heart, and don't forget that the PM's been hinting at a nemesis in the Underscurry in the very first session. The biggest problem with this Opt is how situational it can be, but I think everyone's onboard with it.<br/><br/>(Also, the synergy with Lily Blood shouldn't be overlooked. That's a fantastic supporting Opt. Don't neglect the less-flashy ones. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422981/#Comment_422981" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-16T07:56:04+00:00" title="October 16, 2013  7:56AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What are we talking about here?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422983/#Comment_422983" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-16T08:37:34+00:00" title="October 16, 2013  8:37AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Dagger Heart is good for some people, because of how it leverages the Underscurry Layer into the campaign.

Since play moves through different Layers, it seemed like such a hit-or-miss way to build a character. But for an alt, that makes perfect sense. Okay, Dagger Heart makes a lot more sense now.<br/><br/>While the synergy you point out between Dagger Heart and Lily Blood is cool (and creates a martyr complex that my primary could react to with juicy indignity!), I don't know that it makes sense to dedicate two of my Opts to this one combo. It's cool, but it's resource intensive and case-specific. Unless I'm missing yet another cool trick with these weirdo Opts?

I'm not sure where the PM for the game found it. Like Joe said, open to more specific questions, though I haven't read through the full rules comprehensively yet. I probably should; there's just a lot of interesting character options.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/TildeSee">@TildeSee</a>, there's still some helpful benefits to the alt conversation, even if you disavow them in general. It gets you thinking about Layers even in the Opening, which helps gear you up for when they emerge in full a few sessions later.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">@Mcdaldno</a>: Yeah; the more I look at everything, the more I see that there's a lot of tight writing in the game. As for the Lily Blood combo--well, my one weakness has always been giving a character a strong focus. I admit that it's a better idea to stay versatile, but I just can't stop thinking about the incredible blaze-of-glory dramatic nova that happens when you get the stars to align <i>just right</i>. If you play your cards well, you can keep the situation under enough control to nudge things towards that one gripping moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422995/#Comment_422995" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-16T11:25:08+00:00" title="October 16, 2013 11:25AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dagger Heart + Flight of Glass = Forte engine, if that's your thing.

By not generating an alt, as Carpe says, you really leave the rest of the troupe weak at leveraging the Layers accumulated when Crescendo hits.

Moving between primary and alt is fun. And knowing that the system will support you even when your primary character doesn't is really cool - so many trad games say "make the wrong choices during character creation and you'll suffer in play." <i>Dawn Crescent</i> does something new. It says "your choices matter and have weight, but the system won't punish you for building the type of character that you're interested in." When you build an unhinged aggressor (with Opts like Lucifer, Ragged Bullet, and Flight of Glass) or a distracting lure (with Opts like Banner, Lily Blood, and Missing Shadow), the game won't punish you with a waggling finger for forgetting to pick some healing Opts. Instead, it'll high-five you for your interesting choices and provide you with opportunities to fill in the skill-gaps as you play.<br/><br/>Alt characters are a big part of that dynamic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423021/#Comment_423021" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-16T17:11:36+00:00" title="October 16, 2013  5:11PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 16, 2013 5:12PM by Johnstone.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Link is broken Joe.

It's just one of those games where only skimming the rules is not an option, and in fact several read-throughs (with notes) would be preferable- seems to be a game aimed strictly at the 'hardcore'.<br/><br/>Then again, having such broad ability to create new combos, and play the abilities of your Primary off of your Alt (in appropriate Layers, of course)...just having such a wide open/interestingly constrained mechanical space to play in...may really end up putting the need to engage with the community, to share tricks, tips, and exploits, front and center. Getting the most out of your experience with Dawn Crescent will necessary involve talking with others (especially those outside of your home group) about it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423026/#Comment_423026" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-16T20:15:21+00:00" title="October 16, 2013  8:15PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dagger Heart is a bullshit n00b opt.

I love the shininess of Feats/Powers/Moves - legitimately love it. I've spent a lot of time pouring over Magic card spoilers, Warmachine faction books, Anima Prime powers, and the like. It's fun.<br/><br/>I like talking about Powers and curious combinations - in a way that I don't like talking about dice curves or complex token economies. And so I decided to play pretend about such a conversation. I had a little joy squeal when I read CarpeGuitarrem's quick response. I like talking about games that don't exist, because it gives rise to actual good game design ideas. ((designing an alternate character for the Underscurry Layer sounds amazing, and now I want to figure out what that even means.)) The play-pretend petered out, as it does. I was less excited about the posts that mocked conversational style (with "n00b" accusations and spitting-teen-boy style), but everyone has a different way of playing along.<br/><br/>I would totally fawn over <i>Dawn Crescendo</i> if I knew what the fuck it was.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee" title="TildeSee"><img alt="TildeSee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee">TildeSee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423201/#Comment_423201" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-20T00:27:34+00:00" title="October 20, 2013 12:27AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since I think I kinda kicked off the "poking fun at tone" thing, I think I should own up that I was equal parts mocking the way I myself talk about games and seeing if my own Edition Warrior kit still fit.

I love the way the design lets you learn about that complexity progressively, starting without an alt and only building them as you develop experience with the game.
