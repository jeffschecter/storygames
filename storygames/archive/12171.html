All I really want is a burning wheel with "Burningcast" over it. If you are interested in helping us out let me know and we will give you a shout out on our first episode! <br/><br/>We are also looking for interviews with players in general and BW GMs. If you would be interested in coming on the show and talking about your experience playing games or running BW we would love to have you on. Also if you play with a player who to you exemplifies what it means to you to be a good player we would love to interview them as well! <br/><br/>We will also be looking around the boards for fun new LPs, settings and hacks. If you have a hack, setting or LP that you are particularly proud of let us know and we will either feature it on the show or have you on to talk about it. We are also looking to answer your BW questions the best we can so if you have a question you would like us to cover on the show ask it here or email me jmhpfan at gmail dot com. <br/><br/>Any comments or questions about the show can be left here or sent to my email. We hope to have the show up and running in a few weeks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272625/#Comment_272625" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T11:53:46+00:00" title="May 23, 2010 11:53AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It probably goes without saying, but you should make sure Luke is cool with you using the BW logo.

We had two mice: a fascistic patrol leader called Sloan, who put the good of the mission above the needs of individual mice, he was quite ruthless, to say the least, and we had Neville, his idealistic tenderpaw later promoted to guardmouse. I played the latter while Chearns played the former. Anadiel was our GM. There was another player, as well, Cedric, who played Brynn, a kind of mother figure, but he didn't get the game as much (though he also later became a fan of Burning Wheel). As the story went on, Sloan became more sympathetic, and Neville became darker, and more than a little hypocritical : his Belief didn't seem to hold the pressure so much. However, we didn't bring the game to its conclusion, so there's no telling where this might have gone. In any case, it was a very strong play experience for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd be happy to come to the show, and I would recomment any of my fellow players as well. However, I'm going on vacation, and won't be available until August.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272644/#Comment_272644" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T13:56:26+00:00" title="May 23, 2010  1:56PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Talk about Under a Serpent Sun!
