                    From <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1960&amp;page=1#Comment_46002" rel="nofollow">What don't you understand?</a>
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>1) I don't understand why it's so much fun to design a character. I mean, JUST sitting and fiddling with characters without any immediate intent to play them, maybe not even any<i>eventual</i>intent. It's not so fun in, like, Dogs or PTA, which are for sure geared for<i>playing</i>the characters, period. But in D&amp;D, GURPS/Champs/BESM, etc? Oh yeah.<br/></blockquote>
I was reading through the D&amp;D Players Handbook because I'm going to be running it for a friend who's interested, and by the time I had finished the Races and Classes section I had designed two characters, and was tempted to design two more.<br/><br/>Granted, ONE of them was in fact designed from a "I want to play this guy" standpoint. A character that could only truly be observed/experienced <i>in motuion,</i> as it were. But the other char ideas were just, y'know, fiddling with different classes and feats and spells and stuff.<br/><br/>No matter how much I get digging the "fit characters in rising conflict across a moral line" thing, I'm still a sucker for tinkering with a character like a car engine, not even to race it, just to, y'know, tinker.<br/><br/>I can think of a couple of possibly-relevant factors:<br/><br/>1) The "sitting alone with your gamebooks" phenomenon. If you buy and read roleplaying books at a greater rate than you get to play (particularly, get to try <i>new</i> games), there's likely to be an itch created by a given new game text that can only be scratched at present by fiddling with Chargen. Given the "One campaign, <i>ad perpetuam</i>" model that many gaming groups follow, this is especially likely--trying a new game means interrupting <i>the</i> Game. Even trying new options within the <i>same</i> (published) system, like a new race/class/feat combo, is infeasible because you've already <i>got</i> your character, and you'd have to get him killed or something to open up a slot for a new one.<br/><br/>2) The joy of tinkering itself. . .the same impulse that led me to take apart every toy I owned that had screws in it, when I was 10.<br/><br/>3) Because play itself isn't so satisfying, but character building is. Kind of like fantasizing about your dream girl is less risky than calling her up. This could be because the game rules you're using don't support bringing out the interestingness of your character in play, or it could just be because you're not good at it/nobody understands you/whatever.<br/><br/>Any thoughts? Does this resonate with anyone? Any profound conclusions to draw from the phenomenon? Are there problems to be fixed here, or opportunities to be exploited, or both?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                </div>

                            Joel, I think you're overthinking it. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>In a lot of games, character creation is fun in and of itself, because among other things, it was designed to be fun.  If you've ever played <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> or its latter-day incarnation <em>After the Bomb</em>, character creation is actually more fun than running adventures.  There's nothing wrong with that, or any dysfunction to diagnose.  Making up pretend people, especially when they have super powers or live in some exciting and over-the-top setting, is fun.  It's just the RPG equivalent of doodling superheroes.                        </div>

Hah, that's an awesome way of putting it.<br/><br/>Makes a lot of sense. I didn't have TMNT, but I had Heroes of Limited, with the Animal Mutation rules grafted in.  And yeah, some of the characters you'd come up with were dog-shit awful to play ("I've got a homeless mutant cat named Fluffy!" "I made an insectoid alien! He's, uh, got a bazooka!"), but sitting down and plotting out the mutation stages, or spending your cybernetics budget, or building an A-team style super-vehicle (we made so many ugly-ass flying cars with welded on armor plate and gun turrets), was totally engrossing. So yeah, overthinking is totally a possibility. Maybe I'm just concerned that I'm <i>still</i> doing it at age 31. Oh wait, I still doodle superheroes too. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>

                            I think of that stuff, and of the GM worldbuilding elements, as the equivalent of model railroading. Usually the goal in that hobby isn't ever to be finished; it's to be engaged in the project.                        </div>

                            Last time I was at my parent's I found a notebook from my teens in which I had done the stats for every single Marvel and DC character in Hero System Stats. <br/><br/>This was from a period in which I didn't play Hero System anymore. <br/><br/>And yet I remember it fondly. The combination of reverse engineering and fiddling to create my perfect version of the characters, ah... that was a game in and of itself.                        </div>

                            I believe I've seen such parts of RPGs referred to as "solitaire play" on the Forge. Because, yeah, despite much RPG-culture indoctrination that "play" is only the part where everyone is sitting down together getting in-character or whatever, a lot of the ancillary tasks like elaborate character creation or GM world-building are really mini-games in their own right. And maybe they're solitaire games because you're not doing them with other people (yet), but they can certainly be a valid form of entertainment and fun, if you're into that.<br/><br/>See also the term "gearhead."<br/><br/>Also, I nominate Traveller as the champion of this tendency among all RPGs. Entire sector generation and space trader games you can amuse yourself with independently of the RPG as a whole. Why do you think your character can get killed before he's even finished being created? Character creation is just assumed to be a part of gameplay.<br/><br/>I know I once made a whole fucking super-team with <i>Heroes Unlimited</i>/<i>Ninjas &amp; Supserspies</i> as a teen, complete with statted-out trailer-HQ a la Knight Rider, that never once saw light of SIS.                        </div>

                            The allure is partially rules-optimizing, and partially that I've never wanted my RPG hobby to be a 6pm-10pm, Saturday evening hobby.<br/><br/>When I played Warhammer, I'd spend countless time configuring my army. If I removed shields from this squad, I could afford another two huntsmen. Armour of the Meteor? Two hand weapons or a great weapon?<br/><br/>Part of it was that I was heavily invested (personally, but also monetarily) in Warhammer. I played every two weeks on average, but that wasn't enough. I wanted to be playing Warhammer when I couldn't sleep at 1am on a Tuesday morning. And, so, I'd tweak armies. I had an Empire militia list, a cannon-themed list, a cavalry themed list, a Kislev Contingent list. I made lists for other armies. I had a Lizardmen army made up, and a Chaos Marauder army.<br/><br/>Part of it was that my Empire army kept getting pwned by the Nurgle and Skaven armies I went up against. Part of it was that I was seeking more involvement in the hobby. Part of it was that point-toggling is fun, in and of itself. Part of it was that it's creative, within a rigorous structure.                        </div>
