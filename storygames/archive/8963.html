Meanwhile, Talos bumps into Justin, but the latter thinks he is dressed up as Dr. manhattan and drags him off to Leicester Square for the premiere of Watchmen!<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a little space-time warp tomfoolery, the four PCs plus the Doctor end up back in the 17th Century with Dick Turpin and a squad of Roman soldiers led by Gaius Julius Caesar! Since most of us had rather a lot of spotlight dice at this point, tyhe Doctor got very proactive, after an earlier bout of unconsciousness, and deduced that Talos was the cause of the problems, or at leats his warp manipulator anyway. With the full crew aiding him, the Doctor brought them all back to modern day Cardiff, where Justin confronted some latent secrets about his sexuality with the aid of Captain Jack... Oh, and a 50' high Marie Curie.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall the playetest was successful, with the plot being pulled in many entertaining &amp; different directions through the interaction of the players and their bidding to take over the role of the Doctor. The change from losing spotlight dice at random to spending them for directorial authority made for quite a build up of dice over the course of a session, which actually worled well in simulating the title character's tendency to resolve everything neatly in the last few minutes of the episode.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, lots of spotlight dice hanging around make it overwhelmingly likely for players to succeed at every action taken by the title character, so another tweak may be needed to allow players to target the dice held by each other. Alternatively, the total pool of spotlight dice available for any session may be limited to increase competition for them. Another play test coming up next week...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
