One of the things I've run into is a some doubt about the format. <br/><br/>For example, a couple people seemed turned off by the "ashcan" format, which I assume to mean they are jazzed about an made-in-the-garage ethic. They'd rather produce a perfect bound book, for example. But, then they think this format is no longer an ashcan.<br/><br/>Not so. <br/><br/>We do not require ashcans to be "hand built." The booth is far more about design approach of the game text and game itself than it is about the physical format. For example, Nathan's <i>Carry</i> would be a fine format for the ashcan booth.<br/><br/>SO! If you've kicked around any ideas for having a game at GenCon, keep the Ashcan Front in mind. I'm always happy to answer questions about the Ashcan Front!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63480/#Comment_63480" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-11T07:07:54+00:00" title="April 11, 2007  7:07AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2007 8:53AM by Andy.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>"Why should I pay $10 to playtest your unfinished game?"</b><br/><br/>Please make sure you have some solid answers to that question.  It caused a lot of tension a couple years ago when both Robots &amp; Rapiers and With Great Power came out in the Ashcan format (and I found myself jumping through about 10 threads on 3 different forums posting the same spiel each time to set the record straight, cause the authors weren't being 'deceptive', and the games were pretty awesome).<br/><br/>The answer in the above two cases was, after the usual "You'll be contributing to the design process yadda yadda", was "<i>You'll get $10 off the final finished product when it is released</i>".  However, that might not be the same for all ashcan designers (giving a discount).<br/><br/>Just something to think about. Hell, I'd actually write the above question and answer it on your FAQ on your site. Seriously think about, because you'll hear it asked on the net, and you'll certainly have it asked to your face 20 times a day at the booth.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>EDIT: Forgot to add: AWESOME.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63483/#Comment_63483" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-11T07:21:08+00:00" title="April 11, 2007  7:21AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, seems like what I'd ask, given that people tend to give ME things to get me to do playtesting, feedback, and assist with design and editing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63486/#Comment_63486" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-11T07:38:24+00:00" title="April 11, 2007  7:38AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, <br/><br/>If this goes well for Gen Con, would there be any thoughts about expanding to Origins next year?<br/>(Obviously, it is too late to get an Origins faction together this year.)<br/><br/>Blue                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63489/#Comment_63489" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-11T07:56:28+00:00" title="April 11, 2007  7:56AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The link doesn't seem to be responding.  :-(                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63495/#Comment_63495" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-11T08:27:14+00:00" title="April 11, 2007  8:27AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I support this and think it is exciting and cool.

It has been for a long time and I didn't exactly know why. What I ultimately realized is that I learn more as a designer not by playing other strong, solid games, but instead by finding unplaytested games with mechanics and subject matter that pique my interest, and playing them. I realized I learn best how to solve my own design issues by solving the kinds of design issues my brain is inclined to create. Playtesting like this is training myself to solve design issues without having to create them first <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>And it's incredibly rewarding creatively to engage with a designer and lend input and enthusiasm to a game that aids it to be born.<br/><br/>So what's the problem? The internet is full (increasingly so) of unplaytested roleplaying games. So why The Ashcan Front? Because the problem for playtesting and providing feedback on many games is not having a good sense of their design goals, their known design issues, and any way of knowing how serious the designer is about developing them for publication.<br/><br/>The Ashcan Front project aims to chip away at that problem. Ashcans are written to explicitly articulate a game's design goals and focus the reader's attention on mechanics, explanations, and examples that need feedback and playtesting, and all within the context of evidence from prior playtests. The text of an Ashcan is your primary evidence a designer is utterly serious and committed to developing the game for publication, and serious about engaging you for feedback. (Secondary evidence would be that the designer spent money, on artwork, on buying into a Gen Con booth, and put time and effort into hand making the game books clearly in excess of what it would have cost to do a perfect bound book via POD.)<br/><br/>I personally think it's important not to confuse the value proposition of the ashcan by offering a discount on the final game. Yes, I think designers could incentivize sales of ashcans by offering the discount. But a transaction dynamic of rewarding people for having faith in you is an ego game. What you want is a transaction dynamic that's about the real value proposition of the ashcan: the chance to help something awesome to be born.<br/><br/>(But no, discounts aren't prohibited.)<br/><br/>And with much of the voiced enthusiasm for The Ashcan Front coming from experienced designers (Clinton, Ron, Vincent, Judd, etc.) who're looking forward to buying ashcans at the booth, I'm certain I'm not alone in my lust for serious roleplaying problems to solve.<br/><br/>Actually, the big questions in my mind right now are:<br/><br/>1. Conviction that there are customers for the value proposition of ashcans is one thing, but given consumer culture how do you help folks actually realize they're interested? How would you pitch The Ashcan Front if you were working the booth Andy? JD?<br/>2. And how do you help designers know now that they should be working toward an ashcan for Gen Con?<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63546/#Comment_63546" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-11T13:39:53+00:00" title="April 11, 2007  1:39PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a very tempting offer Thor.

Paying for preview copies???"  IIRC (it's been like 3 years), even Chad U... or was it Phil Reed? (in any case, "another indie designer with no hate agenda or anything like that") was naysaying the idea, until I explained the aesthetic behind it:<br/>* the game is mostly done. It's totally playable as-is.<br/>* you know upfront that you're buying into a playtest version of a game that's 95% complete. No one is being deceived.<br/>* it's not the kind of thing some folks are into. Cez la vie.<br/>At this point, the replies from most folks is, "Oh, ok... uh, I can kiiiiiiiinda see how that would work..."<br/>And then I mentioned:<br/>* Oh, and if you bought the ashcan, you got a discount on the final product's release.<br/>"OHHHhhhh, ok, well THAT I can get behind. THAT makes sense".<br/><br/>I'm just saying, I'm a big supporter of the Ashcan thing, and will assuredly buy some myself. However, I saw the giant mess that the last attempt to sell ashcans created. You'll want to make sure that your answer to...<br/><b><br/>"Why should I pay $10 to playtest your unfinished game?"</b><br/><br/>...is as solid, tight, and SHORT as your response to the question "So what is your game about?".<br/><br/>Sure, the manifesto reply is good (and I totally believe it myself), but you'll need to find a solid answer that you can say in two sentences. You're going to be giving that answer a lot.  In fact, if you have a brochure or pamphlets at your table, I highly recommend that your "two sentence answer" is front-and-center on that sheet (if you want to sell stuff, that is), with the deeper explanation below.<br/><br/>I'm not even talking about appeasing the "haters". Whiny, bitter naysayers will always exist, no need to even address those people.  I'm thinking more like Average Joe, who knows nothing of 'the indie scene', who may be interested in your game but is taken aback by the whole "purchase a playtest" thing.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-Andy<br/><br/>EDIT, in the interests of full disclosure, IIRC (and I can't really remember, it's been 3 years) I've got the vague feeling that *I* was "Freddy Butterpants" in the "Review Comments" thread above.

But when I read the details, I get totally turned off.  Like the $10 price tag (when nearly all the indie comics refferred to are a half or a third of that price).  The argument given is this:\n<blockquote>Let's say designers start doing ashcans and next year at GenCon there's a bunch for sale at two to three dollars each. So I come home with seven of them. Every single one of those designers disadvantaged themselves with the two or three dollar price, because I can't possibly commit to providing meaningful feedback and/or playtesting to seven games, and each designer sold to me for less than what the ashcans are worth in time and materials. I bought them out of curiousity, at a price that didn't ask for my commitment of interest. </blockquote>\nBut that doesn't make any sense.  If all those same ashcans cost ten dollars, then you only go home with one of them.  Maybe you go home with two, but probably no more.  And lots of people go hom with none.<br/><br/>Now, you've bought the game based on imperfect information - you probably only spoke to one person at the booth, and they are likely to not have perfected their game pitch yet.  So it's quite possible that the game you bought isn't exactly the game you thought it was, or that another game at the booth is a game that would get you really excited, but you didn't buy it because that game's designer didn't get a chance to pitch it to you.  So you've spent $10 on a game you're okay with, but missed the game you really want.<br/><br/>In the $2-3 model, you bought seven games, read them all and find the one that gets you really jazzed.  You give it the feedback it needs and deserves.  I don't see how this is different than in the $10 model only giving feedback to one game, but not picking the game with as much information.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63646/#Comment_63646" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T09:35:11+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  9:35AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mr. Teapot</cite>You give it the feedback it needs and deserves.</blockquote>\nUnfortunately, you don't. (You in the "most people" sense).<br/><br/>I totally unwaveringly agree with Matt and Paul on this.  Well, I'd set some minimums to the juicy "$8" or "$9" mark.<br/><br/>1) If the ashcan designer hasn't perfected their game pitch (2 sentences), they shouldn't be there trying to sell them.<br/><br/>2) In the $2-3 model, you've bought seven games, are are not really gung-ho invested in any of them. Maybe you'll follow up on one of them with some feedback. But you haven't put some cash on the line to "make the game yours", so you'll have less of a commitment to giving feedback and the like. I've seen this happen with software development ALL THE TIME. It's exactly the same across those two fields: Get a bunch of software for free or cheap, and there's not a lot of investment in it.  Pay $20 and find issues with it? By god you'll be emailing the coder and giving him your perspective.<br/><br/>The best example is this: I've received a number of free games and game supplements over the years from various folks: Some were in relation to the Indie RPG Awards, some were from comments or reviews I posted somewhere, others were because I was just a nice guy. I didn't read through, review, or become particularly attached to any of these games.<br/><br/>In GenCon 2004, I spent $8 for With Great Power, and after reading and playing it basically wrote Mike the equivalent (via direct email or 3rd-party via RPGNet reviews and commentary) of about 5-8 pages of feedback. If Mike gave me a copy of WGP, or sold it to me for $2.00, I never would have become as invested as I was in it.  I would have been a little invested, because it was a great idea, but I wouldn't have had that "I paid money for this; in a way, I am this game's Venture Capitalist or Investor. So dammit, I'm going to give feedback!" feeling that I did after paying more than $5 for the ashcan.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63670/#Comment_63670" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T10:20:52+00:00" title="April 12, 2007 10:20AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul - My guillotine needs a new switch.

I have really dug on the idea of ashcan formats, and this seems like an excellent structure for getting these games out there and letting people give their input.  If I had a game I thought I could get playtested before Gen Con, I would be all over this... maybe next year, if this works out.  Regardless, I give my whole-hearted, if somewhat anonymous, approval.  If I can make it to Gen Con this year, and that's a real possibility for the first time in several years, I will pop over and see how I can get involved with the process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
