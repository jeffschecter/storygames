It's a bucolic wilderness town two hours from nowhere full of Slavic immigrants and assorted oddballs. <br/><br/>We've got a middle-aged dope grower from Latvia on collegial terms with the local state troopers, a drug mule for some Chechens up at the Pogo mine, a hapless, honest Fish and Game officer, and the relocated city slicker, second-generation American through and through with a wife who is going to be pure trouble. <br/><br/>PTA feels so lovely as things settle in and the texture and contours of the show start to resolve. This show is going to be about people who don't belong together, together. A little funny but with a hard, black edge. There was a great scene where Ivan Morozov, the Chechen's hired fool with impulse control issues, complained that they weren't teaching him the tools of the trade.<br/><br/>You want to learn the tools of the trade? Osman Timaev asked, and put a tape in the VCR. Watch and learn. It was a "best of" clip show of Russian soldiers in Chechnya being tortured and beheaded.<br/><br/>It set a certain tone at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430731/#Comment_430731" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-09T06:26:47+00:00" title="April  9, 2014  6:26AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Episode 2 of our PTA game, DELTA. +Jonathan Bolding's sad sack drug dealer Ivan Morotov was Screen Presence 3 tonight, one guy was out and the other two had Screen Presence 1, so my total budget was 13 and I still managed to kill him.<br/><br/>Morotov was in deep with the Chechens and nothing went right. He gave half his stash to "Boris Bogdanov", the relocated snitch who wants back in the game, and - after a heart to heart with his Vor v Zakone uncle - decided to pull the plug, go back to school, and start fresh. Being a genius he recruited his best friend, Tim Crane Jr, to take over for him, figuring the Chechens would be totally cool with this. Tim Crane Jr is the son of Tim Crane, who is the lead State Trooper in Delta Junction. So complicated!<br/><br/>Anyway Crane Junior and Ivan Morotov call a meet with the Chechens to announce their brilliant new change of low level management.  Sutarbi Sheripov, bag man for the bad guys, isn't amused and has Tim Crane junior beaten nearly to death with a hockey stick. Then both of them are taken out onto the Ft. Greely military base and executed by some nameless lake. It was very harsh.<br/><br/>As Producer it was fun to push hard and put death on the table. I made sure Jon was cool with it but it really made sense, and fits the tone perfectly. Ivan's death is going to be a huge problem for everybody. One of out "next week on..." pronouncements was +Clinton N. Dreisbach's hapless Fish and Game officer fishing the corpses out of the lake. And Jon is going to finish out the season as Tim Crane Senior.<br/><br/>The season has taken shape and we don't need any external elements. It's like an engine brought up to speed.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430732/#Comment_430732" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-09T06:27:14+00:00" title="April  9, 2014  6:27AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2014 6:36AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Episode three of DELTA.  The old Latvian dope grower's spotlight episode. But first of all, +Jonathan Bolding's protagonist died last episode, so he's playing a new guy - Tim Crane Senior, his old character's father. Issue: Rage. Edge: Brutal. So there's that.<br/><br/>We open with a call to Fish and Game. Nuisance bears on Redshirt lake and Peter Sokolov takes the call and finds the bodies. There's an oh shit moment when he realizes he's looking at the remains of the State Trooper's son who has clearly been executed. <br/><br/>Word spreads quickly and everybody is in shock or afraid or covering their tracks. Boris and his wife Tanya, in witness protection, hide the Chechen's drugs and, when questioned, instinctively provide Osman Timaev with an alibi. There's a great scene where their cover is almost blown to the Troopers. His local handler, the hapless Peter Sokolov, hangs him out to dry.<br/><br/>A distraught Tim Crane shakes down Ruslan, who gives up Boris Bogdanov as the killer. he knows which side his bread is buttered on and is not going to fuck with the Chechens.<br/><br/>After a routine questioning in which they become convinced that Boris was the shooter, two Troopers take him up to Wolf Creek for an informal second interrogation in which he loses a tooth.<br/><br/>Ivan Morotov's affable uncle Sasha comes calling and secures Ruslan's promise that when the killer is found he will help settle the matter "in the traditional way". The old criminal's message - don't cooperate with the American police.<br/><br/>And the hits keep on coming. A Mercedes pulls up to Ruslan's greenhouse driven by Abdul Malik Kadyrov, another Chechen bag man. There's an old woman in the passenger seat. It is Ruslan's wife, who he abandoned way back in 1970, back when he was a Soviet cop tamping down on pro-democracy Latvians. She's like "Hey Ruslan," and pours herself a cup of tea.<br/><br/>Abdul Malik tells him that his boss, Osman Timaev, will consider things square if Ruslan does him a favor. And he opens the trunk, where poor Sutarbi, shot in the jaw and in bad shape, is trussed up. Ruslan says he'll take care of it. He digs a grave in his cabbage patch and puts Sutarbi in it, then tells him to be patient and doesn't kill him. He goes back to his wife and his tea. Apparently he's going to fuck with the Chechens after all.<br/><br/>Turns out Sonia is here on behalf of their son Oleg, who's gotten mixed up with the Organizatsiya in America, and is in trouble, and will be out of trouble the moment a certain snitch is dead. The snitch is 100% for sure in Delta Junction. His name is Mikhail Petrov. Ruslan's never heard of him but it isn't hard to do the math on that one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430733/#Comment_430733" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-09T06:34:24+00:00" title="April  9, 2014  6:34AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Episode Four of DELTA. Shit is getting real in Delta Junction. Persistent in the background is Ruslan Padovka, getting high on his own supply with his wife, reunited after almost 30 years. She came to tell him the Organizatsiya wants an FBI snitch killed in exchange for their son's life. Sutarbi, the Chechen murderer Ruslan is supposed to have already executed, is sleeping fitfully in the greenhouse. <br/><br/>It's the spotlight episode of the two-bit Mafioso in the Witness Protection Program - Mikhail "Boris Bogdanov" Petrov (played with magnificent  idiotic desperation by +Joel Coldren) Things are not looking up for him.<br/><br/>Cole Richmond, his FBI handler, rolls into town all bleary-eyed from Anchorage and has a heart to heart. Bogdanov has no juice with the feds and the State Troopers like him for the double homicide. Bogdanov begs for protection - they are meeting in the dentists office where he's getting his teeth fixed after a State Trooper beating, for God's sake. Richmond shrugs. Make nice, he says. Hang tight. <br/><br/>So Bogdanov goes to the strongest man in town, the Chechen Osman Timaev, not knowing Timaev has already fingered him as the killer. He blusters his way into an audience with the drug lord and demands $30,000 in cash. His rationale?<br/><br/>1. He lied to the cops about Timaev's whereabouts the night of the killing<br/>2. He's a big man in the back-east Organizatisya.<br/><br/>One of these things is a lie and Timaev sorta knows it. The fact that this upstart Russian was mentioning his name to the cops at all is enough to get Bogdanov killed, and he says as much. Bogdanov pleads. He offers his Tesoro station. Finally he offers his wife Steffi "Tanya Bogdanov" Boyd as "collateral". Although repulsed by this craven display, Timaev agrees. He has a connection to Tanya that her husband is unaware of. They agree - Bogdanov is to return in one hour with his wife, and Timaev will give him 30K to skip town with.<br/><br/>Fish and Game officer Peter Sokolov is out doing knock-and-talks in Russian Village and meets the dead Ivan Morotov's uncle Sasha. Sasha, old skool Vor v Zakone, tells him that he intends to settle things old world style, and that Sokolov should back the fuck off. Sokolov gets the message loud and clear.<br/><br/>Bogdanov returns to the Tesoro station but Tanya isn't there. Pete Sokolov (our man +Clinton N. Dreisbach) is, though, and Sokolov bundles his erstwhile charge off to his house, where Agent Richmond is waiting. Sokolov convinces the FBI guy, his old buddy, that Bogdanov isn't the shooter. Richmond tells him to find the actual shooter, and that Bogdanov is to lie low at Sokolov's house in the mean time. <br/><br/>Meanwhile Tanya fishes out the bag of Chechen drugs from the Tesoro fuel tank and high-tails it out of town. <br/><br/>Back in Russian Village Trooper Tim Crane Senior (+Jonathan Bolding ) visits friendly old uncle Sasha out of uniform, just him and his camo F-450 and his AR-15. They have a talk. They have an understanding. Crane wants in. Uncle Sasha, never one to refuse a father his revenge, reluctantly agrees. <br/><br/>So Bogdanov returns to the Chechen's isolated trailer empty-handed. Peter Sokolov discreetly follows him and watches from afar through the scope of a rifle. Bogdanov goes inside. There's a conversation that doesn't seem to be going well. And then the door bursts open and Bogdanov is being frog-marched out back by Milana "Khoka" Korgay, one of Timaev's people. She has a sheep-killing knife in her hand and she's going to cut Bogdanov's throat in the back yard. <br/><br/>Peter Sokolov, the mild-mannered Fish and Game officer whose wife warned him a few hours earlier not to get involved in "all this dirty business", sights in and takes the shot.<br/><br/>Everything is set up for a king-hell trainwreck season finale for the ages!

Season Finale. Hapless Fish and Game officer Peter Sokolov is in the spotlight. Blood and thunder follow.<br/><br/>To recap: Sokolov shot the Chechen woman who was about to gut Boris Bogdanov like a trout, then dropped his rifle and drove off. Bogdanov ran into the alders, lost and terrified. Ruslan Padovka had a pleasant evening getting re-acquainted with his wife Sonia while the damaged Chechen he was supposed to murder slept fitfully in his greenhouse. And State Trooper Tim Crane, Senior was in his garage, loading AR-15 magazines.<br/><br/>Sokolov calls Trooper Crane in a panic and then shows up at his house. He tells Crane he killed a woman. Crane gives him a lot of room to explain himself but Sokolov doesn't, and ends up in cuffs in the State Trooper modular. Crane is off his rocker and the other Troopers are getting nervous. The most sensible of them, Tyler, lets Sokolov make a few calls, and he calls in the cavalry. <br/><br/>Out at the greenhouse Ruslan Padovka makes a bomb. He has a nice chat with Sutarbi (who scrawls his portion on a notepad, his jaw being ruined). They agree that Sutarbi will go collect Timaev and bring him to the greenhouse to be "put down like an animal", and suddenly Boris Bogdanov, hypothermic and freaking out, shows up. He'd wandered around in sub-zero weather for hours.<br/><br/>Tim Crane Senior meets up with Sasha and the Russian posse, there is some back and forth and finally they depart to kill the Chechens. When they arrive at Timaev's trailer it appears abandoned. They kick in the doors and a huge fuel-air bomb goes off, killing them all in a fireball visible for miles. <br/><br/>Sutarbi leaves and Bogdanov calls his handler, Fish and Game officer Sokolov, currently handcuffed to a desk. He begs Sokolov to come save him. Sokolov agrees, pulls out the desk drawer and leaves, wearing it like jewelry. He steals Tyler's patrol car and is on his way to the greenhouse when he sees the fireball. he changes course.<br/><br/>Arriving on scene it is a charnel house of burned bodies, possibly concealing his own crime. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, back at the greenhouse, the Chechens have arrived. Ruslan hustles his wife and the cowering Boris Bogdanov into his cellar. Timaev's enforcer, Abdul-malik, walks in carrying an AK-47 in one hand and Sutarbi's head in a Safeway bag in the other. <br/><br/>Ruslan screams "God bless America!" as the bomb detonates. He miscalculated - it levels his house and greenhouse, killing both him and Abdul-Malik instantly. <br/><br/>Sokolov shows up in his stolen car and immediately runs into the fire to look for survivors. he finds Bogdanov and leads him up, out and to safety, then goes back for Sonia. While he is rescuing Sonia, Bogdanov realizes that Timaev is there, sighting in with the Fish and Game officer's hunting rifle. There's a moment of clarity, Bogdanov pleads and Timaev shoots him down.<br/><br/>Sokolov emerges with Sonia. There's another moment, and he decides not to be a hero. Timaev watches him collect the barely-alive Bogdanov and flee the scene.<br/><br/>So the season ends with a blood-covered Peter Sokolov confronting his FBI liaison, in his own living room. He persuades the FBI guy that he's not to blame and insists he stay for dinner. They have thirty pounds of caribou steak that won't eat itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430776/#Comment_430776" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-09T22:26:09+00:00" title="April  9, 2014 10:26PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So...

I mostly poked at this through his wife, Katie-Ruth, with whom he had a connection. <br/>Ivan Morotov's issue was Self Control / Tim Crane Senior's issue was Rage. I didn't need to encourage either of these.<br/>Ruslan Padovkin's issue was Safety and then changed to "Non-attachment". I made him unsafe by pointing the Chechens at him and then introducing his wife Sonia after heavy telegraphing from the player.<br/>Boris Bogdanov's issue was Survival, also not too hard to push on, through Steffi and the Chechens and Tim Crane Junior while he lasted.<br/><br/>I think my hand is pretty light (for PTA) but I followed the rules and framed every scene, etc.<br/><br/>We didn't use the chase scene three-part resolution at all!

That didn't work so well for us; even with a 3-stage card-flip, it didn't <i>feel</i> like a satisfying or interesting action scene.<br/><br/>(Maybe it's just because you can't make any meaningful choices once the cards are down? There are no further decisions to be made, no back-and-forth interactions, just more narration...and narration feels like where action goes to die.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430914/#Comment_430914" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-13T17:29:34+00:00" title="April 13, 2014  5:29PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's good to know what you like.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430918/#Comment_430918" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-13T21:14:49+00:00" title="April 13, 2014  9:14PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2014 9:15PM by JDCorley.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the game is not so good for "action" insofar as the system doesn't tell you much about your actions at all - you (and whoever gains the right to resolve the conflict) can say things about your actions but the system doesn't do anything except say who gets to say those things when.  But it doesn't mean you can't create a good action show - it just means the system won't be the thing introducing or resolving tension into the action.  Similarly, the system doesn't really introduce or resolve tension into other character <i>decisions</i> (romance, etc.)  Instead, within the confines of the Issue and the attendant character arc mechanic, you and your fellow players do. What the system does is to resolve <i>consequences</i> of decisions - do you get what you want by building your A-Team battlewagon and running it through the barn door, or did the polyester-wearing arms dealer escape in the confusion?<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm always interested to hear about the pitched game versus the finished product.
