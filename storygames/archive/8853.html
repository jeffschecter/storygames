We had discussed several game systems (we almost played My Life With Master, with the Master being a Gygax-style Dungeon Master) but in the end we decided we were more familiar with Vincent Baker's In a Wicked Age.<br/><br/>So, the first step was Oracles.  We game up with three sets of oracles:<br/><br/>Character Oracles, which described various iconic D&amp;D characters<br/>Dungeon Oracles, which described rooms in the Dungeon<br/>Monster Oracles, which described, well, Monsters<br/><br/>Everyone (and we had 8 players) had to come up with one of each Oracle, which we wrote down on slips of paper.  Several people made more than one of each.  Then we drew Character Oracles, letting people grab whichever character they liked.  In the end, we had:<br/><br/>Hapgood: a human thief, on the run from an angry mob.<br/>Igro, a dwarven assassin who was out to kill a member of the party<br/>A halfling thief*, who had stolen a magic ring off the hand of an ogre magi (actually, he stole the hand, too!)<br/>Gregor, a human knight with a magic talking shield (actually, a shield that talked back a lot... very insulting)<br/>Horus, a gnome illusionist with a faery dragon familiar<br/>Ariana, a drow druidess who used poisons<br/>Sir Helios, a human paladin who is seeking a magic sword<br/><br/>* Can't remember the character's name, dang<br/><br/>I then drew two monster oracles, for the boss monster and his lieutenant.  We got<br/><br/>An old red dragon, sitting on a bed of gold<br/>A flying, fire-breathing owlbear (obviously half-dragon <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>So, the story came out that the party was at the town of Villageton on the Wet River and near the Swampy Swamp.  They were charged by a Mysterious Stranger (actually the ogre magi) in the Random Tavern to go kill the red dragon of Fire Dragon Mountain.  (The locals weren't very good with naming things.)  They met up with a thief, who was on the run from an Angry Mob) and the Mysterious Stranger insisted they take his dwarven "muleskinner" along (while tasking the dwarven assassin to find his ring and kill the one who took it.)<br/><br/>After the paladin convinced the Angry Mob to disperse, the party set out for Fire Dragon Mountain.  Along the way, I drew a Monster Oracle for a "Wandering Monster Encounter."  They met up with a "giant lynx with human intelligence," which I played as a kind of Cheshire Cat.  It insisted that the party answer a riddle before it let them pass, but after learning that they had read both Tolkein and mythology, it had to make do with "What is black and white and red all over?"  Then the party attacked, with the drow druidess trying to protect the "endangered species."  In the end, the party drove the lynx off.<br/><br/>They now approached Fire Dragon Mountain and entered the caves.  I drew a Dungeon Oracle, and I got a sliding chute trap.  We had a one-round conflict, with everyone answering the trap's conflict (done as the third round of a normal conflict is done, you win if you just beat the other side.)  Most of the party went sliding down into the next room<br/><br/>That room, according to two new oracles, had a monster a midden heap and a cursed magic sword.  The paladin and the drow fought to get the sword, with the paladin winning.  I then informed him that it was a "+3 sword of berserking" which used "With Violence," was potent, and had one special stipulation:  if he used it, EVERYONE had to answer the conflict, not just his target.<br/><br/>That was when the monster in the midden heap attacked.  The paladin won initiative, and began attacking EVERYONE.In the end, we negotiated that the party fled in different directions, with the half the party going one way, half another, and the paladin left alone.<br/><br/>The first half of the party found themselves in a swampy cave with an elvish princess tied to a stake.  It turned out to be the home of a Black Dragon (who was voiced by Samuel L. Jackson--long story).  It seemed that the dragon was on the Atkins diet, so he could only eat virgins... and the human thief managed to take the princess "off the menu" so to speak.  The dragon left in a huff.<br/><br/>The other part of the party found themselves in a room that teleported them to an identical room, but where the only exit led to a tunnel filled with green slime.  The dwarf ended up getting all his body hair burned off by the slime.<br/><br/>The paladin encountered a room where gravity was reversed, and where he met a surviving member of Sir Robin's minstrels.  They were attacked by a huge, intelligent carrion crawler, which swallowed him whole.  As a result of negotiation, it did not digest him, but rather left him transformed into an illithid (mind flayer.)<br/><br/>(To be continued)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhosmer1" title="jhosmer1"><img alt="jhosmer1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4446384493_29cc47b601_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhosmer1">jhosmer1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195805/#Comment_195805" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T05:53:46+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  5:53AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Continued from above)<br/><br/>The whole party managed to meet up again in a large cavern, where they fought the owlbear (and some of them fought the paladin, not recognizing him as a friend).  The knight managed to kill it and take it's head, which he intended to use as a trophy.  The dwarf, having seen his master's ring (and crawling hand!) in the halfling's possession, attacked him.  He ended up destroying the ring, which freed him from the ogre magi's control.<br/><br/>It was then that the cavern floor collapsed, sending them sprawling onto the dragon's hoard.  They all attacked the dragon, with mostly poor resulting in bad ends (for the record, the dragon had Fire Breath as a particular strength, which was Doubly Potent, Broad, and Consequential):<br/><br/>The paladin tried to eat the dragon's brain, but got swallowed instead.<br/><br/>The dragon's wings blew the drow's potions back in her face, with very bad results<br/><br/>The halfling tried to stick an armoire into the dragon's mouth to keep it from swallowing people, but the armoire fell on him.<br/><br/>The gnome illusionist released the dragon's collection of pinned faery dragons, which confused it<br/><br/>The knight and the dwarf managed to get a good hits in<br/><br/>Hapgood, the human thief finally managed to kill the dragon, stabbing it in a spot where the dwarf had hacked off a scale, but the dragon's death throes took out the dwarf and the knight.<br/><br/>In the end, only Hapgood and Horus were still standing, but they were triumphant!<br/><br/>I think Gary would have approved (except for the fact that two PCs were still alive at the end. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>All in all, I think we managed to capture a lot of the feel and fun of Old School D&amp;D, as some of us played back in our school days and in our parents' basements.  It was a lot of fun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195839/#Comment_195839" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T08:09:13+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  8:09AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/khelek" title="khelek"><img alt="khelek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/khelek">khelek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195841/#Comment_195841" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T08:19:28+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  8:19AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was an interesting abuse of a system.
