What sort of numbers are appropriate for Fear &amp; Reason? How do you keep the tension going and the relationships bubbling over that timescale? What sort of balance of scenes works best? And any other wisdom gained from practical experience would be greatly appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337504/#Comment_337504" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-07T08:09:02+00:00" title="August  7, 2011  8:09AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Following with interest, since I've played the hell out of it but only as a one-shot.

If you don't fidget with the rules (giving starting love points, for example) it's almost impossible to play in one slot, and even if you do, you have to run it quickly, over situations and scenes that would work better with more time to play them<br><br>So, I suggest: simply follow the rules. Stop using the quick-play shortcut used in convention one-shot and play the game as it's written Take your time playing the character interaction. Use the time to increase the depths of the master's villainy that you can show. Make your NPC real (I can't believe some people think this is something you have to do only in AW...) and play them as individuals.<br/><br/>The normal duration of the-game-as-written is about 2-4 sessions (6-8 hours of play), depending on your group's habits. If you choose a hight fear value and a low reason value the duration can be even much longer, but I don't suggest searching to play "long" as an objective: play the game playing the characters, and follow them to the natural conclusion, without hurrying or delaying the Master's death                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337521/#Comment_337521" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-07T11:48:46+00:00" title="August  7, 2011 11:48AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2011 11:49AM by Moreno R..">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.S.: about playing My Life With Master, a friend of mine started a series of blog posts with suggestions and informations about how to play the game.

I think you consider it a list of rules variants. Semantics. The point is, as you said yourself, that it's better to play with more time (and if you play 4 hours straight with the level of intensity of a good MLWM game, you are already in a strange territory for me, I prefer shorter sessions)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MummyKitty</cite>Is this game still in print, or is there a way to obtain a copy?</blockquote>\nPeter already posted the link to the site. I add that it's one of the great "classics" of Indie games, winner of 4 indie rpgs awards (a record) and winner of the Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming.
