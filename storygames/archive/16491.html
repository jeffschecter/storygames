A few years back, I ran a steampunkish story game via the PS3 Eye. Then, I did a bunch Skype gaming. Nowadays, I'm experimenting with G+ Hangouts.<br/><br/>In all cases, I've found a few things that work for me, and a few things that don't. Some of this seems like common sense, but let me tell you, none of this really occurred to me until I was confronted with it while gaming, and now I have to be up-front about it whenever I'm doing any online gaming with anybody.<br/><br/>1. I really need to see who I'm gaming with. I can't look at a static image. Facial expressions are a must, if I'm going to be gaming with someone.<br/><br/>2. Can't have any interference. No TV in the background, no voices except for the people playing the game.<br/><br/>3. Players have to commit to timely decision-making. Long silent gaps, while players mentally sort through their options, can really rob a game of momentum, whether I'm the player awaiting his turn, or the GM trying to get the session moving along. Even if the player needs time to think, it's good if at least some of that thought-process is verbalized -- and it's even better if that player just says, <i>I need a minute, someone else go ahead.</i><br/><br/>4. Bad connection is worse than no connection. If there's no connection, you can do something else, like read a book or trim your cat's toenails. But if there's a bad connection, and there's one person who sounds like they're being autotuned by Max Headroom, and no one can understand them, and that person won't just say, <i>Hey, I got a bad connection, I'm bowing out</i> -- then it kills the buzz for the whole group. It makes the game difficult.<br/><br/>How about you? What are some things you've learned about playing online? <br/><br/>Any preparation you do beforehand? If so, what kind?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377568/#Comment_377568" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T13:09:58+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  1:09PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All these things are true.<br/><br/>I do my normal types of preparation beforehand for the role I'm playing in the game.<br/><br/>Infrno.net is pretty fun, I've enjoyed it.

It has a lot of different dynamics than voice chat, audio chat, or even IM gaming.<br/><br/>In my experiences with it, there was definitely a greater disconnect between player and character. It's a lot harder to get "into it" when you're writing prose descriptions rather than speaking as your character in real time. I'd recommend it to gamers who are more into the storytelling aspect of gaming than the immersive aspect.<br/><br/>Some other things I've noticed:<br/><br/>1) In most freeform games, if you stop posting the story will basically leave your character behind. That means there's a lot of potential for Chuck Cunningham syndrome and dangling plot threads. If one player can't post for a while, it's good form to let the other players know so that they can explain your character's absence/inactivity (a lot like when a actor in a weekly serial drama takes an extended break).<br/><br/>2) The time-frames are weird. There aren't any scheduled, set time-frames for when the players sit down and game. That means the "game" is constantly running in the background of the player's personal lives. Great for people with unpredictable schedules, and very, very bad for people with addictive personalities (speaking from experience here).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noisms" title="noisms"><img alt="noisms" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/download/file.php?avatar=7881_1233713790.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noisms">noisms</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378041/#Comment_378041" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-13T01:40:51+00:00" title="May 13, 2012  1:40AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did quite a bit of PBP and PBEM when I didn't have a regular gaming group because I was living abroad. <br/><br/>On balance, for "orthodox" gaming I think it is vastly inferior to playing face-to-face and requires <i>extreme</i> dedication on the part of the GM and players to get it to work - because all the things that you take for granted in a face-to-face game which really grease the wheels (banter, snacks, being able to draw maps and pictures instantly on scraps of paper, watching the dice roll and going "ooh!" when the results are interesting, and all the rest) are absent.<br/><br/>But as orklord said, there is one element in which PBP or PBEM is superior, and that's if you're into developing character and story. The PBP games I've seen which have had the greatest success (I'm talking 3, 4 years of play and counting) have generally been more like shared fiction writing than gaming, with each player writing posts several hundred words long and really getting into the story-telling aspects. That's not for me at all, but if it's what you want, PBP is the perfect tool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378049/#Comment_378049" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-13T04:30:44+00:00" title="May 13, 2012  4:30AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>I've never done video conference gaming, but in my audio Skype gaming I've found that the most important thing is that people can't be understood when more than one person talks at a time.

So the more structured the initiative or turn-to-talk or whatever, the easier it is. I suppose the GM's participation level and style can also have an impact.

I'm with JDCorley, I much prefer audio-only to video.  We started out with video because one player really wanted it, but all I ever saw was pasty faces lit by monitor light, staring slack-jawed and slightly off camera.  I find it hard to build rapport with someone who doesn't seem to be looking directly at me (since the camera and monitor aren't quite in the same spot).<br/><br/>That, plus the fact that there are already tons of things to look at - my campaign notes and the character sheets, in particular (our game is long-term and crunchy).  Overload was a huge problem when we started out.  Between the shared whiteboard, the google docs charsheets, Skype, and the video app, we had an audio stream, two visual channels and five chat channels.<br/><br/>In the end we ditched the video, agreed not to use any chat but Skype (and there, only for hyperlinks, the spelling of NPC names, and "brb" type comments), and tossed the whiteboard.  A gaming table is vital for grid-based games, but I found that I'd rather stick to verbal-only descriptions rather than have a channel we only drag out for special occasions.<br/><br/>I keep the topology simple and permissive.  Interesting 3D spaces (balconies, walkways, overhanging terraces) make for great concept art, but are really problematic verbally, and stuff like, "Uh, well, you can't shoot at the guy on the balcony from where you are, you're too low," derails the game as you try to reconcile imaginations.<br/><br/>If we were playing a game like Fiasco instead of Burning Wheel, I could see wanting video.<br/><br/>One thing I notice is that our games have a strange, laser-sharp focus to them.  In a physical room, you can be talking Peter while having half an ear out for what John and Kim are discussing nearby, but with a single audio channel, only one person can talk at a time.  Chit chat has completely disappeared from our game; we plug in, play solidly for 3 hours, then disconnect.<br/><br/>I think that's also a side effect of there being no 'getting set up' talk while Kim unpacks her books, as you get in real life.  We start at 8:30 on the button, after which we're stuck at our computers, so everyone's already gone to the bathroom, fetched a drink or a snack, got their rulebooks handy.<br/><br/>Sound quality is really vital.  I strongly urge everyone to get a good headset.  Every now and again someone tries to participate with a built-in microphone, and the echo of the room or buzz from the fan vibrating their laptop case just kills my concentration, even when they're not talking.<br/><br/>Our group has gotten smaller over the years, and I suspect that's no coincidence.  There's three of us, a GM and two players.  We handle the turn-taking fairly smoothly; we talk over one another from time to time, and "go ahead" is now reflexive after collisions, but it's more of a problem the more players you have.<br/><br/>I've also found we've developed verbal substitutes for watching body language.  From time to time we'd have these situations where we'd be waiting for someone to look something up in the rulebook, only to find he thought I was doing that.  Now I don't wait longer than a few seconds before investigating a mysterious pause.<br/><br/>"Out of spotlight" time is deadly when you're sitting in front of a net-connected computer, particularly since the GM can't see when someone zones out, and, as the GM, it can be easy to forget (since you're nearly always participating in the spotlight).<br/><br/>My prep is about the same as for a face-to-face game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378521/#Comment_378521" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T14:58:55+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  2:58PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafael</cite>How about you?
