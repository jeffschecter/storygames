The vestigial chariot race aspect of the game intrigues me. The 45-60 min. play time is something I'm looking for in my role-playing these days, and the different phases (the play, the show, the crib, even the shuffle and restart) offer structured play, which I enjoy in games.<br/><br/>How would you make cribbage into a role-playing game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244009/#Comment_244009" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-27T19:47:50+00:00" title="November 27, 2009  7:47PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 27, 2009 7:49PM by jason.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know much about cribbage, but your mention of "the vestigial chariot race aspect of the game" made me think of a Ben-Hur kind of game.<br/><br/>Maybe take a cue from a big sports match today, and have some kind of "pre-game" show establishing the rivalries of the two charioteers? Then, the game plays out their climactic race.<br/><br/>For campaign play, you could use teams--like the Blues and Greens in Byzantium. If you play after Justinian, teams could have political and even theological matters on the line.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244021/#Comment_244021" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-28T00:25:01+00:00" title="November 28, 2009 12:25AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been playing more this evening, and I'm not sure it would work. Cribbage works just fine as is; I don't know how to insert roleplaying aspects without interrupting the nice flow and strategy the game has. Still, it's an interesting thought, and I might noodle with it.<br/><br/>I like your idea, Jason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
