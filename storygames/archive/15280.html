The first idea that occurs to me is to have a simple map of a long corridor. You'd take several d6s and throw them lengthwise along the map. (If some stray off the map, slide 'em over so they're on it.) The results of the dice would determine what's on the map -- e.g., 1s are Secondary Objectives, 2s are Obstacles, 3s are Weapons, and 4s, 5s, and 6s are Enemies. The goal would be to fight your way to the end of the map, tackling Secondary Objectives along the way (somehow or other), without getting your damn self shot to death. <br/><br/>Not quite sure how the specifics would work, or if it'd even be <i>fun</i> (as opposed to a bunch of senseless dice-rolling), so I may not take it any farther. I dunno. But I like the idea of dice-as-things, and the details of the map being different every time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347128/#Comment_347128" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-27T23:32:59+00:00" title="October 27, 2011 11:32PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is a cool idea, Mike.

You're free to make a level one that doesn't suck!<br/><br/>I would love to see someone do Tetris or a similar action-puzzler and have the "Stage Two" rules just be "it speeds up."<br/><br/>I'm working on the first stage of a Zelda-inspired game, which I think is going to be the classic "Lost Woods" portion.  I heard Sage was thinking about a more dungeon-y Zelda thing.

X-Com and 3:16 are two very different genres. 3:16 is about nonchalantly blasting your way through hordes of aliens, and whilst the later stages of X-Com might feel like that, the first stages are anything but. They're about creeping around in the dark, the only sounds an unnerving drone and the screams of your squadmates as they're taken down by alien snipers. And if you do manage to find an alien, it tries to rips you in half and lay eggs in your corpse. You're insufficiently armed, insufficiently armoured, and readily expendable. You'll be lucky to make it back to the Skyranger alive, soldier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347157/#Comment_347157" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-28T09:21:48+00:00" title="October 28, 2011  9:21AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2011 9:22AM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I've done <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iQUKqCUc2yWyiycA7FZ2B5loSJVl1pfU3LxVadsxfh0/edit?hl=en_US#" rel="nofollow">Gauntlet</a>.

I've called that project Silent Sound.  I saw this and thought it was a good opportunity to kill or remix some of the sacred cows from my current design.  So while it does reflect a RADICAL ground up approach, it isn't something I just started thinking about.<br/><br/>Also, there is no way it fits on two pages.  I'm already on page 5 and am only half way through.<br/><br/>Also, I get the impression that "Stage Two" was supposed to encourage at the table game design.  That's not the approach I'm taking.  The game provides all the prep work you would need to play the first location but there is A LOT of prep work necessary to play each location and so the game includes instructions for how to do that prep work beyond the first location.  There is no need to design new rules, but you do have to creatively prep the content for each "stage".<br/><br/>Finally, I'm sure it will done by Sunday.  So, if nothing else it's been a fresh take on an old project.<br/><br/>I'm just cheating cheater who cheats.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347454/#Comment_347454" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-31T18:56:12+00:00" title="October 31, 2011  6:56PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ Jesse: Love it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347456/#Comment_347456" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-31T18:57:59+00:00" title="October 31, 2011  6:57PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm working out the kinks in an Alpha Centauri game, drawing on It's Complicated and, to a lesser extent, Freemarket.

I think because it actually does the whole "oddball shapes falling downward" thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347761/#Comment_347761" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-03T12:14:33+00:00" title="November  3, 2011 12:14PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://nickwedig.libraryofhighmoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/scrabblenauts.pdf" rel="nofollow">Scrabblenauts</a> is a game that appeared, fully formed, in my mind the first time I played <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribblenauts" rel="nofollow">Scribblenauts</a> two years ago.

This is the only one of the other entries I've had a chance to look at, albeit briefly, other than what I've been working on, and I am also of the opinion that it captures the feel of the old Dragon Warrior game, allowing for a solo adventurer, and yet having roles for four people, which is pretty cool.<br/>I'll probably be reading quite a few mini games over the next couple of days. Most seem pretty interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348057/#Comment_348057" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-06T00:35:36+00:00" title="November  6, 2011 12:35AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2011 12:36AM by Hans_c-o.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wasn't planning on coming, but now I totally will!<br/><br/>EDIT: unwhispered because I think Orion et. al. would want to know that we're playing Dragon &amp; Warrior next Sunday.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348059/#Comment_348059" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-06T00:39:43+00:00" title="November  6, 2011 12:39AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans c-o</cite>Wasn't planning on coming, but now I totally will!</blockquote>\nAWESOME!<br/>And I'll bring copies of the various projects I've been working on, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348064/#Comment_348064" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-06T01:15:32+00:00" title="November  6, 2011  1:15AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry folks, I'm probably talking about <i>Dragon and Warrior</i> way too much, but I realized the reason that it gets me so excited, my heart pumping so fast:<br/><br/>It hits, in theory (again, haven't played it yet), <i>so</i> close to what I thought TTRPGs were back before I played them and was still enamored with JRPGs.

I'll still accept any others that trickle in during the next little bit.  I know Shreyas was working on a Minecraft game, but I don't know if he's seen the end of the tunnel or not.  I made some good progress on stage one of Super Farmhand, my Zelda-inspired game, but I'll have to post that later.  Maybe it'll be done by the time I'm done reviewing.<br/><br/>All these games look terrific and exciting folks.  Some of them I want to play right now.  I'll try to send out comments and invitations as soon as I can.  I'll aim for at least one review a day, to try to put myself on track to finish in a reasonable time.  In the meantime, let us know if any of these get played and how they went!  Don't wait for me!<br/><br/>There may be too many good games here for a single booklet-sized anthology, but that's a good problem to have.  Let's cross that bridge when we get to it, if enough people accept invitations and are excited about publishing these collectively.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348193/#Comment_348193" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-07T08:01:07+00:00" title="November  7, 2011  8:01AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait!

The first inkling of "story" in the game doesn't happen until the end of Facility anyway, but to make that interaction meaningful I'd probably have to move away from the solitaire aspect of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348399/#Comment_348399" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-08T21:10:19+00:00" title="November  8, 2011  9:10PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Orion: Dude, as far as I'm concerned, I haven't been this jazzed about a rules-lite console RPG emulator in a long, long time.

It would be cool to see some of the other challenges put in place, like needing a certain amount of accuracy or or taking a limited amount of hits, though there's already a lot to keep track of in the game and accuracy might be kind of a pain to track. Some thoughts about the game: when I got to the last section, the dam, I only rolled 1 level one bad guy and all the rest were crates and ammo. That ended up feeling pretty anticlimactic. What if you set the amount of bad guys in each part of the map and the player rolled dice until he got that many? It could also help keep the balance in the difficulty of a map against the time limit. <br/><br/>Also, again there's a lot to keep track of and some way of simplifying the book-keeping would be nice. At the same time, those bookkeeping bits feel straight from the game, it's just that the game keeps track of them automatically for you. I'm tempted to run the game for someone else and control all the enemies and do all the book-keeping for them, just to streamline their experience and make it feel a little more like the video game. What if you made a countdown track or grid of numbers that the player could slide a counter around on to keep track of ticks and ammo?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orion%20Canning" title="Orion Canning"><img alt="Orion Canning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/119/n90YJAPJ48BYJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orion%20Canning">Orion Canning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348615/#Comment_348615" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-10T17:13:49+00:00" title="November 10, 2011  5:13PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">@stupidgremlin</a>: Thanks man, I hope you play it and let me know how it goes. I don't know where you can get silver and white (i'll ask jackson) but it has four different explain cards that give narrative control over different aspects of the story to different players, which then get passed around, so that's the main thing I took from that game. The big difference in my game is that one of the cards is also control over the only protaganist of the game. I got to playtest the game on tuesday with jackson, robert, and my brother sean, and it was a lot of fun. We encountered some problems though. First off we were having too much fun roleplaying and setting scenes in the town and we didn't leave to kill monsters for the first two hours, which left the first monster player hanging and making monsters for too long. So in the new rules I'm creating a scene economy that limits the scenes you can do in town, forcing you to go to new areas and complete quests to get more scenes. That should also mirror the way you need to complete quests in videogames to progress the plot. I've also attempted to create more opportunities for the explain cards to switch around, and I'm writing in more guidelines for keeping the game balanced. Anyways, I'm glad you like it. I'm excited to play all the other stage 1 games too!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager

That ended up feeling pretty anticlimactic. </blockquote>\nYeah, I feared that. Measures to avoid that were sacrificed in favor of fitting it all in two pages.\n<blockquote>What if you set the amount of bad guys in each part of the map and the player rolled dice until he got that many? It could also help keep the balance in the difficulty of a map against the time limit.</blockquote>\nI could see doing that, or saying, "If you have fewer than X Guards on this map, roll d6s equal to the difference. Dice that result in 4-6 are level 1-3 Guards." Something like that.\n<blockquote>Also, again there's a lot to keep track of and some way of simplifying the book-keeping would be nice. At the same time, those bookkeeping bits feel straight from the game, it's just that the game keeps track of them automatically for you. </blockquote>\nYeah, exactly. The ammo's vital to track. At first the Guards were taking hits, but I quickly realized that -- of course -- that would be a pain to track, so it became a binary thing. Your own hits are absolutely necessary. The game isn't about time constraints for most levels, so tracking ticks might seem odd, but ultimately it was just a way to get the Guards to automatically oppose you without requiring a GM. It has the side benefit of making Secret Agent and 00 Agent more difficult, so bonus. <br/><br/>Tracking hits on the Crates... that also seems like a necessary evil. Or you could roll a d6 for every hit blocked, I guess, and it blows up on a 5+. But then you're rolling more dice, which could get confusing and time-consuming.\n<blockquote>I'm tempted to run the game for someone else and control all the enemies and do all the book-keeping for them, just to streamline their experience and make it feel a little more like the video game. </blockquote>\nThat would totally work, of course. For me, making it a solo game was important because, outside of the excellent multiplayer, Goldeneye is such a solitary endeavor. I wanted to preserve that.\n<blockquote>What if you made a countdown track or grid of numbers that the player could slide a counter around on to keep track of ticks and ammo?</blockquote>\nOh, absolutely -- it would benefit from all kinds of play aids. I just didn't have room to include them, or even advice about that. If it hadn't been for the Stage Two setup, I probably would've used that last column for a hit, ammo, and tick tracker.<br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348675/#Comment_348675" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-11T09:54:11+00:00" title="November 11, 2011  9:54AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 11, 2011 10:33AM by stupidgremlin.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are the links to high-res (at least, as high-res as old NES graphics can be) PDFs of the Monster and Reference cards I made for Orion's Dragon &amp; Warrior.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?q3fw836p43fim2u" rel="nofollow">Monster Cards</a>: 4up per 8.5x11 page, blank fields so you can fill in your own details<br/><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?kcd8pcce749xijd" rel="nofollow">Reference Cards</a>: 2up per 8.5x11 page, the Dragon Warrior card also functions as the character sheet.<br/><br/>I'd recommend writing on them with Sharpies, or other dark, permanent pens.

Plus, the smaller sizes make it easier to print on ISO standard papers (I believe A4 size), as well as laminate afterwards.<br/><br/>EDIT: I should also mention, for sake of completeness, that credit for the ripped NES graphics go to <a href="http://www.spriters-resource.com/" rel="nofollow">The Spriters Resource</a>, and specifically the contributors Valoc Darkmyre, Bean, Luke Groundwalker, Tonberry2k, and Vanarus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348683/#Comment_348683" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-11T10:26:17+00:00" title="November 11, 2011 10:26AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You guys are awesome.

I also really like the way the baddies are streamlined to shoot on your turn, which helps streamline things.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">@stupidgremlin</a>: Cool! Thanks for uploading these, I really appreciate it. Also, good call on combining the character sheet with the dragon warrior explain card, that's one of the first revisions I made after the playtest.<br/><br/>However, as much as i love your monster cards, I think drawing the monster pictures is a big part of the fun. One of the highlight of our playtest was a monster Jackson made, a belligerent, irate tree stump completely unable to move and easy to kill, who would taunt dragon warrior until he killed it. Think of the black knight as a tree stump. And the drawing only made it better. In fact, one thing I was thinking would be fun to do is scan the monster cards from our game and put them up somewhere where other people could post theirs. Anyways, I recommend drawing monsters, it's fun. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/jwalton">@jwalton</a>: I played All Cosmos with Robert Bruce, and it's a fun dice game. He mentioned it on your blog, but we didn't have enough dice to keep our whole collection for the entire game. I think you need 60 dice to win if you go all the way to beating the d20. per person maybe, if it's close. That's a lot of dice! So the natural solution we came accross was dumping our collection back into the middle whenever we went up a dice got upgraded. This provided a neat balance and rhythm to the game; as we played the easy dice would usually get sucked up into our collections, making it harder to get dice the fuller they got. Then one player or the other would go over the thresh-hold and spill all the easy dice back in the middle, giving the other player the first opportunity to roll them up. Robert pulled ahead and had the advantage with his bigger dice for most of the game, but he was never able to pull too far ahead thanks to the balancing nature of our little hack. I also think it nicely reflects the way it can become a struggle to find things to pick up in the actual game just before you grow enough to grab larger objects, then suddenly when you pass the thresh-hold there's all kinds of things for you to easily get. Anyways, I reccomend you try playing that way and see what you think!<br/><br/>Also, I finished revising the rules based on my first playtest, but I don't want to jump the gun on Stage 1 and put them up too early. What do you think, Mr. Walton?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348773/#Comment_348773" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-12T13:44:21+00:00" title="November 12, 2011  1:44PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is that tonight?

For the most part, it did fairly accurately capture the feel of the source game, with a few instances of die-rolling back and forth as the hero tried to defeat some tougher monsters (1 HP damage here, 1 HP damage there...). I liked it for the most part, but definitely some areas that could use ironing out, which probably Hans will detail better when he posts his audio recording. We used the original set of rules, instead of the 1.3 version, since it was a bit simpler (though in retrospect, we may have wanted to use the addition of Points of Interest).<br/>I think our main thing was that the switching of the roles was more often than not going back and forth between the same two players frequently (typically, monster switches with hero, hero switches with monster, etc.). Because it all centered on the hero, it would sometimes leave some of the other players with little to do except wait for when they could chime in with description. In Silver &amp; White, on the other hand (which we played later that evening), the role switching happens between any of the players. So, basically, if there can be some way for the other roles to tag someone to switch, instead of it being dependent on the hero, that'd be a major improvement.<br/>Other than that, I was kind of thinking that it missed some of the random "A Monster Appears" feel of the source game. Perhaps when the hero ventures out into an area or dungeon of a particular level, each location he enters requires...I dunno...maybe the Monster or Treasure player to make a random Monster roll, 1 die per Level, and each 5 or 6 that comes up is a Level of Monster that appears? So, if you're in a Level 3 area, and the roll results in two hits, the Monster player could introduce two 1st Level monsters or one 2nd Level monster? Just a thought. Boss Monsters would then be found in POIs, perhaps.<br/>Still, I enjoyed it. Quite a lot.<br/><br/>...and as for the blank monster cards, I'll have to post those tonight. Apparently the internet service I have at work has blocked my access to my Mediafire account (it has an annoying habit of tagging things that are file-sharing or P2P as potential security threats, and blocks them...it also prevents me from browsing art on DeviantArt, and sometimes blocks RPGnow...). So I'll have to send the files to my home computer, and then post them from there. Either way, it's only maybe ten hours or so before it'll be available.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orion%20Canning" title="Orion Canning"><img alt="Orion Canning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/119/n90YJAPJ48BYJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orion%20Canning">Orion Canning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348906/#Comment_348906" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-14T17:31:17+00:00" title="November 14, 2011  5:31PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's the same problem we had in our game, for a while we stayed in town while the Monster player was stuck waiting around, and then once we were outside the people player didn't have much to do for a while. I added the scene economy to try to motivate the players to keep moving to new areas, mostly to get them out of town for the benefit of the monster player. I added the POI to have little areas that could be anywhere, which would allow for everyone to switch roles. <br/><br/>Dungeons were intended to do that originally, but in our game the dungeon felt daunting and we were avoiding it until we thought we were strong enough to take it on. Another thing I tried to do in the new rules is make sure treasure, monster, and people had a way to make dragon warrior switch cards with them. So in 1.3, whenever Dragon warrior goes into a building or kills a monster, the treasure player can choose to trade with Dragon warrior, monsters show up wheneverhe goes outside, and people can choose to make people show up. Outside people can make POI to do this too. I tried to strike a balance with areas making you fight a monster when you moved through them. If you get a chance to try the new rules, let me know what you think.

I also stretched my powers of deduction and from the background noise I believe you played at Card Kingdom in Seattle. A fine choice. What was interesting was how differently your group's playstyle was from mine. You guys actually were probably playing more the way it should be played than my group was, truer to the source material. As I said before we spent two hours in town, using lots of detailed description, fleshing out the world and characters with a lot of depth. Not that it wasn't all a bit silly and fun, and colored with Nes Rpg nostalgia, but you guys really understood what the game was about, going out and killing monsters and gaining levels! So I can see how you felt the scene economy I added in the new rules felt overcomplicated, your group wouldn't have needed them. But our group probably needed that push. (well we were having a lot of fun, it's just that the monster player was left out.) <br/><br/>I nerded out a little over your knowledge of the video game, especially when people were humming the theme song. I heard some good criticism in the Ap too, like that 200 gold might be an unbalancing amount to start with (because it probably should be more like 50.), and that the control you get from the explain cards is a little unintuitive and wonky. That comes from me beginning the design from simple narrative elements, then needing to add things for them to do in places where their area of control gave them none. That could be helped with layout (bullet points as it was said in the ap) or just a conceptually stronger distribution of narrative control. It's quite possible the game would work better as a three player game even, but I like that it's four. <br/><br/>Now, if I can get dropbox working on this I pad I can hear the actual critiques you sent me... Ah, there we go. Yeah, I'll definitely work on the layout for the explain cards. You're definitely right that creative description is what keeps the fights interesting, having the characters say a line of dialogue with each attack and describing their moves and the effect they have on each other, and maybe I should instruct players to do that more explicitly? That's also something that spending a little more time in your game on worldbuilding and background would help, finding something that makes you care more about the villains and DW. Oh, and about the idea of rotating cards among all the players instead of just swapping between two, In the new rules you rotate like that when DW levels up. Also, the blank monster cards are perfect, I love them. It makes me wish I was allowed another page to stick them on. Thanks guys, so helpful!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348938/#Comment_348938" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-15T09:09:13+00:00" title="November 15, 2011  9:09AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Orion Canning</cite>I also stretched my powers of deduction and from the background noise I believe you played at Card Kingdom in Seattle.</blockquote>\nActually, Fiction Addiction in North Portland.<br/><br/>...man, sometimes I WISH I could be in Seattle.

I realized that while the rules are done there is still a lot of work to do, because creating the elements necessary for "Stage One" is going to take almost as much writing as the rules did.  So I've decided to create them as two separate documents and go ahead and post the rules now.  I give you...<br/><br/><a href="http://bloodthornpress.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/adaqp_alpharules.pdf" rel="nofollow">A Dark And Quiet Place</a><br/><br/>This is like my 3rd or 4th attempt at a Silent Hill RPG.  The rules make reference to the first location "The Old Toy Factory".  Creating all the materials for that location is what I'm still working on.  You technically don't need them since all the rules for creating those materials are provided.  I want to finish them because (a) they let you jump into the game without doing a lot of prep and (b) they provide nice examples for what I'm talking about in the rules.<br/><br/>Anyway, so there you have my day late, dollar short, broke all the rules "entry" for Stage One.

I figure we should give all the games (even the ones that have already been invited) a couple months to be played and go through any internal revisions by the author.  And then, once it's clear which games still want to be part of the anthology, authors will submit their drafts and we'll put them through the paces during editing, polishing, and layout.  If people want some support or suggested steps to go through in the playtest-and-revise stage, I'll be happy to provide some guidance and even try to play as many of them as I can.  So maybe touch base around the end of December and we'll make plans to put this together early next year?  How does that sound?

I need to think on it in more depth, but some quick notes:<br/><br/>- The setup is fun and grabby.<br/><br/>- What's happening in the fiction isn't particularly important (so the game quickly runs the risk of just being about the players saying "I use my Parkour skill", "I use my Assassination skill").<br/><br/>- The consequences of succeeding and failing at tasks needs to be considered carefully. Currently, I'm thinking that characters 'succeed' at everything. It just might cost them in terms of injuries, damaged skills or introducing new complications.<br/><br/>- I need to figure out how to handle simultaneous challenges - like 'Move the crate through a zone of unstable gantries' and 'Kill all the guards who've suddenly appeared'.<br/><br/>- I need to actually write down my rules for creating the challenges and the map of the areas the game is taking place in, which (at the moment) I think will play best when they're slightly abstracted (like Zones in Spirit of the Century/FATE).<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hopefully Simon will post about Heavy is the Head.

Certainly the game was functional, but I think a few tweaks could make it substantially more fun. <br/><br/>My "People of the Stone" faced pretty tough times, some famine, internal strife, and raids from neighboring tribes. They came through it barely, advancing from a small despotic tribe to a loose confederation of warlords.<br/><br/>My vision for the game was that it would be essentially a facilitated discussion about politics for two people, and I think it modestly succeeds at that. Essentially the game is about deciding what problems you're willing to live with, which I think is an apt description of politics.<br/><br/>It needs a few more rules (a "do nothing" move, for example), and maybe a more concrete relationship between in-game time and turns. It takes a little longer to play through Stage One than I hoped. Maybe 45 mins to an hour, instead of 30 mins. The back-and-forth between player one and player two worked pretty well though, I thought, and we pretty naturally created fictional material.<br/><br/>Steve, how much "fun" would you say you had? I found it pretty fun, but also slightly hard. "Heavy is the Head" indeed. I was ready for my turn as Player One to be over.<br/><br/><b>Fortunes and Thieves</b> was also pretty fun! The initial situation is indeed grabby as heck, and I think with another player there'd be heaps of room for banter and showing off. My favourite bit was imagining lots of cool action scenes, and thinking about how it would look "in the movie". I don't know Uncharted at all, so I don't know how well the game fit the game, so to speak. It felt like a kind of modern pulp, Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider kind of thing. Style over substance, set piece action sequences glued together with funny characters and some dialogue.<br/><br/>Steve I think you've outlined the problems pretty well. I like the idea of "You always succeed but sometimes face consequences".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349312/#Comment_349312" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-20T18:46:55+00:00" title="November 20, 2011  6:46PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I saw "Meek's Cutoff" last night, and now I wish I'd done an Oregon Trail game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349318/#Comment_349318" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-20T23:23:58+00:00" title="November 20, 2011 11:23PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, I started off a little confused about what my role (as Player 2) was in the game, and then began having an increasing amount of fun as I realised that my role was to:<br/><br/>a) build up a coherent story about what was going wrong with your society (putting pressure on you to make decisions and act), and <br/>b) slowly define what could be waiting for you off in the blank squares of the map (for instance the raiding parties initiating reprisals on your city).<br/><br/>FYI: Here's a link to <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1164498/Heavy%20is%20the%20Head.pdf" rel="nofollow">Heavy is the Head</a><br/><br/>Like I mentioned, by about Turn 4 I was starting to wonder whether there was anything 'extra' to the game or whether it would basically be me putting pressure on you, you making decisions, and the two of us building up a coherent setting that the action was taking place in. However, I can definitely see potential in having us swap roles during Stage 2 of the game. I'd like to also propose a variant: that Player 2 creates their own civilisation that - at some point - intersects with Player 1's. I've got two reasons behind that:<br/><br/>a) I wondered how invested I would be in making decisions for the civilisation you created, and<br/>b) one thing I missed from this game was the sense of a coherent enemy building its power off-screen and having to be defeated.<br/><br/>- - -     - - -     - - -<br/>I have some other observations, but I'll leave it there for the moment.<br/><br/>(Oh, and here's the link to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ssIsQAHp8bLoXZloaAbM9lRR-iUuE4MZWXK2yQRTXW4/edit" rel="nofollow">Fortunes and Thieves</a>.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orion%20Canning" title="Orion Canning"><img alt="Orion Canning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/119/n90YJAPJ48BYJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orion%20Canning">Orion Canning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349329/#Comment_349329" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-21T05:00:04+00:00" title="November 21, 2011  5:00AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Me and Robert played heavy is the head last tuesday and the review I wrote of it didn't actually get posted due to some error. But I'll write a new one.<br/><br/>My tribe lived off of mammoth meat and labor was divided so that young people did hunting and gathering of food, and the older men became soldiers and the older women became medicine women and community leaders. To my right I found an ocean where I could harvest salt but a group of pirates said they owned that part of the sea and wanted me to pay a tribute  of 4 mammoth tusks a month to use it. When I refused they fired on my gatherers and I responded by stealth attacking some of their fishermen, at which point they renegotiated a tribute of two tusks a month which I agreed to.<br/><br/>Then I ran into a rival civilization on my left that worshipped the mammoths and opposed me hunting them. In response I stealth hunted them at night in secret. This led to me accidentally killing some of their priestesses who were wearing mammoth furs and sleeping beside the beasts. My hunters took the bodies to the ocean where the pirates fished, leaving a trail, then dropped the bodies in the water. The pirates pulled up the bodies in their nets and the mammoth worshipping tribe discovered them then, so blamed them for the attacks and went to war with them.<br/><br/>My civilization joined thhem in the war against the sea pirates, but on my next turn I ran into another rival civilization that was a group of horse riding traderswho did buisness with the sea pirates. Together we decided it would be best if I got rid of the mammoth worshippers, so after agreeing to support them in an attack against the sea pirates I secretly pulled my troops away and snuck them into the mammoth worshipper's palace to kill their leaders, then took over the city while their soldiers fell in battle. I expanded into the new city, then at the end of the game I built a wonder, a channel that went all the way from the sea to a port at the new city.<br/><br/>I really liked the game and I thought it did a great job of putting player 1 in the role of a leader with difficult decisions, while exploring the tiles felt just like the video game. I also felt like some more moves could be in order, especially a diplomacy or negotiation option. I had a problem thinking of any other way to respond to rival civilizations other than force with the moves I had. That was also a problem because I had just watched City of Life and Death which is about the japanese occupation of nanking, and after seeing all the war atrocities in that movie I felt pretty icky about playing a pretty brutal civilization, (especially when Robert asked me what I would do with the mammoth priestesses after I conquered their civilization. I sent them to live somewhere else.) I kept feeling like if I had more imagination I could have thought of more peaceful solutions but, the moves just weren't there. Not that your game has anything to do with the rape of nanking or anything. I usually would have more fun playing a conniving backstabber, but at the time I wanted some other options.<br/><br/>It also felt like the game would be fun to play with more players playing different civilizations that run into each other as they develop, like multiple people taking the player one role while player two sort of acted as gm and facilitated their interactions and injected conflict. It's a good game anyways and I would like to play it some more, at least to see what it's like to be player two and to see what happens in stage two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doho123" title="doho123"><img alt="doho123" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doho123">doho123</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349352/#Comment_349352" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-21T11:05:20+00:00" title="November 21, 2011 11:05AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

I'm more than happy to make changes for submittal into whatever book project you are working on, but I also want to work forward and make the game bigger and into a real project of it's own. Also, are we still limited to just 2 pages?

I'm glad the game was fun. It sounds like you invented some cool details for the different civilisations, which I'm glad to hear. I was working hard to make the fiction relevant to the rules of play, in the hope that it would encourage that kind of spontaneous creation.<br/><br/>I think a diplomacy move might be a good idea, or maybe a specific rule for dealing with other civilisations (like the "emmissary" screen in Civ). The game definitely needs a "Do nothing" move for when you decide that the problems aren't worth dealing with, and let them run their course.<br/><br/>The "Stage Two" rules let you invent your own moves to reflect the new political situation. Do you remember where you ended up on the Politics Grid?<br/><br/>Steve,<br/><br/>Good points. I can see what you mean that it's less compelling playing with someone else's civilisation. Bear in mind that you still get the same opening: Describe your throne room, describe your council of advisors, your band of warriors. Name your people, etc. Would that help?<br/><br/>Intersecting Civilisations is an interesting idea. I'm finding it hard to imagine how that would work though, without becoming competitive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349358/#Comment_349358" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-21T12:44:36+00:00" title="November 21, 2011 12:44PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Scott:</b> The original guidelines said, "Contributors get free copies and rights to their games forever."  So that's still the plan.  Basically, I trade you my help in editing and layout for the right to publish a single print run (~100-200 copies) of the anthology, including a version of the first stage of your game.  Since you still own the rights to it, you're welcome to do whatever you want with your game, as well, including publishing it yourself further down the road, in whatever form you like.  If you have any concerns about any of that, I'm happy to discuss alternate plans.  I'm not planning to make money off the anthology, but to publish it at near-cost.  If it ends up being a huge success and I want to reprint the anthology, I'd have to come back to the contributors with a new deal, since the current deal is just for a single run, not in perpetuity.<br/><br/>I'm imagining that, in some cases, editing and polishing the existing drafts will require some expansion beyond the original wordcount.  And the layout may, of course, end up being really different, just due to the dimensions and specifications of whatever print format we end up going with.  So, no, the anthology versions will not necessarily conform to two pages.<br/><br/>Let me know if that's unclear or if you have any other questions!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349635/#Comment_349635" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-24T16:51:39+00:00" title="November 24, 2011  4:51PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Happy Thanksgiving!<br/><br/>Also, <a href="http://corvidsun.com/2011/11/24/stage-one-reviewing-1-2/" rel="nofollow">the next batch of reviews and invitations are up</a>, with about the same mix as the last batch.<br/><br/>I'm in the midst of consolidating all my online crap together, so if you don't recognize things, that's why.

As for your other question, I do think it would be interesting to us to swap roles and for me to play 'your' civilisation. <br/><br/>I feel like I would need more of a sense of ownership, so that it was 'our' civilisation. One way of doing that is what you have in the rules: I narrate the throne room, advisors, etc. To justify this, I'd probably narrate that the ruler had changed to someone new. In our game, for instance, we had just shifted to 'Warlord' status: given that, perhaps one of the young warriors now controlled the warband after your ruler had died in battle.<br/><br/>I can see two benefits to doing that:<br/><br/>1. Civ kinda implies that the civilisation you're controlling is run by an immortal leader who's guiding her people through history. Which seems weird to me. So changing rulers solves that.<br/><br/>2. Changing rulers also gives a sense of time progressing. Time definitely progresses inside a player's five turns: I would say that we probably played out 9 months to 2 years worth of events in your turn. But, depending on how much of an 'epic sweep of history' feel you want Heavy is the Head to have, changing who the fictional ruler is would give us a real incentive to narrate time moving forward in the fiction.<br/><br/>(The other way to create a sense of ownership over the civilisation would simply be to have Player 2 involved in the initial decisions about what the civilisation is.)<br/><br/>- - -     - - -     - - -<br/><br/>Oh, and one other thing: when we started playing the game, I asked you, "How important is it that we keep track of fictional details?" On reflection, I think it's very important - it actually made the game work when I was actively trying to think about the ramifications of your decisions and the implications of the antagonistic forces I'd introduced ... for example, the increasing discontent of the youthful warriors in your civilisation, or my decision that the cities you'd raided off the edge of the map would retaliate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349753/#Comment_349753" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-27T12:27:02+00:00" title="November 27, 2011 12:27PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve,<br/><br/>Changing rulers: Definitely. The text isn't explicit about it, but it sphould be. It's a new era, with new problems and new opportunities. It's one of the reasons I think I might need to be more explicit about the relationship between turns and in-game time. "Epic sweep of history" is the scope, rather than "day-to-day minutiae". The next player's turn could be 50 or 100 years after the previous.<br/><br/>Interesting about Player Two being more involved in creating the culture. I feel like in many ways you were quite involved in creating the culture. But a few concrete choices at the start might enhance that. "Player Two: Describe the gods these people worship, describe the lands surrounding their village, describe their means of subsistence." Or something like that?<br/><br/>Oh! Player One needs a "describe your treasure room and its stockpile of wealth" step, so that when you're engaging in public works you can be specific about what you're spending, rather than nebulous resources.<br/><br/>Keeping track of fictional details is important. I'd like to think that there's not more detail than you can easily hold in your head or jot down on the map. But yeah, it's important to remember details about the threats and the civilisations resources.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349810/#Comment_349810" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-28T12:01:34+00:00" title="November 28, 2011 12:01PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We playtested <i>Return to Maniac Mansion</i> last night.

I was the Danger Master and I had a lot of fun playing the game, especially making the treasure map. Drawing a bunch of unexplained pictures and interpreting them into locations as we play is really fun. It was quickly claimed by one of the players but I think there's a picture of the map from my game somewhere... Anyways, the game was a lot of fun. The group was looking for Oskaars golden platter off the north tip of Norway. The first scene was in a derelict airport pilot's lounge and bar, filled with some less than friendly characters. I decided the locals would see the PCs as foolish foriegners and tried to get them to leave before they wound up as another group of missing tourists. The players didn't appreciate their attitude much though. Oops. They went into a mysteriously out of place jungle with giant bugs and animals and had a fight with a local tribe of monkeys and some very rickety suspension bridges over rivers of lava. Then they went on to an ice maze that was actually a crypt full of ghosts and undead skeletons. That's actually as far as we got. <br/><br/>The game had a few sticky points. One thing was it went a little gonzo, which I think happened for a few reasons. First off, being a game based on cartoons and animal people I don't think he players were shooting for high level of realism in the first place. On top of that some players just weren't connecting well to their characters or the fiction. That could be solved by adding another step to fleshing out characters and their motivations. Last, when players failed multiple times while trying to defeat a detail in a peril, they often used up all their good ideas in the beginning and got sillier and sillier as it went on. Another problem I had was I felt apprehensive about using gems to injure or capture players because both effectively removed them from play and I didn't think that would be much fun for them. Also the players wanted to interract with each other more during conflicts. We were also not sure how it should be decided who got gold coins or who won a conflict in a tie. I think if the DM moves were more fun for the players and didn't force the GM to single out players to be left out and those rules were clarified the game would go a lot smoother. The treasure map felt like the strongest part of the game (at least on the DM side). <br/><br/>Mr Walton, I'm also curious whether the 2 page requirement is for the final product or not. I'll be revising Dragon and Warrior again soon, and I'm thinking of trying to cut some parts of the game back, like getting rid of money and shops so that all items come from the treasure player, changing the combat system, and making a more defined stage 1, but especially with the stage 1 description it mightbe hard to keep everything to 2 pages.<br/><br/>Oh, also, I'll make it badass.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson" title="Mike_Olson"><img alt="Mike_Olson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson">Mike_Olson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350524/#Comment_350524" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T08:46:49+00:00" title="December  5, 2011  8:46AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

The four initial invitees have all tentative agreed to participate, which means the anthology project can move forward.  It's not clear yet what the MAX number of games that can fit in the first anthology booklet will be, but 4 was my minimum.  Depending on final page count, we may be able to fit a couple more in, starting with the next ones that are revised and recieve invitations.  And once the first booklet is done, I'm happy to plan for a second one with whatever the next batch of revised games is.  And then quit or launch a new Stage One design event whenever we run out of interesting games to work on.<br/><br/>I've updated <a href="http://corvidsun.com/2011/12/18/stage-one-tracking-progress/" rel="nofollow">the tracking page</a> with more information about moving towards completion of the anthology, and will continue to update it as we gets closer.  Yes, we already have one game ready for editing!<br/><br/>So, for those folks working on revisions (1) the sooner you turn them in, the more likely it is your game can fit in the first anthology; but (2) don't panic, because there will probably be more than one booklet.  Plus, if you decide the anthology isn't for you, great!  I'll be happy to help support anything else you want to do with your game.<br/><br/>I'm also happy to review any other Stage One games whenever people finish them, even if they're started long after the initial event, and consider them for later anthologies, assuming we get that far.<br/><br/>Now, to try to get things for Magic Missile in order as well....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352022/#Comment_352022" name="Item_166" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-20T09:05:09+00:00" title="December 20, 2011  9:05AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Given how little interest Lost Colony has garnered I'm seriously considering doing a bit of refactoring to make it a 1-N player game, so I can seriously playtest it myself and bring out the fun more prominently.

I'm definitely interested in whatever direction you end up taking it.<br/><br/>I tried out <i>Half of Everything is Luck</i> on Sunday night, just running through the first location, "Drop Zone."  I've posted PDFs of the map and my makeshift record sheet <a href="http://corvidsun.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/dropzone.pdf" rel="nofollow">up here</a>, if folks are interested.<br/><br/>I tried to use the new gun rules, but forgot about the guard minimums and only had three on the map (and none in the tower). Used up 29 ticks, killed all three guards. Took out the two Guard-6s with a double-Aimed PP7 (6d6), then grabbed a AF7 off one of the bodies and gunned down the last Guard-4 after Aiming (6d6 again). All three times, I didn't roll any 1s, so I guess all that aiming and careful shooting means I'm conserving ammo.  Haven't even been shot at yet, much less taken harm, but I decided not to climb the tower for the Sniper Rifle, since I'm worried I'm cutting it close on time.<br/><br/>The guns are fun but feel a little bit off, stat-wise, especially the long range on the PP7 and the ability to aim it, so you can rack up a lot of dice much more quickly than the Sniper Rifle.  I sent Mike some thoughts on this, but the foundation here is really solid and the remaining issues can definitely be resolved with some playtesting and tweaking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352056/#Comment_352056" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-20T14:40:03+00:00" title="December 20, 2011  2:40PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Mendel, i totally misread\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>refactoring to make it a 1-N player game</blockquote>\nas "...make it a game for a total of 1 minus <i>n</i> players", which worked out in my head to "either 1 player or 0 players, or perhaps less"<br/><br/>which is to say, my mind is severely blown and i have to stop and think about a new design direction now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson" title="Mike_Olson"><img alt="Mike_Olson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson">Mike_Olson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352060/#Comment_352060" name="Item_169" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-20T15:30:07+00:00" title="December 20, 2011  3:30PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>All three times, I didn't roll any 1s, so I guess all that aiming and careful shooting means I'm conserving ammo.  </blockquote>\nExactly! Functioning as designed!<br/><br/>I think what feels weird about the guns right now is the use of the term Rate of Fire, and the fact that Aiming counter-intuitively <i>doubles</i> Rate of Fire. That was just a mechanical shortcut, but in the revision all of that will get some cleaning-up. It's really more accurate if Aiming grants bonus dice to roll depending on the weapon used, and it'd help to rename ROF to something less concretely associated with ammo. For example, the sniper rifle is fairly useless unless you're aiming, in which case it's usually a one-shot-killer.\n<blockquote>Haven't even been shot at yet, much less taken harm, but I decided not to climb the tower for the Sniper Rifle, since I'm worried I'm cutting it close on time.</blockquote>\nThis sounds pretty normal for Agent. Should be worse on the Roadway and Dam, though, as the guards' numbers increase.\n<blockquote>The guns are fun but feel a little bit off, stat-wise, especially the long range on the PP7 and the ability to aim it, so you can rack up a lot of dice much more quickly than the Sniper Rifle.  </blockquote>\nLooking at it again, the PP7's range definitely needs to be taken down a notch or two -- like maybe 5/10. It's a tough one, though. The AF7's kinda super-inaccurate if you're just burst firing unless the target's pretty close to you, whereas the PP7 is a little more accurate when left to auto-aim but doesn't zoom while aiming. Like I said, more research may be required. It's hard work, sure, but I'm willing to put the time in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352075/#Comment_352075" name="Item_170" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-20T17:58:05+00:00" title="December 20, 2011  5:58PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also couldn't find anything saying what gun you start with, if any, though the new rules say you start with PP7 ammo.
