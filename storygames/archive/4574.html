You might be serving your table better, and come to that distinction I'd pick the table any day of the week, but you're essentially saying "this system doesn't matter."</blockquote>\nI have to disagree Judson. I think Dogs very explicitly is about what you are or are not willing to do in order to win. If you're playing a character that's willing to shoot your brother to stop him from drinking, ok. You win! But if you're not (and I'm typically playing "me" in Dogs), what do you do if he pushes things? It asks the question, "what is winning this conflict really worth?" Ultimately, Dogs can push you to the point where winning is easy but victory is impossible. For me, that's the good stuff.<br/>The meat of my whole point about Dogs is that it runs <em>just fine</em> without using the narration of a raise as the basis of where conflict goes.  <br/><br/>"What you'll do to win" exists in the text in the form of escalations.  Will you shoot your brother to stop him drinking?  If so, <em>escalate to shooting</em>, don't give because he says "if you want to stop me, you'll have to shoot me."  <br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is that I admire the design of Dogs for exactly this reason.  When I play Dogs, that's what's fun to me.  If you make a raise against me that sends a shiver down my spine with your last to dice that I can reverse with the dice in front of me?  I'll reverse it, and the raise I send back will break whatever spirit was behind your raise.  If you push forward a 9, and your raise is weak, and I can't even take the blow all the way, I'll find the soft core of my character you've touched on.  Part of the joy is raising to the narrative challenge that poses.<br/><br/>I'm saying: that's the fun I have with Dogs.  You can have your "narrative wall" fun if you want, and we might even be able to have fun at the same table.  <br/><br/>But James is not alone in telling me that I'm having badwrongfun, which is doubly disturbing, since I see this as part of how awesome the Dogs rules are.  But hey, your table, your system.  Just let me have mine.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103485/#Comment_103485" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T13:40:33+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  1:40PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2007 1:58PM by Jesse.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn.

It might better illuminate to all where I'm coming from.<br/><br/>A fifteen year old girl who has been sleeping around with married men in the town is cornered in the general store. She has a gun. The Dogs set their Stakes as, "Make her realize she needs help." Some talking had happened and I had the girl escalate rapidly to gunfighting. One player after having successfully Dodged her bullets Raised with, "I hug her." I was so moved by the image of the Dog embracing her and her collapsing like a little girl crying in his arms that I Gave despite having a few more mechanical options left to me. I still had valid dice, I still had a few blank traits on my NPC sheet.<br/><br/>A lieutenant of the territorial authority is holding one of the members of the town prisoner. The Dogs set their stakes as "They turn the prisoner over to us." Early on (through Just Talking raises) I made it very clear I was going to take this to gunfighting if necessary and at that moment I was anticipating a really bad shoot out. It was a group conflict on my side so I had a TON of dice. One of the Dogs looked at all those dice and gave. But one player was very determined and eventually raised with, "I take his hand and put his gun in my mouth and dare him to pull the trigger." Neither side had escalated past Just Talking so I had plenty of options available that didn't require going to Gunfighting. Again, I gave because I was actually quivering with the tension of the scene and... and.... nope just couldn't go on. That raise was just too badass.<br/><br/>Probably the seminal moment of our whole Dogs campaign. The Dogs take this about-to-be-married couple to the back room of the church. The Dogs know these two are part of a cult. Everyone at the table, including myself is anticipating a conflict. The players are gearing up to start at Gunfighting and set the stakes as "We Kill Them." Then I have a flash and just say, "I Give. You execute them."<br/><br/>In all cases I was "just playing the character" or at least expressing how I felt about the character.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103493/#Comment_103493" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T14:24:21+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  2:24PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2007 2:28PM by Jogesh EZ.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>"What you'll do to win" exists in the text in the form of escalations.

I can see your point - I can even empathize, because in a lot of games, I would look to my ideas about the interior state of a character, or statements I wanted to make about him to make the kinds of decisions we're talking about.  But to say I'm not using Dogs to it's maximum effect, when my your admission you're not understanding what I'm doing or why - a little hurtful, to be honest.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Actually, funny, I don't really understand how you two are disagreeing.

But the view I'm trying to express, that I find very fulfilling about Dogs is that, it can be at least as interesting to see where mechanical choices will take you.  <br/><br/>And honestly, nothing in the rules says I'm ever really presented with shooting my brother, unless I'm out of dice and decide to escalate to shooting.  He puts my gun in my mouth?  "I pull it out, and look at him.  'Don't be a damned child.'"<br/><br/>And what I'm trying to say is that the fiction that results, that you discover in this weirdly consistent but random fashion, is much more satisfying for having risen to the challenges presented by the dice than the more natural decisions we make when we say "oh wow, that was just awesome.  I give."  Because after we play together for a little while, I know my fellow-players buttons, and if they'll let me get away with it, I will hammer on them every time to 'win.'

How can I justify reacting to a weak raise as if it were a strong one? I've got dice telling me that its weak. Saying "Luke, I am your father" while pushing forward two 1's can't be the equivalent of that same phrase backed up by two 6's. What's the mechanic for if a weak raise is treated like a strong one due to the narrative impact upon the player? Where is all this inner turmoil coming from? Its not reflected in the Dice. He's not taking any blows."<br/><br/>However, Jesse and others have related times when they did just that to good dramatic effect. John's quote (and Vincent's parenthetical) shows that in the game as written, the option to Give is totally at the players option. Any reason seems justified--don't care about the stakes, don't want the fallout, don't want to escalate, want a follow-on conflict, etc. But hey, we don't have to go by the Book. We can ask, "Should the decision to Give only be about avoiding fallout and avoiding escalation?" I've got a problem with that because it assumes that once my Dog hits his brother, he's forced to keep hitting him until he's out of dice or afraid of taking any more beating. I think its perfectly reasonable that I could hit my brother and then think "Hey, I don't want to hit my brother anymore" even though I've got the dice to knock him into next Tuesday. But, again, the problem is my dice don't force this decision. I've got the dice to hit him. His raise was weak. What's stopping me other than my feeling that "That's not how my character would behave?"<br/><br/>And here's the thing. Lots of Dogs is outside the mechanics. Stakes-setting itself is not based on a mechanic. There's no dice roll that forces you into a conflict over your brother's drinking. There's no text that says you must confront all sinners immediately and enter into conflict. Those choices are purely player driven. You could sell your guns, give up the Faith, and run off with the circus. There's no mechanic to stop you. If the decision to get into conflicts is up to the players, why should the decision to get out of them be constrained by what dice you're showing? Ultimately, I think the game doesn't force this decision because it wants the question "How does a Dog behave?" to be front and center. Its about that question and how you struggle with it. And it basically accepts your answer without second guessing it.<br/><br/>OK, now I'll stop talking about a game while the designer himself is in the room (What nerve!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103615/#Comment_103615" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T07:20:26+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  7:20AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James, I like your ideas and would like to subscribe to your newsletter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103679/#Comment_103679" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T10:14:52+00:00" title="October 18, 2007 10:14AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br/>\n  I don't know. I sort of understand both sides of this argument. I totally understand wanting to play the character true to their nature and giving, even when the dice are on your side. I mean, that is one way to exactly interpret How far will you go to win (i.e., This far and no further).<br/>\n  And I totally understand the idea of pushing it as far as you can and letting the dice inspire you interpret the results through the eyes of your character. I mean, you get the dice from the traits of your character that you brought into play. So, theoretically, those dice represent just how strongly your character feels. And that is totally a way to interpret exactly How far will you go to win (i.e., As far as the dice will take me).<br/>\n  I think the argument we are having springs from this concept put forward of a "Narrative Wall" meaning that the game only works if you are willing to push other up against it and they you. But, I think, for many people this narrative wall doesn't exist. We play our character full bore (as the setting suggests) and we pull in traits that are relevant to the conflict at hand, even escalating if the issue is that important to our character. Don't get me wrong, there is the possibility that we are just playing to the so-called narrative wall instinctively and not processing it as a real phenomenon. But I feel uncomfortable defining play by such a phenomenon. That somehow my choices are further constrained. If you look at ditv, play choices are fairly well constrained as is. You are limited by role (you play a Dog), by Traits, by narration, by social contract, etc. I feel like adding one more constraint might break the game...<br/>\n  Maybe I am over-reacting, but I have had time to think about it and phrase a response, so my guess would be no.  In all likelihood, this Narrative Wall concept exists, but I don't think it defines play as strongly as the originally posited theory suggests. I think it is a tangible part of play that most people internalize as 'I don't want to do that,l it would not be fun for me/my character.' Or that may just be a reflection of the games/people I play with...<br/>\nDave M<br/>\nAuthor of Legens of Lanasia (Still in Beta)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103694/#Comment_103694" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T11:23:26+00:00" title="October 18, 2007 11:23AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>James, I like your ideas and would like to subscribe to your newsletter.</blockquote>\nNow I'm blushing                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103880/#Comment_103880" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-19T13:07:43+00:00" title="October 19, 2007  1:07PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, it seems to me the argument goes like this: <br/><br/>Judson: I use the dice to see what my character does, and then use my moral judgement to determine how that works out.<br/><br/>Some other folks: I use my moral judgement to see what my character does, and then the dice to see how that works out.<br/><br/>.... <br/><br/>Which, you know, seems okay to me. In either case you've got the dice and moral judgement being used to drive the game and build understanding, conversation, and tension. Its just a different preference as to how we drive at which point, right? <br/><br/>For myself, I suspect I do a little of both. When I'm a player I'm far more likely to decide, then let the dice see how it works out. But when I'm a GM? My NPCs more often than not have a good part of their response dictated by how the dice fall. If the first conflict I'm in with the Steward and he has all these dice left to molly-whop the characters with, but one of them makes a good argument, chances are I'm going to decide he's an ass and is going to push it because the dice say he can. It makes playing NPCs easier, let me tell you. <br/><br/>And yea, even when I'm a PC I'll sometimes get to a point where I'm not sure what the character is going to do, not sure what I want to say at the moment, or am unsure of what the thing is going to mean until after it is over, and make my decision by looking at the table and seeing what kind of dice I've got. The genius of Dogs is that both things work, and give more tools.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
