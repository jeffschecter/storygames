Unfortunately for me someone else designed a really good system that I would dearly love to steal. That system is the karma mechanic in Tenra. I mention that up front because there will be some similarities with my ideas, not least of all because they share some similarities: martial arts and melodrama.<br/><br/>I want a metagame mechanic of this nature because it adds depth to the experience, but it has to be subtle, unobtrusive and simple. Firstly there are two things about the system (as it currently stands) that need to be explained:<br/>1. the resolution is a d6 pool summed and compared to a TN/opposing value, like the classic d6 system.<br/>2. heroes act first in combat unless the GM interrupts.<br/><br/>The idea I have currently is thus:<br/><br/>Each hero has a trait - these would be the melodrama aspects like Tenra's fates, but not dissimilar to Callings in Marvel Super Hero Adventure Game. This trait has a strength value. We will call this trait a Destiny, for now.<br/><br/>(I mention Marvel because its character Callings are apposite and because it allows for heroes to change from being a brash young warrior to a world weary recluse, which is the purpose of these mechanics and the function of TBZ's Karma system - and thus what I am trying to accomplish).<br/><br/>When a hero rolls, each die that rolls no greater than the strength of his Destiny, regardless of the action, generates a point of what we will call Karma. These are points that can be used by the GM to add to his rolls and to interrupt heroes in combat (and more probably).<br/><br/>Spending a Karma point turns it into a Fortune point for the hero. These can be used to give extra dice, or do a bit of healing. <br/><br/>Spending a Fortune point turns it into a point of XP. As does giving a point to another hero.<br/><br/>Destony scores change according to the behaviour of the hero.<br/><br/>The most important issue, other than whether this process fits the desired criteria (subtle and simple - the game shouldn't be dominated by this, but influenced like a current), is the definition of Destinies. Some of the fates i've seen for TBZ characters seem like they'd be confusing in play: 'longing for a family', how does that work? Does the player say 'i wish i had a mummy and a daddy' and get points? Whereas something like 'abides by the teachings of buddha' seems more appropriate - a hero that won't break his code is going to be in a position to put himself in risky situations as a result and therefore receive an appropriate reward. <br/><br/>Also my idea hinges on the score of the trait, if the hero has multiple traits, which would otherwise seem appropriate, then he risks giving karma out constantly depending on their scores. The point isn't to limit the generation of Karma to the action described or implied by the trait, it's to generate 'consequence' every time he acts.<br/><br/>I am not entirely clear how the value should increase. Ostensibly Destiny values would change solely depending on character behaviour: the buddhist that gives in to Green Snake's temptation is going to adversely affect his Destiny. But i've always found that a bit vague; how do you arbitrate these things? perhaps a simple XP cost would be better but that misses the point doesn't it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
