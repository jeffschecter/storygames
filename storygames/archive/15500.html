Just a heads up I'm publishing my first novel.  As the series name suggests I am writing a western dime novel set in Louisianna during the Civil War.  For more info on that check this out:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doncorcoran/a-road-paved-in-iron-a-voodoo-western-dime-novel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doncorcoran/a-road-paved-in-iron-a-voodoo-western-dime-novel</a><br/><br/>So why here? Well, aside from many of my friends hanging here one of the rewards is a short-form RPG.  It's a scene based Western that focuses on stories told about the pull of belief in the voodoo tradition.  As players accomplish social goals they decide how much they buy into voodoo.  The more they do the more influence they have over the story but the more vulnerable they are to voodoo in the tale.<br/><br/>Anyway, I plan on chatting more about that this month.<br/><br/>Thanks for your support and if you love Westerns please spread the word about my Kickstarter campaign.  If we reach our goals by December 22nd I will send the first PDF as gifts by the December 24th.<br/><br/>-Don                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353068/#Comment_353068" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-03T17:43:42+00:00" title="January  3, 2012  5:43PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I posted about the game on my blog, here: <a href="http://realityvault.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://realityvault.blogspot.com/</a><br/><br/>Here is what it says.<br/><br/>***<br/>So lets talk a little about my new RPG.<br/><br/>It's called Voodoo Western Dime novel.  It is based on the setting developed for my series of the same name.  The RPG is a reward as part of the series's Kickstarter project which can be found here: <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doncorcoran/a-road-paved-in-iron-a-voodoo-western-dime-novel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doncorcoran/a-road-paved-in-iron-a-voodoo-western-dime-novel</a>.  By pledging $75 you get a print version of the RPG, a signed paperback of the novel, a t-shirt with the Voodoo Western logo emblazoned on it, a keyring of the same design and a PDF copy of both the RPG and the novel.  If we get to $6000 I will throw in a signed print copy of the second book as well.<br/><br/>I had a few design goals and after plugging away at a number of options I think I found the game that I want to see in print.<br/><br/>Here are my design goals:<br/>A game driven by player choices - the books are definitely character oriented.  To emulate that the story has to be in players hands pushing toward their own ideologies and their goals coming into conflict with one another.  This would be one of the first "sandbox" games I have written in quite a while.<br/><br/>Clear play procedures - I don't want the game to flag due to lack of focus.  I want it to be clear to players what they are doing at the table.  I believe that if the players know their roles and how to play the game they won't stray into extraneous directions.  I wanted to create the illusion of freedom yet give players clear mechanical benefits to drive toward.<br/><br/>The system behind the scene - This was the most difficult of my design constraints.  How do you create a story first game that players can truly engage with THE GAME yet not feel like what they are doing is necessarily mechanical.  There was a line I was definitely straddling here. Compromises were made especially in regards to scene setting  and resolution mechanics.  I don't like randomness.  I had to develop something random that moves the story in interesting directions while putting the action in players hands.<br/><br/>Small investment of time - I like games I can jump right into.  First off I wanted to spread the authorship around a bit.  I didn't want to go crazy and have a few secrets thrown into the plot but I really felt like if everyone participated in fleshing out the setting, characters, et al there would be an expanded investment in the game among players.  However, it's not compulsory.  You could play this game with a traditional GM role and the other players not adding much to the setting.  I added this so players who wanted a more first person experience could engage without feeling pressured to add anything to the narrative other than their character's involvement.<br/><br/>My first few attempts ran the gamut.  I had a Ghost Echo inspired game pointing to the most evocative elements of the setting.  While I think the game is brilliant I decided it wouldn't afford backers with a sense of value nor would it create an immersive game as I envisioned it.<br/><br/>The second try was a card based game.  I may release the card game in the future (maybe even just as a card game with a Voodoo Western theme deck.  I liked the rules and I think it did some interesting things but it was too clunky and scene-framey for what I was looking for.  I've played too may "now frame the scene" games of late and it wasn't what I was looking for in this game.<br/><br/>I kept a set of raw statistics with internal balance and a quick resolution system.  It's deterministic with a point based economy.  I saw a dance in my book, individuals bringing their expertise to bear, jockeying for power and influence, using tools and people to help them achieve their goals.  I was immediately reminded of Amber, Nobilis and Gumshoe.  In the game you have four statistics - physicality, wits, community and voodoo.  You compete initially in ranking those stats so there is a clear pecking order among the players.  You know that guy is better at physical confrontation then you are.  Maybe you know he's faster or stronger.  But you also know you are smarter than he is.  In Amber, and hopefully in Voodoo Western, this creates a social dance to change the obvious field of battle among players.  If you want to achive certain goals you may need to find someone better at those types of conflicts than you.<br/><br/>Players have every reason to interact with the environment.  Places in the setting are assigned mechanical benefits, as are goods and people.  When you need to do something in the story that allows you to fulfill your goals you may "visit" people, places and things to help you do so which, themselves, provide new challenges.<br/><br/>All to the beat of Events in character's lives that drive them to one or more goals.  While you could just play out "a day in a life" having goals is a powerful way to propel your character into their story or the story of others, especially when those goals are at odds.  By completing goals the player gains mechanical and narrative influence pushing them toward greater and greater goals.<br/><br/>Finally, there is an advancement system in place.  While the story builds and what the characters are doing develops the characters change.  This change is qualitative instead of quantitative.  Instead of numbers increasing and outstripping the resolution mechanics the game may require players to shift the pecking order around.  Characters develop specializations, gain and lose good, meet and piss off more people and gather a collection of influence but their statistics never rise above the rank system.<br/><br/>What they do is broaden the situations they can levy said influence thus making where you go and the initial pecking order more important in later stages of the game.  After a short while playing who will win conflicts will be easy to determine.  It's character interactions and the occasional card draw (done when you encounter new things in the game) that may change the situation.<br/><br/>There's two weeks left on the Kickstarter.  I'll be running more and more play-testing throughout that time before release.  Of course, there will most likely be a release of a revised edition by the end of the Voodoo western series as more and more people play it.<br/><br/>This project means a great deal to me.  There is a great deal of time and effort put into its characters and setting and I really want to see players be able to tell the same sorts of stories I tell in my novels.  I don't expect topic specific content, like commentary on race or the civil war but I hope the conflict system, player driven narrative and an evocative setting laid out in the novels will inspire yarns of betrayal, eerie bargaining and heroism reflected in the series.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354073/#Comment_354073" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-12T11:10:43+00:00" title="January 12, 2012 11:10AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will be running this at Dreamation as a Beta Playtest.
