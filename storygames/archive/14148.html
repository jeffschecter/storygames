You can find the rules here: <a href="http://www.halfmeme.com/nicotinegirls.html" rel="nofollow">Nicotine Girls RPG</a>. The archetypal Nicotine Girls movie is Ghost World. The most extreme version I can think of is Winter's Bone.<br/><br/>I've been wanting to write some play advice for this game for a while. (Full disclosure: I haven't played Nicotine Girls yet.) Here's what I prepped in order to run Nicotine Girls at Kapcon this year - it combines advice from three articles I think are relevant:<br/><br/><a>How to run Nicotine Girls by droog</a><br/><a href="http://www.pelgranepress.com/?p=3468" rel="nofollow">Create a Joker for their Batman by John Stavropoulos</a><br/><a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/163/antagonism-101/" rel="nofollow">Antagonism 101 by Ben Robbins</a><br/><br/>And I got lots of great insight in this thread: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13477&amp;page=1#Item_12" rel="nofollow">Nicotine Girls: Creating painfully unsuccessful failures</a><br/><br/>I think there's four posts in this. Here's the first one - it's pretty sketchy and I imagine it can get fleshed out a fair bit.<br/><br/><br/><b>HOW TO RUN NICOTINE GIRLS</b><br/><br/><b>Set up the Game</b><br/>Introduce the idea of Lines and Veils. Don't define anything yet. Mention that the game may deal with difficult subjects.<br/><br/>Decide whether to set the game within a specific time frame. For example, one week before the store the girls are working in closes down.<br/><br/><br/><b>Start with a Day in the Life.</b><br/>As GM, you should have empathy for the Girls.<br/><br/>Ask questions about what they do during their day. Make their world come to life. Make their lives kinda shitty.<br/><br/>Have scenes between the Girls. Ask questions to find out what the Girls want from (a) their Dream, (b) their real life.<br/><br/><br/><b>Understand the Girls\u2019 Dreams and backgrounds.</b><br/>During this, take note of the Girls' character traits and beliefs. Figure out what they care about. <br/><br/><br/><b>Show the Girls' dreams passing them by</b><br/>In his game Acts of Evil, Paul Czege describes how he starts a game of Nicotine Girls:<br/><br/>"Running a playtest of Nicotine Girls back in 2003, I naturally fell into framing opening scenes for each character that could be interpreted as her Dream passing her by. And that was all it took to hook the player."<br/><br/>Now that you know each Girl's dream, figure out a way to show<br/>- how someone else may get it, instead<br/>- how the opportunity may disappear<br/>- her personal circumstance might prevent her from getting it<br/>- [<i>... something else</i>]<br/><br/>It's important here to not close off the possibility of the Girl achieving her dreams. Just threaten it. In Apocalypse World terms, make a soft move rather than a hard move.<br/><br/><br/><b>Types of NPCs</b><br/>Create NPCs who:\n<ul><li><b>exaggerate</b> these traits and beliefs (Extremists)<br/></li><li><b>complicate </b>the traits and beliefs, wanting to try different methods to achieve the same aim (Challengers) <br/></li><li><b>conflict </b>and disagree with those traits (Rivals)</li></ul>\nWhen creating NPCs be sure to reuse NPCs. Make sure that one NPC combines aspects from several different Girls.<br/><br/>Build up a list of NPCs with: (a) agendas of their own, and (b) a desire to keep the Girl stuck where she is<br/><br/>Other types of NPCs include:\n<ul><li><b>Creeps </b>(who hit on you)<br/></li><li><b>Losers</b> (who try to impress you, but drag you down)<br/></li><li><b>Weirdos </b>(who try and engage with you)<br/></li><li><b>Authorities </b>(who know better than you, control you)<br/></li><li><b>Do-Gooder</b>s (who try to understand or save you in a way that\u2019s not helpful)</li></ul>\nNext up, scene framing and moves for Nicotine Girls                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320848/#Comment_320848" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T16:13:59+00:00" title="April 15, 2011  4:13PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 18, 2014 2:55AM by Steve_Hickey.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>SCENE FRAMING</b><br/><br/>If the player has added a Fear, then build a scene around introducing that Fear.

Smoke scenes can be with another Girl or an NPC (player's choice). <br/><br/>If they choose an NPC, feed the Girl advice that goes against her Dream.<br/><br/><b>Does the Girl take the advice?</b>\n<ul><li>If yes, add Smoke to Motivation.<br/></li><li>If no, subtract Smoke from Motivation.</li></ul>\n<b>CONFLICTS: DETERMINING THE OUTCOME</b><br/><br/><b>Choose a Motivation</b>:\n<ul><li>If the Girl is Fighting, she has to use Fear as her Motivation.<br/></li><li>If the Girl's Motivation +/- Smoke is zero or negative, then the Girl automatically fails.<br/></li><li>Encourage the player in a conflict to pick up Fear. Remind them they can add to your Fear at any point: choose something from the list. </li></ul>\n<b>Choose Method</b>:\n<ul><li>Sex<br/></li><li>Money<br/></li><li>Cry</li></ul>\n<b>Roll the dice</b><br/>Roll a number of d10s equals to the Girl's adjusted Motivation score. You get a number of successes equal to the number of d10s that are less than (or equal to) your Method score.<br/><br/>If the Girl is Fighting, succeeds on a \u20181\u2019. 1 success will beat a girl, 2 successes will beat a guy.<br/><br/><b>Did the Girl use Hope as her Motivation?</b>\n<ul><li>If she failed, then she cannot use Hope as a Motivation for the rest of the session.<br/></li><li>If she succeeded, she can reduce her Fear score by one.</li></ul>\n<b>CONFLICTS: CREATING THE OUTCOME</b><br/><br/><b>How to narrate successes</b><br/><br/>If the Girl succeeded, her intent is realized. At this point, I'm going off the book and proposing the following:\n<ul><li>If the Girl got one or two successes, then create a successful outcome that is either <b>corrupted</b> (they get what they want but it doesn\u2019t turn out the way they\u2019d hoped) or has <b>consequences</b> (they get what they want but something else bad happens too)<br/></li><li>If they got three or more successes give them what they\u2019ve earned.</li></ul>\nPersonally, I would only push into slightly uncomfortable territory, rather than horrific territory, with these success narrations.<br/><br/><b>How to narrate failures</b><br/><br/>If they failed, their character\u2019s intent is painfully unsuccessful.\n<ul><li>If the Girl used Hope, trash their Dream.<br/></li><li>If they used Fear, worsen an element of one of their Fears.</li></ul>\n<b>Principles for narrating failure</b>\n<ul><li>Reveal an ugly truth<br/></li><li>Betray the Girl<br/></li><li>Mock or humiliate the Girl<br/></li><li>Crush her hopes and aspirations<br/></li><li>Show the Girl how the failure is her fault (implicate her identity, not just external consequences). It wasn\u2019t luck or circumstances that were beyond her control that failed her, it was her own nature.<br/></li><li>Have someone reinforce something toxic and crippling about the Nicotine Girl.<br/></li><li>Take away the Girl\u2019s control of the situation</li></ul>\n<b>For framing the next scene</b><br/>If Fear was added in the conflict, introduce that new Fear as a weave (an element of one Girl's story introduced into the scene of another Girl).<br/><br/><br/><b>ENDGAME</b><br/><br/>I suspect that the best way to handle the Endgame is to have each Girl roll at the moment they could achieve their Dream.. <br/><br/>(a) If you used Hope during the game and you never failed, increase your Hope by 1.<br/>(b) Roll Hope. Count ones as successes. If the player gets two or more successes, then their Girl gets their dreams.<br/><br/>After these individual rolls, Girls can participate via Smoke scenes and being in another Girl\u2019s scene.<br/><br/>Any Girls that don't get their chance to acheive their Dream roll for it simulataneously at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Each player gets to narrate an epilogue for their Girl.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320871/#Comment_320871" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T21:22:03+00:00" title="April 15, 2011  9:22PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Final post. I prepped a character sheet for the game, and decided to provide the players with some advice about how to get the most out of playing Nicotine Girls.<br/><br/><b>PLAYER ADVICE</b><br/><br/>Have sympathy for your Nicotine Girl. Actively try to achieve her Dream.<br/><br/>Work to create an \u2018indie film\u2019 tone: realistic, character-centred.<br/><br/>If you sense a conflict is coming up, call for a Smoke scene. In a Smoke scene you can get advice from someone either another Nicotine Girl or one of the GM\u2019s characters. Tell us who. <br/><br/>If you take the advice, add a number of dice equal to your Smoke score to the conflict roll. If you don\u2019t take the advice, subtract dice equal to your Smoke.<br/><br/>If you\u2019re asked for advice, remember: you can advise your friend to do something that benefits you.<br/><br/>If you use Hope during a conflict and fail, you can\u2019t use Hope again in this game.<br/><br/>You can increase your Fear score at any stage (even during a conflict) by picking an item from the Fear list. This will help you win a conflict but will introduce more chaos into your life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320882/#Comment_320882" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-16T00:33:45+00:00" title="April 16, 2011 12:33AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is hot hot shit, Steve!
