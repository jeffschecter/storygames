I like it and it covers a lot.<br/><br/>I was initially going to say that the main missing item is that rules foster creativity, but "provoke players to say interesting things" is pretty close. I do think of RPG rulesets the way I think of, say, the rules of an improv game, or the "rules" of writing a novel. They're a set of springboards &amp; restrictions that take the creative activity from an impossible &amp; paralyzing place of "well, we can do anything" to a more specific and compelling "we can do <i>this</i>". (Pretty similar to <a href="/forums/profile/Vivificient%27s">@Vivificient's</a> idea of "providing structure", but more about storytelling than procedure)<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, the only real difference between the rules of writing a play and the rules of roleplaying is that an RPG's rules are more granular and detailed. Which, quite frankly, just makes it easier for people who aren't professional creatives to do cool &amp; interesting &amp; creative things in a fictional space.<br/><br/>Another way to put this \u2013 and maybe this even covers all of your more specific points \u2013 is that rules are a way of externally &amp; objectively giving and taking away agency. So determining who gets to act and when (and in what manner), or who (or what) gets to determine outcomes, or arbitrate what's valid \u2013 that's what rules are fundamentally for. Otherwise, you either have a situation where nobody/everybody has equal agency at all times, or a situation where you must agree on who has agency on a case-by-case basis.<br/><br/>Taking Vivificient's example above:\n<blockquote>Like for example, if I'm playing D&amp;D, and I want my knight to attack the ogre, I know that I do that once it's my side's turn, and that to do so I roll a d20 and add my attack modifier, and then the DM will peek at the monster's AC and tell me if I hit. I've done that procedure a hundred times, so I don't need to talk about it or think about it, I just do it and we move on to what's next. Or if we are playing Dungeon World, I know that when I do something that triggers a move, I should roll 2d6+mod and look at the table of outcomes.</blockquote>\nThe rules (independent of anyone at the table) mandate that Vivicent gets agency over their knight character on their turn, then takes that agency and hands it to the d20, the character sheet, and the monster's stats to determine if there's a hit, (and possibly to the DM if they're fudging said stats for story reasons), then back to Vivicent to roll damage, then back to the dice for an outcome, then back to the DM for a resolution, then on to the next player in the order. There's this constant flow of who or what has agency in a scene, which allows for creativity and collaboration in the storytelling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/manixur" title="manixur"><img alt="manixur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/manixur">manixur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471000/#Comment_471000" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-22T20:59:53+00:00" title="March 22, 2018  8:59PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say, briefly, that rules can introduce and focus intention in play. I'm going to hold off on saying that they should, or that this is the cosmic purpose of game rules, because I'm not convinced such a claim is true and not sure I could defend it if I believed it was.<br/><br/>To put it a bit differently, I think that rules frameworks tend to guide play towards certain player motivations and modes of interaction, and pull focus away from interactions and decision-making processes that are peripheral. To use an extreme example, in a hypothetical wargame, the rules might draw you make decisions on a tactical basis in pursuit of an arbitrary operational goal, and tacitly discourage you from examining the justice of the cause or the environmental effects of your decisions. Some wargames can do the opposite. (I'm using "wargames" rather than "RPGs" as the example to avoid implying criticism of specific RPG playstyles.)<br/><br/>In freeform roleplay, on the other hand, even if we come to a detailed explicit agreement about why and how we're playing, we're at risk of diverging from that plan or falling into our habitual modes of interaction in the absence of some kind of third-party reinforcement. If we end up making explicit play procedures to manage this situation, that's great! We've made rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
