Game sessions are 2 and 3 hours.<br/><br/>One game idea is to play people stranded on a deserted island after a ship-wreck or plane-crash.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Characters</span><br/>- Captain, Child, Athlete, Technician, Pregnant Woman, Farmer, Elder, Priest, ...<br/>- Each has strength/weakness<br/>- Each player can choose a personal item and an item of general use that they have with them. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scenes</span><br/>- Survival (Where are we? Who is in charge?)<br/>- Danger (animal attack, weather, ...)<br/>- The Wounded (What to do with the wounded?)<br/>- Natives (build relationship or fight?)<br/>- Escape (rescuers or pirates?)<br/><br/>We also play with two facilitators, so we could bring in additional escalations or play additional characters (i.e. natives).<br/><br/>Any help with brainstorming or other suggestions (perhaps there is already a game for this?) is welcome!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
