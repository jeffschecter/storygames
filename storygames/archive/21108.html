(I don't know it would be needed in most collaborative story games or narratively driven games). Ideally, the players could just bring up their concern with the  situation, but sometimes it can be uncomfortable to do with certain groups or GMs. Perhaps by ritualizing it, it would make players more comfortable to bring up the issue. In short, I think it's a great idea, David :-)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463022/#Comment_463022" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-06T03:13:42+00:00" title="May  6, 2017  3:13AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I was GMing Torchbearer, I would have loved this.

A player cast some spell, not sure what it was, let's say Burning Hands. I said "Ok, two of them get caught in the flames." and proceeded to roll saves. He protested "What, how come you decided on that number?!" and I handed him the index card where I had (between sessions) written down the equations, and he was satisfied. He didn't need to halt the game to have the equations fully explained, he was satisfied that there <em>was</em> a rule.<br/><br/>That's also why I'm making the init flowchart. I used to be pretty arbitrary <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/> which how I made exceptions to the initiative order. If I can encapsulate my thinking in a flowchart, and if there are protests, I can just go "here, we're here" and point to were we are in the flowchart. I can do the same if I flowchartify that formalization of petitioner/granter that I wrote to Hasimir the other day, and the same for finchian trapfinding.<br/><br/>In fact, I'm kinda thinking of making a whole game along these principles. Very few actions, mostly physical dangers, would use dice, and those things wouldn't use numbers, they'd use the old Fudge method of rolling 4dF and moving your finger on the scale for every plus or minus. (Unlike Fate, I'd never rely on degree of success, only on the outcome itself \u2014 yes, that means that every result that beat Great would be Superb or better, but I'd design around that.) Most things would use formulas, heuristics and algorithms. What D&amp;D calls passive skills, I'd leverage a lot, too. The ultimate "Let It Ride". Checking for random events (such as wandering security guards, or a bad mood for your boss) would be another thing where fortune was accountably, probably even visibly, involved.<br/><br/>I'm going for the best of both worlds; the invisibility of 90:s rules-lite games (like Fudge, Over the Edge, SLUG, Window), the sandboxy prep and the accountability I've found the last few years. I wouldn't want to reinvent the wheel, all the games I want to crib from (Fudge, 5e, DW, Dramasystem, Kutulu) are open source.<br/><br/><small>PS. The alternate method I'd put in for those who don't have 4dF would be 2d6 vs 7. Not that 1d6-1d6 bull from Starblazer or that slow 'take the 1-2 as -, 3-4 as blank' from Fate or the (admittedly very good) '4d6 in two colors, the lowest die showing is the result' from the original Fudge . Yes, our beloved AW was on the right track; 2d6 has a close enough curve for all I care (it's the exact same curve as Starblazer but no need to subtract).<br/><br/>Honestly I can't believe they'd go to 1d6-1d6 vs 0 before 2d6 vs 7? Or why Fate would put in that weird "translate the d6:es to dF:s in your mind" method? "4d6 keep the lowest, color determines direction" has amazingly close curve to 4dF already, and Starblazer already relies on two colors, so\u2026 But 2d6 vs 7 has some advantages; you can use any two dice, it's familiar to PbtA players, and you don't have to remember which color is which. I like 4dF better but as a fallback, 2d6 vs 7 is what I would put in.</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463040/#Comment_463040" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-06T16:16:36+00:00" title="May  6, 2017  4:16PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2017 4:18PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_B_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Perhaps by ritualizing it, it would make players more comfortable to bring up the issue.</p></div></blockquote>Yeah.

Or for when the best way to stay in the moment is to get a promise that your question will definitely be addressed later.<br/><br/>This would require at least some small interruption, though, in the form of a note being made so the query isn't forgotten.  Hopefully that could be handled smoothly -- perhaps the GM makes a check mark on a public sheet to acknowledge their obligation, and the player jots a note on their own sheet about what they want answered later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463344/#Comment_463344" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-14T20:56:50+00:00" title="May 14, 2017  8:56PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_B_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Yes, I think this type of card would work well for a D&amp;D 5E game with people you don't know that well.
