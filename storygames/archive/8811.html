I'm re-posting stuff here, because The Forge is the creative game designing think-thank that could really help designing it, but feel free to comment at either place, if you will<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, without further ado, the Big Three Questions for Big Brother Zombie.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the game about?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's about conflict, trust and betrayal under extreme situations, on a closed house and without any chance to get out, where a ravening zombie is occasionally thrust, and/or a corresponding weapon to kill it. As the tension mounts, will it be preferable to kill the zombie to survive and thus win the show, or to kill your fellow contestant that can either help you in a moment or betray you on the next?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do the characters do?<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacters are Contestants on a reality shoe taken to an extreme. Instead of only living mundane and boring situations live, they get the chance to live boring and mundane situation against the undead!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do the players do?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers have direct influence on the game through the Confessionals, a mechanic that works just like those you see on reality shows, influence the conflicts of their characters with others through scaling said conflicts and resolving their consequences, compete for Popularity and trust one another so they can kill zombies.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jrmariano" title="jrmariano"><img alt="jrmariano" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jrmariano">jrmariano</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194937/#Comment_194937" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-01T09:31:53+00:00" title="March  1, 2009  9:31AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            --~~--<br/>\n<br/>\n"Let's meet our Contestants for tonight! Beggining with Marco, a former Marine who has been in jail for assault!" <br/>\n<br/>\nThe characters in BBZ are called Contestants. All Contestants are in the BBZ home for one reason: to be the sole survivor of the game for as long as it lasts in order to win the million dollar prize at the end. They have something dark that leads them to enter the house and these reasons are varied, and they know that although the prize is absolutely fabulous, they only win if they are more courageous, durable and skilled than the rest, not counting the Zombie occasionally released in the House. It's also helpfull if they have a good physical presence for the good viewers at home. <br/>\n<br/>\nEach Contestant in BBZ has Abilities that help in overcoming the various Tasks that will be imposed by Big Brother, has a Skill from his past that it can be useful, and also has a Disorder which may or may not be evident, both for the Contestants and the viewers, but it is there, and it was because of it that the Big Brother management chose them to participate. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen creating their Contestants, each player has 6 points available to divide between the following Abilities: <br/>\n<br/>\nCourage, that helps in resisting the fear of zombies and imposing the Contestant's will on others; <br/>\nPresence, which serves as a measure of the Contestant's charisma and its popularity with the public at home, and finally <br/>\nVigor, which helps in the physical tasks in the house and is essential to resist the fight against the zombies <br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition the player can still choose for his Contestant a Skill from his past thar can be usefull in the house. Some examples are: <br/>\n<br/>\nUsed cars salesman, +1 for Tests of Presence, where you want to convince someone of something extraordinary <br/>\nArrested for assault, +1 for Tests of Courage, for intimidation and violence involving shouts <br/>\nRetired baseball player, +1 for Tests of Vigor, when wielding baseball bats<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are just some examples, players are obviously encouraged to be more creative, but the rule is simple: a Skill is always worth only a bonus of +1, when and only when that condition is met. <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, each Contestant has a Disorder that haunts him inside the house and therefore influences the roleplay of the player, and that will, hopefully!, be a source of Conflicts with other Contestants. <br/>\n<br/>\nA simple list of disorders, which players are encouraged to expand, follows: <br/>\n<br/>\nIs distracted <br/>\nIs lazy <br/>\nInsults people <br/>\nStresses easily<br/>\nIs aggressive <br/>\nIs possessive <br/>\n<br/>\nEach time that, during a Task in the House or in Conflict with other Contestants, or fighting against the Zombies, the player chooses his Contestant to show his Disturbance, then the Contestant gets 1 point of Popularity. There must be, of course, some common sense: an Aggressive Contestatn will not gain more Popularity by constantly fight the Zombies, but a Distracted Contestant will most certainly win a Point of popularity if he forgets to close the door and a Zombie enters the room where everyone is hiding! <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, the Contestant has two aspects that will develop in their stay in the house, their Trust with the other Contestants, and Their Popularity. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Trust starts at 0 for all Contestants, when they still do not know each other and had no opportunity to establish links between them. As these links are being established and strengthened during the stay in the house, this figure will certainly change. The Trust helps the links established with Contestants who are cooperating in an operation, and it is also extremely important if one of the Contestants decides to betray the other! Remember, only one can win the BBZ, and to win means to be the last survivor! <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Popularity begins with a value equal to the Presence -1, and can rise to twice the value of the Presence. Popularity helps the Contestants in the form of extra dice they can add to their pool, during a Test, and goes up by doing things that appeal to viewers at home, like performing their Tasks better that everyone else (even if that means the others cease to trust him!), violence between Contestants, and treachery! <br/>\n<br/>\nThe mechanics for Trust Popularity will be developed in a future post. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease note that there is no reference to life points or similar mechanics in the BBZ: this is will be explained and developed in another post, but should reinforce the following: despite the title, Big Brother Zombie is much more about Conflicts between Contestants, than about shooting the Zombies (although that is also fun).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194944/#Comment_194944" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-01T10:31:01+00:00" title="March  1, 2009 10:31AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're aware of <a href="http://www.e4.com/deadset/" rel="nofollow">Dead Set</a>, right?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rui%21" title="Rui!"><img alt="Rui!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rui%21">Rui!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195074/#Comment_195074" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T12:32:18+00:00" title="March  2, 2009 12:32PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Graham, I'm Rui!, also known as Poacher on rpg.net, and the main designer of BBZ.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was aware of Dead Set some 5 minutes after thinking of BBZ: I did a quick Google search for any games with these points, and instead found Dead Set. Despite the similarities (Big Brother and Zombies), I think the two premises are fundamentally different: one has zombies outside the house, as in a siege situation just like any common zombie flick, the other has zombies constantly thrown purposeflly into the house, to add excitment, drama and violence to the reality show - and the tasks are not about the amount of food the contestants get (as in real life Big Brother), but about which weapons you get, if any.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this clarifies things a bit. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rui%21" title="Rui!"><img alt="Rui!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rui%21">Rui!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196387/#Comment_196387" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-10T06:58:28+00:00" title="March 10, 2009  6:58AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2009 6:59AM by Rui!.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've done and posted Contestants, Conflicts and Zombies! on Ideonauta; I've tried to post it here at Story Games, but kept getting a "Message too big" or something.
