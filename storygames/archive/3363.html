The players have made these guys up for some kind of Team-based RPGA challenge where you take the whole group into a long-ass scenario, then kill it and take its stuff with TEAMWORK!<br><br>They wanted a test run with the team, so I told them I'd run em through some kind of standard WotC module of their level as a test run.<br><br>I find some little short module, because I didn't want to take a ton of time on the thing -- they just wanted to test out combat tactics.  Anyway, it's a big-ass lighthouse.  It's been taken over by a bunch of well-armed ogres and I think some kind of aquatic troll pirate up at the top.  I don't remember the boss, because they never got that far.<br><br>I don't distinctly remember the whole team, but I do remember that they had an Evocation (read: fireball) specialized mage, a Priest that memorized Wall of Flame and then like 3 copies of Flame Strike, and a pyromaniac bard who mixed and used molotov cocktails as her primary method of attack.  The group liked the Fire, I remember that.<br><br>So they go into the tower, and the first floors fine. Quick fight. Look around.  One room is full of buckets of sand.  Another one's full of loose sand, and empty buckets.  Another's full of barrels of oil.<br/><br/>One of the players figures it out pretty quick: the sand is to fight oil fires, and the oil is for the huge lamp in the lighthouse.  Interesting.<br/><br/>Next floor. Bigger fight, and this time the group is split between two rooms, both of which are pretty full of more oil barrels.  Everyone's really really careful: "No fire spells!  Look at all that oil! *shudder*.  Right.  They beat the ogres down and move forward: slowly, cuz the ogres are coming down from above, and there's a patrol that just got back and are entering the tower down below.<br/><br/>Third floor.  The priest and another guy are holding the rear in another room full of sand buckets.  The main group is fighting another force in a large room with two HUGE copper tanks in it.  The tanks are oil slicked on the outside.  There's empty oil barrels next to both of them, and copper pipeworks that lead up through the ceiling to the next floor.  The "figured it out" player nods to himself -- this is the main oil supply mechanism to the lights up above.   Right. The four of them fight carefully.<br/><br/>The priest (who was the leader) and the other guy in the back finish off the rear attack in the sand room with a flamestrike and some other stuff.<br/><br/>On the next round, the priest moves into the other room.  The player studiously looks over the room, examining the miniature placement.<br/><br/>"What are the big square things taking up all the space?"<br/>"Big copper tanks with pipes leading out of them up to the next floor."<br/>*nod* "Okay, I'm going to buy us some time to get a plan together." He grabs a red vis-a-vis and scribbles a jagged red line between the group and the advancing ogres (and touching both tanks).  "Wall of flame, right here."<br/><br/>This part kills me: everyone just nodded.<br/><br/>The tower went up like like Cape Canaveral.  The module actually mentioned how many gallons of oil both tanks contained, and how many 50 gallon drums there were -- the damage from it all going up at once would have been something like 250d6 or something, had we bothered rolling.  <br/><br/>My one and only TPK.<br/><br/>There were a few "save for half damage" jokes, and everyone packed up and headed out. They didn't even argue; I think they were too embarrassed. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I believe they painted up a wooden lighthouse with flames coming out the windows and carried it with them as a totem during the RPGA event, as a warning to themselves.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76206/#Comment_76206" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-17T08:39:27+00:00" title="June 17, 2007  8:39AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D campaign, mostly set around a city (though we occasionally ventured dungeonwards).  I rolled up a fighter, and got really solid stats across the board, and one 18 (which I could assign where I wanted).  I just didn't [i]feel like[/i] playing an optimaxed STR18 fighter, so I dumped it into charisma instead and reached for the splatbook with the swashbucklers.  Soon, I was playing an unrepentant fop, working the living heck out of the social setting of the city, and getting into duels of honor and all that great shit.  It was a gas.  People would spend all night memorizing spells and building components, and my guy (Arthur) would wander in come dawn, stinking drunk, missing half his clothes and covered with lipstick in intriguing patterns.<br/><br/>And then we encountered The Mirror.  Some wierd-ass high magick thingamazoo which was (for no apparent reason) just hanging out in a dungeon, waiting to trap people.  You walked down a corridor with this mirror, and as you walked your [i]image[/i] looked cooler and cooler (like, gained new equipment and abilities and all that jazz) while your actual character withered away and weakened (losing levels, that kinda stuff).<br/><br/>To this day, I don't know what the GM expected Arthur to do in response to that.  I'm guessing that he didn't think about it too hard.  The exchange went sorta like this:<br/><br/>Tony:  So ... I look more and more beautiful?<br/>GM:  Yes ... but you feel worse and worse.<br/>Tony:  But I <b>LOOK GOOD</b>.<br/>GM:  Yeah ... but you're dying.<br/>Tony:  That's just the price I'll have to pay.  What matters is that I look great!<br/><br/>And that's how Arthur died, walking forward to become an insanely pretty corpse.  He would have wanted it that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76220/#Comment_76220" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-17T10:33:51+00:00" title="June 17, 2007 10:33AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a 3rd level ranger that was scythed in half by a blade trap.

One character, playing the hard boiled detective named Steve Bradford, had missed some sessions. Naturally I decided his character was captured to be the sacrifice at the bad guys underground temple. The PCs charge in and stop the sacrifice only to find themselves in a stone chamber rapidly filling with water, attacked by hordes of killer rats, and accompanied by the comatose body of Steve Bardford.<br/><br/>So the characters stuff Steve into a stone coffin for safety. After they fight off the rats, they start trying to think of ways to get out. The mad scientist freezes a sheet of water in front of the door with his ice ray. "Now all we need is a battering ram!" They ended up attempting to batter down the door with the stone coffin containing the body of Steve Bradfor. The moral? Never miss a pulp session!<br/><br/>The player never did come back to the group, so Steve was left in a coma in some British run hospice in Zanzibar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BigJackBrass" title="BigJackBrass"><img alt="BigJackBrass" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/576/nNQFOT4MURTFT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BigJackBrass">BigJackBrass</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76232/#Comment_76232" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-17T12:22:53+00:00" title="June 17, 2007 12:22PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All too many years ago my <i>SpaceMaster</i> character was being held at gunpoint by a villain who wanted to hijack our ship.

The majority of the party was made up of fairy type characters while I made a holy inquisitor (don't ask me why, it was a long time ago).  Anyway, the game progressed and there was a bit of suspicion and tension between my character and the rest.  At one point, a group of us found ourselves in a boat rowing across the lake when the DM informs me that a sword just went through my head and I was dead.  Turns out the rest of the party conspired against me and murdered me.  From that day on, any time someone made a character that was diametrically opposed to the rest of the party we refered to him as a boat ride character.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) This second story is more a character suicide.  We were playing "My Life With Master".  My character was a playwrite whose "less than human" trait was that he could only speak in shakespearean quotes.  His "greater than human" trait was that be could write brilliant plays, but they must be written in the blood of the actors playing the roles.  At the end of the last session, he wrote a one man play staring himself.  This resulted in him bleeding to death.  He knew this would happen and devised a series of pullies, weights and ropes which he attached to himself in such a way that once he died his corpse would act out the play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76310/#Comment_76310" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-17T20:18:14+00:00" title="June 17, 2007  8:18PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mattgwinn</cite>He knew this would happen and devised a series of pullies, weights and ropes which he attached to himself in such a way that once he died his corpse would act out the play.</blockquote>AWESOME!

Homebrew D&amp;D; setting, with an evil elven empire ruling iron-fisted over the lesser races, drifting strangely into cyberpunk as our characters fled deeper and deeper into the underdark and found an army of rebel elves with magi-tech implants, flying tanks, and a plan to release an army of Beholders on the surface world to bring down in the dictatorship in a catastrophe of blood and fire.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy character, Gally, was the estranged daughter of the elven High Theocrat who had found Imperial propriety suffocating, <i>cropped the points off her own ears</i>, and run away to hang out with scummy lower-class humans. Through the whole story, her father's efforts to recapture her -- including a tactical mage-nuke blowing up an entire town she'd been hiding out in -- drove a great deal of the plot, but we never actually <i>saw</i> him or the high-falutin' palace circles she'd grown up in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the climactic session, my character convinced the party to reject both the rebel elves and the imperial elves for the heartless bastards they were and screw 'em both -- which, since I was getting my master's degree and heading back to the US in a few weeks, was my character's swan song. She was knocked out and captured.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: So where does Gally [my character] wake up? Does she wake up?<br/>\nAlden (the GM): When you come to, you're lying on a divan in a beautifully appointed room, with a balcony overlooking the capital city, far, far below. A refined male voice is saying, "Awake, my dear?"<br/>\nEveryone: Uh-oh.<br/>\nAlden: Remember when the rebel elves did surgery on you? You feel a strange lump in your belly, as if they left something behind....<br/>\nMe (smiling): Father?<br/>\nAlden: Yes?<br/>\nMe: <i>Come closer</i>.<br/>\nAlden: And then the bomb they left in your stomach explodes, taking out the entire palace....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76397/#Comment_76397" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T08:51:54+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  8:51AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2007 8:52AM by Andy.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>I am in a "noise rather than signal" mood today, and if Andy thinks this thread is too frivolous by all means shut it down!</blockquote>\nThese are the threads that bring me joy.
