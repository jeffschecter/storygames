Dresden does something like this (although I'm not sure what degree its player vs GM involvement) for city creation. Mortal Coil has a fantastic system that could be adapted to SotC, I think. But aside from those resources (one of which is unavailable being in playtest) I would advise coming up with either phases or questions that will help focus thought and promote creativity. Like, if the forces that be are important to build a metaphysical setting structure, well then just focus on some aspects that are about metaphysics for part of your world building. You setting might have 20 or 30 Aspects anyway. That's okay.<br/><br/>However, if I'm wrong and the gods/forces are critically important, could you elaborate on how they are important?<br/><br/>X-posted with Mike and then took tiem to read his link: The coolmap is one way to go about it. And might be a good way to start before you move to Aspects. If you have elves, that gives a basis for some aspects, like if you have the God of After-Dinner drinks instead of the God of Hangovers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155695/#Comment_155695" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-09T14:04:40+00:00" title="July  9, 2008  2:04PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2008 2:05PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fred Hicks ran a setting creation session for the campaign Faith, Faces, &amp; Fingerprints, and recorded it in "That's how we roll".

How could I forget? I was all gung-ho for Burning Campaigns a few months ago.  I like Blossoms' take on it, since it's more specific to "right now" instead of big picture questions.  The importance of "right now" is, of course, to have the fuel for story to happen as soon as you start playing. Play is just tossing the match. Although it does not do world creation (the world is made, it's Edo Japan) but modifying the Campaign Burner above to be less "what is the world" and more "what is the world as the PCs see it".  So, instead of asking "What is the world's culture?" I would ask "What cultures do your characters come from?"  If one person says "Like Ancient rome" and another says "Like the minbari from Babylon 5" then that doesn't mean there's not a pre-columbian Aztec culture. It just means it's not important right now. It also means that you want a discussion on how those two cultures get along and coexist (what's the common ground for ancient Rome and a alien sci-fi culture? What's the compromise to give the setting a coherent feel), and how that would lead to the characters knowing each other.  The way Blossoms works was that each answer gave some game element.  So here, each answer could give multiple setting Aspects and some will even give potential character Aspects.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155916/#Comment_155916" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T15:12:12+00:00" title="July 10, 2008  3:12PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lachlan, you're more than welcome, it's going to end up in a free system in any case - let me know how well it works or if there are any pitfalls.

In it, players build a new setting from the ground up, starting with geography and then moving to races and cultures in subsequent ages.  Each player is a god who can spend a limited pool of resources to shape the world to the benefit of his chosen people.
