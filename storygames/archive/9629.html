I think the "<i>Dogs</i> but only some people have guns" approach I took to the Tibet hack might work here too, or maybe something like <i>Shock:</i>, <i>Microscope</i>, or Emily's <i>A Day in the War</i> hack of <i>Zombie Cinema</i> that takes a look at a crisis from multiple different angles.  My purpose would be making a game that's both "fun" to play -- in the sense of providing both a narrative and mechanics that are engaging, not necessarily in that it's any happier than <i>Grey Ranks</i> or most sessions of <i>Dogs</i>  -- while also providing players with an opportunity to learn more about Iran, the current conflict, and the complexities of a struggle that is currently spiraling into more and more violence.<br/><br/>If some folks find the very idea of this distasteful, that's totally reasonable. Personally, I feel like attempting to put yourself in someone else's shoes and understand why people make the choices they do, whether it's standing up to armed security forces or firing on unarmed civilians, can only serve to make the world a better place.  But the decision to pursue that goal through the structure of roleplaying games is my choice and I'm not suggesting that anyone else make that choice unless they want to.<br/><br/>That said, how do we start?  Personally, for something like this to be really effective, I feel like it's important to include characters from very different walks of life, to show the diversity of perspectives at play.  So maybe we could start by listing a bunch of different character concepts and then figure out how to fit them into different games?  I'm totally fine with developing hacks for a number of different systems, if there's enough interest and people are pushing in different directions.<br/><br/>Some initial character concepts:<br/><br/>- a refugee from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, now finding themselves amidst a new civil conflict in Iran<br/>- a non-Muslim Jewish or Zoroastrian citizen, or maybe a Sunni such as a Kurd from the northeast of Iran<br/>- a foreign trained scientist (MIT?) working on Iran's nuclear program<br/>- one of the 400 women who finally joined the National Police Force in 2003<br/>- a member of VEVAK, the Iranian ministry of intelligence, or Basij, the volunteer paramilitary organization (like the National Guard or state militias)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

It'd be extraordinarily easy to do it <i>wrong</i>, basically.  "Playing" current events raises all sorts of issues (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuma%5CWar_2" rel="nofollow">Kuma/War</a>).<br/><br/>One thing that I think would be important is that the game provide the tools for understanding the context of what you are playing, so that it is a learning tool.<br/><br/>I think Zombie Cinema/A Day in the War is a good place to start.  I'd also look at Ron's game-in-development, Shahida, which touches on current events (or can).  My gut feeling is that playing extraordinary people (like those on your list) isn't the best approach - I think I'd make the playable character set very ordinary Iranians, with departures from a mundane baseline just far enough to illustrate the diversity of circumstance within, say, a particular neighborhood in Tehran.  I might take a hard look at what "playable" means, and drift away from character monogamy toward some sort of ensemble thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213736/#Comment_213736" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T12:25:32+00:00" title="June 21, 2009 12:25PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, what makes one Iranian ordinary and another extraordinary?

I definitely think playing Emily's <i>A Day in the War</i> hack was valuable, even though there were a number of things potentially "wrong" with the game at that point, including some aspects that lead at least one player to walk away from the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JAR" title="JAR"><img alt="JAR" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JAR">JAR</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213744/#Comment_213744" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T13:35:04+00:00" title="June 21, 2009  1:35PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Minor niggling note, you mean Kurd from the northwest of Iran, not the northeast. <br/>\n<br/>\nMore substantively, I think what he means by extraordinary v. ordinary is more representative of the statistical composite of the mean Iranian, as it were (a soldier drafted from a rural area near Merv, an unemployed textile worker in Isfahan, a housewife in Tabriz)  versus more distant from the statistical composite along some very notable dimension (being from a small religious/ethnic minority, a foreigner/professional smartypants, an intelligence agent). I think of the examples you gave, a member of the Basij might be closer to Jason's idea of "ordinary," bearing in mind that they are expected to represent and believe in a particularly strong version of the prevailing ideology of the Islamic Republic, so a bit like playing a blackshirt in Mussolini's Italy. Obviously, Jason, if I'm totally missing your point, do let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sort of more sympathetic to this idea; I think that what is happening now is much more interesting when viewed from the perspective of someone who was until recently very much inside of the system, rather than someone who is largely an outsider. Outsiders, I feel, can more readily imagine how circumstances might be very different from what they are, or at least, not necessarily fear a major upheaval (since they're not in positions of privilege as is), whereas someone closer to the composite of someone within the system has a much more fraught set of feelings on average about what might happen, pro-Ahmadi or anti-Ahmadi.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213747/#Comment_213747" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T13:46:38+00:00" title="June 21, 2009  1:46PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2009 1:47PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Jason, what makes one Iranian ordinary and another extraordinary?</blockquote>\nI'd suggest that focusing on the extraordinary (which Joshua Riley pretty much nails; I use the word literally) is less likely to lead to empathy, to understanding, to personal investment.  It's more likely to lead to action and excitement and conflict as lots of very different people are thrown together as though it were a Raymond Carver novel or something, which is great for a roleplaying game.  Roleplaying seems like only a piece of this idea, though, a means to an end.<br/><br/>You may be totally right about paralysis.  I approach these things with reverence, since I might have to look someone in the eye who has lived it (in this case<i> is living it</i>).  There's a point of successful balance you can find, and maybe that varies from person to person, and maybe getting it wrong is inevitable to some degree because of that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213752/#Comment_213752" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T14:16:32+00:00" title="June 21, 2009  2:16PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua, I was going by this map, which indicates there are Kurds in both the northeast and northwest.

Honestly, I didn't mention them in my original post partially because they're the first people that come to mind and I wanted to make sure to remember that they don't necessarily represent the diversity of interests that exists.  But you're right that it's important to show people who are invested in the status quo or are interested in making less radical changes that don't threaten their own livelihood.  I was also thinking, <i>Shock:</i> style, that it might be interesting to show characters who are at the crossroads of different interests, such as female police officers.<br/><br/>On the reverence issue, Jason, I guess I feel that a one-shot roleplaying session (or even a few sessions), inherently ephemeral and experienced solely by the people involved, is less likely to deeply wound folks directly involved in the actual events than a movie or novel or article on the same subject, which potentially stands for all eternity and it publicly available.  If I was going to publish a game about something like this, as you did with <i>Grey Ranks</i>, I would definitely do a lot more research and talk to a bunch of people, but I worry that moving cautiously on something like this risks loosing the immediacy.  Sure, we could play my Tibet game today (and indeed, I wasn't actually able to play it last spring), now that the outcome of that conflict is known (at least for now), but it wouldn't really be the same, yeah?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213780/#Comment_213780" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T19:26:13+00:00" title="June 21, 2009  7:26PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, <br/><br/>I find this topic deeply difficult to talk about, so if I become an ass in any way, please call me on it. <br/><br/>I want to ask why the immediacy is important to you. Like, when you say, "I worry that moving cautiously on something like this risks loosing the immediacy" what is it, exactly, that you're looking for with that? Is it understanding of the situation, or is it a feeling of connection with the situation?
