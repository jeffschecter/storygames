                    Heya,<br/>
<br/>
I think some people have brought this up before.  But I'll provide the link that was released today: http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23368492-details/Sony's+electronic+book+hails+new+dawn+for+reading/article.do<br/>
<br/>
Anyone think this will affect RPGs in the future?<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

                            It believe it surely will, but I also believe thier will always be a place for actual paper books. For one, it's just so much easier flipping back and forth between actual pages, than screens. For two, at least this iteration has no (to my knowledge) ability to display graphics, just text.<br/><br/>When a device like this comes out that can mimic the look of a color plated page, with art and tables...then it might time to pulp books.                        </div>

                            Exciting. Sony's was just one of three readers in development, which will all come out at about the same time, all in the $300-$400 initial release range.<br/><br/>Reader vs PS3, PS3 wins.  Still, if they come down in price, I might seriously consider it. I have a lot of PDF materials that I'd love to read in bed.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            No, not yet, but only because it's still a little bit of a stumbling step, and it currently has less functionality than the last time the e-book hit the marketplace  and raised all the same questions (which would be back around 2000).<br/><br/>Which is not to say I don't have the love.  My rocket e-book (Same kind of device, except thicker, and with less battery life due to an LCD screen) has served me well in numerous games, and I think the potential is limitless.  However, at the current price point and functionality, it's a brick.  The Irex Iliad, a competing device, actually has the functionality, but it costs more than twice as much.<br/><br/>The big problem is that e-books are perpetually one of those ideas that are conceptually awesome but that no one has come out with a good business model for. Worse, a lot of the folks who would have been early adopters (both as purchasers and content providers) got burned pretty bad when the whole thing went down the toilet a few years back.  Now, I'm optimistic that this will eventually rock - e-paper is a technology I've been panting after since I first read about it, god, like 10 years ago and it's awesome to see it become a reality.  What's more, I think that devices like this have a _lot_ to offer, not just to gaming and novel reading, but in all manner of information management.  In pure device size, the market has yet to really put together the device that is bigger than a palm, but simple to use and reasonably priced.  The new generation of ultra mobile PCs which have this kind of form factor, are terrible, and other mini-tablet ideas (like the nokia 770) get cannibalized by needs of cell phone users.<br/><br/>And ultimately, that may be the thing that crushes my optimism.  The form factor is very appealing only when compared to carrying around a book.  Compared to your cell phone or ipod, it's ridiculous.  Now, there are some other promising advances that may address this, like roll-up or fold-up screens which take advantage of some of the physical properties of e-paper, and may allow for a more easily portable device that still has a comfortably readable screen.<br/><br/>Anyway, if it's not obvious, I'm a huge nerd for these things, and I'm really glad the Sony reader has hit American markets if only because it should really get the ball rolling on a market I _want_ to see grow.<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>PS - And I've told myself I -won't- buy one of the Sony's.  To much money, too many features missing.  I do not actually trust myself to keep this up, though.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>Umm... is there some reason this is going to affect RPGs in particular? If we don't see a lot of laptops at gaming tables (yet), why would we see a lot of these?</blockquote>
Well,let me speak to my use of the Rocket-book, a similar device.<br/><br/>With a form factor similar to a book, I can hold it in one hand, turn pages with my thumb, and generally speaking use it as a reference for my game notes _more_ efficiently than I could with paper.  What's more, because it was electronic, I could take advantage of the medium to cheat a little.  As an example, I was running Exalted, so I ran a random number generator and literally filled the left hand margin with d10 rolls.  I had a little stylus so I could cross stuff off or highlight it, and it let me walk and talk as I GM'd, just marking off the numbers rather than physically rolling dice.  Could I have done the same thing with a clipboard and some printouts?  absolutely - in fact, the number thing was something I used to do on paper.  But combined with the ease of flipping through my notes without a mess, it was pretty powerfully awesome.  And I was directly engaged with my players - unlike with a laptop, this was in my hand, not between me and them.  The same thing might be doable with a Palm or similar device, but I've never successfully done so, mostly due to size limits.<br/><br/>Now, that was purely my notes.  Imagine, if you would, if I'd had the (searchable) pdfs of the rules in the same device? Quick search on a charm or rule, and everything goes more easily than a physical lookup might be, and I didn't need to haul my whole collection to the game, something which, with a game like exalted, is a pretty big deal.<br/><br/>An offshoot of that is that if I have a device like this, I will be _much_ more willing to buy pdfs because I have a comfortable, easy way to read them without the necessity of printing and binding.  Pdf publishing is its own thing, but it's cheaper and generally more profitable for publishers, so the possibility that the barrier for publishing get even _lower_ than it is now is intriguing in the extreme. <br/><br/>Now, the new Sony can't do this yet.  It's a pure reader, so it's mostly useful for carrying more books in less space, but it's still a potential publishing platform, and it's (I hope) just the first step.  But the bottom line is, both as a tool for play and an avenue of productions, there are lots of potential application to RPGs, some of which I suspect haven't even been thought of yet. <br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

The article states:
<blockquote>Like paper, the display is readable from any angle, but it doesn't look as good as the real thing, chiefly because the contrast doesn't compare well. The background isn't white and the letters aren't black. The letters show some jaggedness, even though the resolution is a very respectable 800 by 600 pixels. <i>It will display photos, though they look a bit like black-and-white photocopies.</i></blockquote>
I imagine flipping through a book would be as simple as scrolling through a playlist. Pretty cool, actually.                        </div>

                            Daniel,<br/><br/>Yeah, what I was imaginging is something like D&amp;D's PHB (or other graphically intense rpgs) that has background images with text, tables, or even other images on top. Unless the .pdf being used with the reader is totally black &amp; white, I can see some legibility issues; which may not be an issue anyway since a lot .pdfs being released offers a 'printer friendly' version in B &amp; W.                        </div>

                            A stylus driven e-ink character sheet would be the awesomest, especially for stat-heavy games like D&amp;D. You just gained a weapon? Tap the weapon box, and pick a new one from a list, or create a new one from a form. All the stats update automagically. Now you're under the influence of a spell? Pick "Spell Effect", pick the spell from the list, and watch all my pertinent stats change for the duration of the spell.<br/><br/>If I were playing Sorcerer, as GM, I could keep my relationship map on a giant, scrolling page and update it on the fly, scribbling notes here and there. Select one of the names on the map and pull up NPC details, or write new ones. And having the book text to cross-reference for rules, demon powers, etc.                        </div>

                            Okay, I'm going to rave about <i>the technology</i>.  Why?  Because I've been keeping my eye on <i>this particular technology</i> since its inception, and I am utterly, completely thrilled to see it getting a widespread commercial application.<br/><br/>Each pixel of this is a microcapsule filled with white fluid, and possessing a tiny, magnetic, black ball.  Each of these capsules is surrounded by little magnets.  The magnets can be individually controlled, causing the ball to either float to the surface or sink to the bottom.  Power consumption is very, very, <b>very</b> low by comparison with light emitting media.  I could be wrong, but I think that power consumption when the text is static (i.e. the spheres are just locked in position) is literally <b>zero</b>.  The battery drain of the display occurs only when updating the content.  The Sony site lists battery life in page-flips.  Seventy-five HUNDRED page-flips.<br/><br/>The Sony unit has the paper behind glass.  The paper does not need to be behind glass (although I'm sure that it will increase the lifetime of the page).  The material is flexible ... comparable with paper, in fact, as a material.<br/><br/>The Sony unit charges ~$400 for a display unit that uses a single page.  Long term, this display is <b>not</b> anything like that kind of expensive.  It doesn't have to be assembled by sub-micron laser etchers.  The folks at MIT designed the process specifically so that, with enough investment and work, the pages can be driven down to be <b>comparable to the cost of paper</b>.  The economy of scale goes down to pennies a page.<br/><br/>Likewise, contrast, color and density of pixels are all factors that scale down as the process refines.  Color is easy, if you want it ... just put little magnetic red, green and blue spheres into the capsules instead.<br/><br/>So ... the Sony unit?  As a product?  Eh.  But damn am I glad that they're supporting the technology, and I sure as heck hope it takes off.  Because I would really, really like the product this paper is designed for ... a virtual book, with say a hundred pages of two-sided e-ink paper, the electronics and battery in a light-weight spine, and the controls on the inside of the cover.  You'd read that one just like a normal book ... select "Writers &gt; Asimov, Isaac &gt; Foundation Trilogy", riffle through the book and you can see all the pages at once.<br/><br/>Oh how I want this technology.                        </div>

                            In 5 to 10 years, this technology WILL change publishing. The current generation won't, but when it evolves to a sub-pound tablet with 600 dpi color resolution and a decent screen refresh rate for around $100, it will. (One of my computer-nerd friends is convinced that this technology will replace computer monitors and TVs as well).                        </div>

                            Tony, I remember reading an article about E-ink in one of those thin "kids' science" magazines back when I was just 11-years-old and anticipating its widespread usage ever since.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Likewise, contrast, color and density of pixels are all factors that scale down as the process refines.  Color is easy, if you want it ... just put little magnetic red, green and blue spheres into the capsules instead.</blockquote>
Because this is not a projected-light medium, would the pigments be Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black like regular printing ink? I just recently read an article on a fabric that behaves like chromatophores seen in the skin of chameleons and octopi. Like electronic ink, it's not a projected light medium, the surface texture adjusts to electric stimulus. This produces color as accurate as any painting, garment, plant or anything else that has actual pigment in it. Crazy stuff.                        </div>

I can only hope so eventually, though the only one color one I've seen any real data on (Fujitsu) uses Red,Green and Blue layers.  That said, this stuff is getting cooler every month, so watch this space.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            You know, I don't see the point in having more than one page. You can only read one page at a time, anyway. What would you gain with multiple pages (like a real book) that you can't duplicate with electronic bookmarks or whatnot? Having one single page would be cheaper, too.                        </div>

                            Tim:  The point is that, if/when the paper gets down to 10 cents a page, it is actually -cheaper- to make a book with a hundred pages than to install controls to flip pages.  The pages are the user interface.                        </div>

<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,71844-0.html?tw=rss.index" rel="nofollow">Wired has further reviews of the device</a><br/><br/>RE: Page-flipping
<blockquote>[I] found page-flipping no more (or less) sleep-inducing with the Reader than with any paper business book.</blockquote>
RE: Artwork
<blockquote>...Peach Fuzz, was fun to read on the device. Though the Reader displays only four levels of gray, graphic novels and other graphically complex images appear crisply on screen, though there is a slightly longer delay for the device to paint the display.</blockquote>
RE: Interface
<blockquote>The Reader's interface, with its five-way main control (a four-way Menu ring and an Enter button), 10 buttons for accessing list selections, and two sets of page-turning buttons, works adequately with the device's software for basic file navigation and selection. With a button press, you can easily rotate the screen horizontally for a different point of view.</blockquote>
And another interesting feature:
<blockquote>The Reader also plays MP3 files. They can be listened to through a headset (not provided with the device). I listened to a couple of sample MP3s through my Logitech headset, and the sound was clean, and cleaner yet when I hooked it up to an inexpensive, three-way Altec Lansing computer-speaker system. Though it might be an example of "feature creep" in a product Sony has positioned to be a consumer reading device, it was nice to be able to listen to some soft background music while reading a book, though the bare-bones audio interface is no iTunes.</blockquote> </div>

                            Ok, I just grabbed my stack of d20 stuff, then my stack of minitaure books, and the a stack of the indie rpgs that I own....... each stack is more cumbersome than my laptop. I don't really think there is an arguement as far as form factor goes Laptops vs stack of books. So why have laptops not become the norm at rpg tables?  With an internet connection I have almost anything I want available to me right at the gaming table. It doesn't need to fit in my back pocket or fit the form factor of a book reader.... these devices don't excited me much, my laptop has SO much more to offer me already. my 2c                        </div>

                            Actually, laptops are pretty common in my gaming group.  The house we play at has a wireless connection, so it isn't uncommon to see 6 or 8 laptops around the gaming table.<br/><br/>Still, even with a laptop, I'm interested in this.  If it's small enough to fit in a coat pocket, then it's perfect.                        </div>

                            I think the electronic paperback isn't exciting for RPG's, it's exciting for novels.                        </div>

<p>It's certainly exciting for novels. I just recently downloaded all the Tom Corbett Space Cadet novels from Project Gutenberg, as research for a '40s/'50s-style classic rocket SF/space patrol game. Since my laptop blew up, I'm stuck reading them on my desktop computer, which means I can only read in one specific location and position. I can't take them with me and read over lunch, I can't read them in bed. A low-cost electronic reader about the same size and weight as a paperback book would be great, especially if the screen is more readable than an LCD.</p>
<p>Will it have an effect on RPGs? I think that's looking at it the wrong way around. The question we should be asking is: how could RPG designers use the spread of electronic readers to their advantage, assuming they do spread? One change could be that designers could use more "look-up table"-oriented designs. Not a look-up table for every step of play, of course, but maybe a specially-designed set of linked look-up tables that cause situation changes at specific moments of play; sort of like random encounter tables, but arranged in an escalating list, with play moving to the next encounter table in the chain whenever a special condition occurrs.</p>

                            I read all of Corey Doctorow's novels on my Treo 600/650 smartphone last year.  It was fine for reading the novels since they are published in a whole bunch of formats including HTML.  It worked less well for PDFs.  I read Dog In The Vineyard off it when I got the PDF.  The Palm PDF reader is, at best, utilitarian.  But I read the book that way.<br/>
<br/>
I've been reading Agon from my new phone, a Nokia e61.  The PDF reader is a bit more functional and the screen is bigger. (also it works better as a phone than the Treo, because people you're talking to can actually hear what you're saying.  Which I consider a boon for a phone)<br/>
<br/>
I also have a Windows Mobile PDA that I use for GPS applications.  It also runs a PDF viewer.  I've used it to read a number of books, including Burning Empires.  It's the daddy of all the devices I've used in terms of portable PDF reading.  Cost about Â£200 6 months ago, I'm sure you can get cheaper devices if you don't want the GPS function.  The screen is about 3.5" I guess.  Setting the PDF viewer to show the width of the page in landscape with the column of text stretching the width of the screen was comfortable to read.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I was given a Tablet PC to test by some guys at HP.  It way really nice to read PDFs on because the screen allowed for a full A4/Letter page to be displayed at once.  The model I was given was way too heavy though, but that's because it was a convertible rather than a proper tablet PC.<br/>
<br/>
I think that the way ahead (for gamers) is a device running an existing OS.  Palm or Windows Mobile, possibly XP Tablet. That way you immediately hook into a whole bunch of ready made apps you can run (like Die Rollers, PDF viewers and whatever software you might want, like Metacreator or whatever).  The best device I can think of for that kind of thng right now would be a small and light Tablet PC.  But those are far from cheap.                        </div>

                            The RPG-based utility of it is more useful to me for mainstream games than for most small press ones.  For games like D&amp;D, Exalted or NWOD, where running a game means hauling a fat stack of books around just because I might need one or two things from each, having them all in a reader (and hopefully well bookmarked) would be a godsend.  In contrast, if I want to run Polaris or DitV or Truth and Justice, we're talking about one book and one book only, and while it'd be kind of _neat_ to have them all in one device, there's no pressing _need_.<br><br>I'm biased though. I've already gotten great use out of devices like this for my Exalted and Seventh Sea games.  Things like this (Or like a tablet that I can justify the cost to fragility ratio for) definately excite me.<br><br>-Rob D.                        </br></br></br></br></div>
