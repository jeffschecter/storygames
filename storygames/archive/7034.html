I heard from a few people who want a copy but who won't be able to get to Gen Con. There's an extremely small chance that I'll sell out of copies, so I wanted to set aside copies for those of you who were really excited about the game and won't get to get a copy there. If you want, Paypal me $12 (the cover price + $2 shipping)* at my gmail address, which is at rob dot bohl before I leave for Gen Con (by August 11 at 12 pm Eastern). In the paypal email, include your address. I'll respond to each email I get as soon as possible. Then I'll set aside a copy for you when I get them and mail it as soon as I can.<br/><br/>If you're coming to Gen Con, I'd rather sell it to you there. I don't want to do a huge pre-order thing, I just want to ensure that the people who are enthusiastic about the game aren't going to get screwed because they didn't go to Gen Con.<br/><br/>* Note: If you're not in the continental US, email me at that same address and we'll work out what the cost of shipping will be. I'll just be charging shipping at cost.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161061/#Comment_161061" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-06T17:08:04+00:00" title="August  6, 2008  5:08PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey folks,<br/><br/>I got the books.
