Then they realize they can't keep compounding the lie, but they try to fix things in a shady way (Q3), without admitting they lied*.  Inevitably this fails, and they come clean (Q4).<br/><br/>Nice simple model; I dig it.<br/><br/>*At least not to the person they lied to.  Often they confess to a third party and try to rope that person into helping.

So if you take "lawful" to mean "follows the rules of society" and "chaotic" to mean "doesn't follow rules," rather than "principled" and "unprincipled," respectively, then that's fine. But does that mean that in practice you wouldn't call Varys "chaotic good," Sandor "lawful evil," Ramsay "chaotic evil," and Jon Snew "lawful good"? <br/><br/>My observation was more intended to be amusing than insightful, I'll admit, but you should definitely take another look at alignment in light of this comment:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If there was another two categories that represented the middle-ground between \u201cGood-Evil\u201d and \u201cHonest-Dishonest\u201d it would pretty much cover everyone.</p></div></blockquote>\nYou can't mean "Neutral," can you? ;-)<br/><br/>Also, I get what Dave is saying: the quadrants aren't permanent characterizations or fixed attitudes of characters; instead, they're responses to situational prompts that drive further action and hopefully different choices.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472835/#Comment_472835" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-24T20:31:54+00:00" title="April 24, 2018  8:31PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps Nathan will correct me, but I believe these four quadrants represent steps in an arc, not character types.<br/><br/>If Jon Snow spends every minute of every day being Lawful Good or Good Honest, that's not much of an arc.  Fortunately, he breaks some Night's Watch vows, kills a friend, lies to the Wildlings and double-crosses them, claims he can't honestly represent the North if he kneels but then kneels anyway, and on and on.  Conscience and duty are in frequent conflict, and he certainly doesn't stay good, lawful, or honest by both standards at all times.  (Of course, it's still easy to call him Lawful Good overall, because everyone else in Westeros is so much worse.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472837/#Comment_472837" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-24T20:36:52+00:00" title="April 24, 2018  8:36PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you're probably right, Dave.

For a very important reason, the protagonist takes action.  At some point they have to lean into this shit, and show the audience who they are.  They don't need the plot shoving it in their face, but yeah, that helps too, but people like to see people do things that define them.  <br/><br/>This shit gets worse.  It kinda shows how bad things would get if no one did anything.  This lie is really tearing things apart.  "You're tearing me apart, Lisa!"<br/><br/>The protagonist then gets surprised at the crazy place this new direction in life has taken them.  It's really terrible, and scary, but also eye-opening.  The truth hurts, and you're beginning to see it.  Aww, my eyes!  <br/><br/>All this truth has changed you.  You're not the same person you were at the start of this, or if you are, you perspective on this particular has changed.  Something has changed, and for the better.  You're at peace with this, this new way of seeing the world and a part of yourself.  <br/><br/>Not all storytelling fits this mold, but much does.  <br/><br/>I mean, Norm is Norm at the start of every episode of Cheers, but on occasion he is tempted by some bullshit scheme, goes through some shit, reluctantly has a change of heart, and becomes a happier, better two-dimensional character.  <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
