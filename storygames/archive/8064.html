Industrial area docks<br/><br/>This place is filled with cranes to swing in or use to grab your opponent, crates to throw at people, or throw people at, and trucks to run people over with. It's always bustling with activity, even at night, as the wheels of commerce never stop turning. Huge ships are always docked outside, and the cargo often presents opportunities for the creative fighter. An unloading of gallons of fuel can create massive explosions, and it's not uncommon to find shady weapons smugglers unloading heavy firepower disguised in easily breakable crates (but guarded by heavily armed thugs). Also, some of the cranes use powerful electromagnets. And cargo is often piled high, so that a forceful enough push (say, from a weight swinging in a crane) can topple it unto an unsuspecting opponent.<br/><br/>(I'm loving this thread)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177975/#Comment_177975" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-10T07:45:18+00:00" title="November 10, 2008  7:45AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            29.

Bogg Hill<br/><br/>Bogg Hill is an old, or even ancient neighborhood of three and four story tall brick apartment buildings (often with stores or taverns in their ground floors or basements), narrow, sharply-sloped cobblestone streets and haphazardly strung electrical wires.  Bogg Hill (so named as it was once a hilly island rising from the Great Gasford Swamp) is connected to the rest of the city by only by the narrow, treacherous Bogg Street that passes between the wilds of Gasford County Park and forbidding walls of Senator Pallmire's Garden.

If in a fight, a local is hurt or property is damaged, the folk of Bogg Hill, armed with kitchen knives, stout oak sticks and hastily pried-up cobblestones, will boil out like bees from a disturbed hive to defend their neighborhood, attacking all sides regardless of who caused the harm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178182/#Comment_178182" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-11T10:52:13+00:00" title="November 11, 2008 10:52AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Refresh the top image to see labels, I've done all of them through to Bogg Hill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178196/#Comment_178196" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-11T12:31:46+00:00" title="November 11, 2008 12:31PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            34.

The crime rate was off the scales, and even the police hesitated to patrol the area. The current mayor built his election victory on promising to "rid the city of that cesspool Valley Creek". Apart from the merely cosmetic renaming of the area to Sunside Valley, he is evacuating the entire area. Anyone who can produce documents proving they own property in the area can sell it for good money (well, more than it's worth, anyway). All population is to be moved to other places, and the entire district will be demolished to make room for a luxury community. As a result, a third of the area is a construction site of luxury apartments, a third is a demolition zone, full of huge machines capable of wreaking havoc on the old buildings of Valley Creek, and the final third is still battered old run-down houses, about to fall apart and inhabited by squatters and criminals. At night, and sometimes during the day, the demolition machines are attacked with explosives, firearms, baseball bats and all sorts of creative, home-made weapons that can sometimes be found lying around even during the daytime.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179113/#Comment_179113" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T08:31:56+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  8:31AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            22. The Steamworks<br/><br/>At the turn of the century, this huge industrial complex was the bleeding edge of technology and modernity.  Now it is half abandoned, and the remainder is only in use due to the availability of dirt cheap labor from the neighboring slums, the city's disinterest in enforcing any form of labor protection or job safety laws, and because it was built to last.<br/><br/>At the center is a huge, central steam plant.  It is hot as the hinges of hell, and surrounded by mountains of loose coal.  The air around the plant is full of smoke and sparks, and visibility is very limited.  The workers, wearing kerchiefs across their mouths and stripped to waist, wield black iron shovels that make excellent melee weapons in a pinch.<br/><br/>Steam pipes, large enough for a man to crawl through, go everywhere, both under and over the ground.  Some are always full of superheated steam, some are never and used, and some are used only some of the time. <br/><br/>Surrounding the steam plant are various factories full of huge gears and steam-driven machinery.  Some are long abandoned, full of rats and broken glass and rust, some have been carefully boarded up for future use, and some are still in use.  The latter are the most dangerous, as steam and unprotected moving parts are everywhere.  The roofs are mostly wrought iron frameworks holding glass panels to let in the light, but many are panels missing or replaced by plywood.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179118/#Comment_179118" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T09:04:21+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  9:04AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2008 9:05AM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            8) Bruno's Ski World<br/><br/>On the very edge of the city -- where the first dump was located 150 years ago stands a testament to market-driven land-use reform.  In only twenty years, "Uncle" Bruno Vergerhofenskiwrldn transformed the rat- and chemical-infested mountains of concrete chunks, smoldering mattresses and ancient bullet-pocked refrigerators into the city's greatest entertainment asset.<br/><br/>From 10 AM to 1 AM every day of the year, people can be found skiing, snow-boarding and tubing down the multitude of slopes available at BSW.  A common fun-for-the-whole-family scenario includes medicated three-year olds tubing in classes on the bunny slope while their mothers watch hunky olympic ski-jumpers practice and their fathers drink at the Barcade(tm) and drool over busty teen-age attendants.<br/><br/>At 1 AM the slopes close, the lights go out, the network of three dozen ski-lift-lines slide to a halt and the snow machines kick on.  One million cubic feet of snow are generated every night for Bruno's operation -- much of it shooting through the air for hundreds of feet for precise placement on the slopes.<br/><br/>Fighting at BSW during the day has an incredible array of moving obstacles, both on the ground and through the air, but worse -- Bruno has been known to get testy when the fighting disrupts his smoothly oiled revenue machine.  At night, unpredictable and massive jets of ice crystals can make the fight tricky, but come morning, all signs of your activity will be hidden by a pristine coat of snow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179120/#Comment_179120" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T09:09:27+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  9:09AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

The building is 20 stories tall, and painted to look like it's built of legos, 1 brick tall per story.<br/><br/>Inside you can hear faint mooing, and the buzz of chainsaws.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180673/#Comment_180673" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-28T14:07:08+00:00" title="November 28, 2008  2:07PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            16 - The Mausoleum of Darker Arts<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce a great burial place for the great families who founded the city, it nows sits deep below the subway lines above it, gathering energies from the riders above.  Decades ago, a cult found this place once more and uses it to sanctify ancient rites to dark Gods.  You got here just in time to stop the latest ritual!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy this place is cool for a fight - Lots of old, soggy, moldy rugs and tapestries to pull down on people or set fire to.  The pace is off center after the Great Quake and water has risen up to cover some of the lower levels and part of the floor here in the Rotunda.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the subway trains pass over, all sorts of noise vibrations shake the place, and a sickly green smoke falls into the center of the pentacle in the room (is this the soul-essence of the riders?)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Cults use a variety of occult paraphernalia, including a huge altar, a golden pentacle, and deep red and black robes.  Candles burn in ancient fireboxes from long ago.  Shadows dance here.  All of these can give the right person an edge in a fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nLest we not forget, the honored dead of this city's founding surround us.  What if they rose up to join either side (to aid the necromancers who abuse their former lives or the heroes who come to set things right at last)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
