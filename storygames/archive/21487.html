You get slower progression for a stronger class to make up for the class having better features. I don't remember ever hearing a direct reason from Gygax, except in AD&amp;D DMG (which should, I think, be considered largely a posteori reasoning, considering the distance in time from the original creation).<br/><br/>Note that the classes do not progress at different rates after the very beginning. Rather, some drag slightly behind others. Different rate of progression would be if one class advanced a level for every 1.25 levels another progresses, or something like that, but what you actually get is that each class is a certain constant percentage of a level ahead or beyond each other class, given equal XP gain. For example, Fighters are 0.25 levels ahead of a Magic-User, by which I mean that 25% of the time the Fighter with equal XP is one level ahead, and 75% of the time they are even.<br/><br/>(To find out the "drag rate" for a pair of classes, take the ratio of their 2nd level xp limits by dividing the larger number with the smaller one, resulting in a fraction larger than 1. The fraction tells you how often during a given level span of XP growth the faster class is ahead of the slower class. If the drag rate is over 2, that means that the classes are always one or more levels apart, which is the case if you compare the cheapest classes like Thief with the more expensive classes like Magic-User.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470103/#Comment_470103" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-20T12:57:54+00:00" title="February 20, 2018 12:57PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2018 1:00PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for why one would want to use the conceit today, I think it works nicely as part of the feel of a class. It's a largely arbitrary mechanical idea that you can set any which way to mess with players and give the campaign an unique feel. It helps players feel that their class choice is justified, as the advancement drag is such a perpendicular issue compared to hit dice or hit bonuses or other class features, not very easily linearized into a cut and dry analysis. It's something to think about when class feature envy raises its ugly head, so to speak [grin].<br/><br/>Another advantage is that it codifies and directly causes characters to advance at different times, which trains the players to accept and appreciate the fact that the game doesn't have fair and even advancement, particularly the more sandboxy character stable wargame campaigns where level discrepancies can grow rather large even regardless of the advancement drag. So there's a pedagogical function for those of us who want to train the players out of lock-step thinking where everybody gets the same XP all the time.<br/><br/>The advantage of dropping the class-specific advancement rate, on the other hand, is mainly a slight decrease in the complexity of a class write-up. I personally don't really use the table-based representation of xp limits (it's just "geometric series with starting point in this number" if anybody asks), so I don't feel the pressure, but I can see how somebody might feel differently.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470106/#Comment_470106" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-20T14:34:54+00:00" title="February 20, 2018  2:34PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2018 2:35PM by Johann.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Another advantage is that it codifies and directly causes characters to advance at different times, which trains the players to accept and appreciate the fact that the game doesn't have fair and even advancement, particularly the more sandboxy character stable wargame campaigns where level discrepancies can grow rather large even regardless of the advancement drag.

(I do the same softening myself by enabling stats to change through gameplay, so you can "fix" the character's stat line with time and effort.) I would probably justify it to players by telling them that there are structural constraints to becoming an adventurer, and the less talented somebody is, the more tenacious they obviously have to be to qualify - and therefore the more talent you have, the more you can afford to coast through life. Untalented characters have had to work harder to earn their PC-hood, and this shows in their starting XP score [grin].<br/><br/>You could even ask every player to tell others where their character gained their starting XP. The characters who have more to start with have obviously undergone particularly arduous experiences to come to where they are now. "Well yeah, I suppose killing one dragon would be enough for somebody as smart as you are. I had to kill three before I earned my spurs." Intuitive enough for me.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I'd be very hesitant to ruin my XP calculations by giving out free and unearned XP. For this reason I'd rather implement the bonus in some way that doesn't affect the actual numeric XP score. This is strictly a personal aesthetic issue, though, and just adding the points directly is probably the simplest and most elegant way to go about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470111/#Comment_470111" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-20T17:26:50+00:00" title="February 20, 2018  5:26PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always liked looking at the variable rate of advancement as a sort of "difficulty" gauge for the game.<br/><br/>"Here, you can have this class, which will be hard to play, but you stand to advance more quickly."<br/><br/>"Or you can start with this class, which has many more benefits at the beginning, so the game will be easier for you at first.

I've heard a couple of stories over the years that involve party betrayals and the like, but they're usually isolated incidents and don't generally explain the larger contexts of play, what happened to the character or the game as a whole afterwards: if they got away with it, if it affected their reputation, if the player could even get away with playing the character again, etc.<br/><br/>Or maybe I'm thinking too hard about extreme cases, and the rivalry/competition is something more subtle? I've always had the distinct impression that party unity was less of a sacred cow, particularly before the "GM-plot" style of game became more common, but I have a hard time picturing what this difference might have looked like in more practical terms, besides lawful and chaotic characters adventuring together because it's not like looting old ruins is a particularly alignment-restricted activity.<br/><br/>Edit: Come to think of it, when I first started playing AD&amp;D in the '90s, the people I played with were rather unrelenting in pursuit of individual experience awards (I feel like at times we even tracked individual monster kills, so if you solo'ed something you wouldn't have to split the XP) and friendly inter-player ribbing about each other's characters and their in-game accomplishments and failures, and we took a fairly anything-goes approach to chargen and the like. Though that was more a metagaming-heavy player rivalry than a character one.

As a famous example: if you're a vampire, the clerics willing to put you down might not be too far behind. They're other player characters, yes, but it's not like you're in a party with them!<br/><b>*</b> Becoming a high-level character means becoming a feudal lord. Struggle for power is a fact of life between lords in the wargamey fictional context that D&amp;D imagines - of course you might even fight a war with a former comrade, particularly if they've fallen under the sway of the wrong religion or something like that.<br/><br/>So the game turning competitive rather than cooperative is more of a high-level idea than a low-level one. As I often tell the players, the game is difficult enough at low levels <i>without</i> the players making it more difficult for themselves by infighting. Get to name level first and then I can totally see how your ennui and self-confidence will lead to former comrades coming to blows. After all, who else could truly challenge such a hero - or stop him...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470118/#Comment_470118" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-20T19:19:35+00:00" title="February 20, 2018  7:19PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2018 7:47PM by komradebob.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remember how much <i>Diplomacy</i> was an important influence on early D&amp;D and proto D&amp;D and wargaming culture in general at the time.<br/><br/>Am early D&amp;D campaign with a couple dozen people would be a lot like a Diplomacy game with a couple dozen people.<br/><br/>A "a party" starts as a temporary grouping of participants within the game the same way an "alliance" would work in Diplomacy. It wouldn't be a group pf 6 pals who always get together and play ( especially when death for PCs is so common, and this starting over at 1st level with a newly rolled PC is also common).<br/><br/>If it helps, think of it more like an ongoing, decent sized Camarilla VTM Larp, with less plot and NPCs than usual.<br/><br/><br/>Edited to add:<br/><br/>A couple of other influences to consider<br/><br/><b>High score and your initials on the pinball machine or video game at the arcade/pizza shop/bar/etc<br/></b><br/>Basically, indirect competition and rivalry for bragging rights is still a form of competition, even when direct competition is off the table.<br/><br/><b>Players are supposed to eventually be the main form of competition for one another in the setting</b><br/><br/>It's way more obvious as characters level up and become warlords ( as Eero mentioned), but even at lower levels there's some indirect competition going on in a bi, club, couple dozen players type affairs.<br/><br/>In that set up, the Gm ( GM team) might not actually have nearly as much planned in the way of encounters/dungeons to plunder as you'd normally think. Plan out one major leader with each alignment ( LNC) and one or two minor leaders, 10 large dungeons of varying "dungeon levels" and some random encounter tables and you're good to go. <br/><br/>The PCs aren't 24 buddies heading off into the wilderness for glory and plunder, they're 24 shifty adventurers doing it, all trying to come out on top, or at least find a group of like-minded individuals to group up with and end up the top faction. And of course, that path will be strewn with corpses of unlucky early adventurers being stepped over as late comers enter the fray, attempting the same thing themselves.<br/><br/>Some of those late comers will undoubtedly have names like Melf 2 or Melf 3.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment"

on-line at certain levels - an "exponential" advancement scheme, as it's been called in the 3rd edition era, as contrasted to the "linear" scheme enjoyed by other classes. For a class that gains a significant boost in power at certain levels, that level being delayed does mean something even if it's just one level. A Magic-User waiting for their 5th level is waiting to get their first 3rd level spells, for example.<br/><br/>The other reason why the delayed advancement can matter is that XP comes in rather erratic "chunks". My experience is that the harder you play, the more chunky it is - as in, you might play 10 sessions without gaining any, and then gain a level's worth all at once. If your XP gain is very chunky, that "most of the time you're at the same level" actually turns into "randomly, you'll spend a long time at either the same level or one level behind". In these circumstances that delay has the potential to keep you behind for quite a while; being "just a little bit behind" does not feel meaningless when everybody else has been 2nd level for five sessions as you're still at 1st level, when the jump in power from one level to the next is at its greatest, generally speaking.<br/><br/>That "wait for 2nd level" is the time when the xp limit matters the most in my experience and opinion: there is an almost tactical difference in whether you're trying to amass a thousand points vs. four thousand (to pick some extremes I've seen in leveling threshold between classes in the same campaign). The 2nd level matters a lot for your hit points, and at 1st level your XP gain is probably at its chunkiest. An early score may, will and has easily leveled the cheap classes in the party while leaving the expensive ones waiting. Come mid-levels much of the impact of the drag has been lost, although if you do have a 1 vs 4 situation in there, that 4-level lead will be felt until high levels, I would think.<br/><br/>But that is the extent of it: a wise player realizes this and does not make more of the advancement drag than it really is. (Some few players fail to understand the math and obsess over the different xp schemes unduely.) I view it as a minor, colorful class feature that brings some variety, and fades into non-importance after low levels. It is actually one of the big, fat <i>good</i> parts of the game's math and structure, in a game where I have all sorts of misgivings about the way many things have been traditionally implemented.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470150/#Comment_470150" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-21T23:16:16+00:00" title="February 21, 2018 11:16PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few different things, in my opinion:<br/><br/>* First of all, no one has said that it is the BEST solution, in this case. I'd imagine there could be much better ways to do this. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> (And I'd love to hear some!)<br/><br/>* Some editions/classes vary much more than 25% (up to double, which is effectively a single level tax! - that makes more sense to me).<br/><br/>* At low levels (particularly level 1!), being barred from reaching the next level for a little longer than your comrades can be a deadly threat. In some games, getting that second hit die (double your hit points!) is a really significant breakpoint, and a delay of a session or two could be the difference between "making it" and "starting over".<br/><br/>* In addition to varied XP/level, the <i>level caps</i> are supposed to do much the same thing, I think (aside from genre emulation, as a possible second motive).<br/><br/>I think that, maybe, those two were intended to work together:<br/><br/>Perhaps the combination of "penalized to level up very slowly in the early game" and "can't reach truly high levels in the late game" were deemed sufficient to provide limits on more effective/unusual character classes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470152/#Comment_470152" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-22T00:01:42+00:00" title="February 22, 2018 12:01AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, level caps are a related and interesting concept, let's wrangle those a bit, too.<br/><br/>Level caps certainly were invented in the context of the differing advancement rates, but the draggy advancement was in there before the level cap idea. At least I'm inclined to read the earliest texts with the sense that those class lists aren't really intended to be particularly capped - the idea that the classes only go so far and then stop comes somewhat later in the textual history. The first class write-ups stop at whatever level because you have to stop somewhere and GMs are capable of extrapolating from there, surely.<br/><br/>As for hard and explicit level caps and what they actually accomplish for AD&amp;D (where they came up first, I think?), I couldn't quite say. There are interesting things to do in that area, I think, but official D&amp;D has never quite gotten there, I feel. Like, wouldn't it be more interesting if the cap was some sort of retirement/epilogue thing instead of being "sure you can adventure more, it just won't benefit you any, and you'll in fact be effectively wasting xp that could be going to characters who can use it"? Or if, instead of linearizing the level-up XP thresholds at name level, like the game traditionally does, you instead "capped" some classes by having them retain a much slower type of xp scheme - you could effectively slow down progress to a crawl without stopping it completely, which might, properly tuned, result in something more interesting than the flat-out capping AD&amp;D does.<br/><br/>One thing I've thought of doing myself with the level cap thing is giving non-human PCs a non-leveled type of character progression where instead of leveling you "evolve" like a pokemon, from one monster-type stat block to another, independent of conventional XP schemes. This doesn't have to have anything to do with level caps, but it could: imagine if your Dark Cultist or some such leveled normally until level 4 (my example is low because my campaigns tend towards the lower end of the level range) where they hit a level cap, and that qualifies them to become a "Vampire", a 6 HD creatures with a wide variety of supernatural powers. Then a Vampire can, given the right conditions, evolve into a 10 HD super-vampire of some sort. Essentially you stop progressing in levels at the cap and instead start progressing in terms of discrete, specific questing goals. The character could even still use XP for something without leveling from it. (I like tracking them just for their own sake, frankly - I'd do it even if there were no level-ups at all just to have something to build high score lists from.)<br/><br/>Level caps, name levels, switching to different leveling up schemes at high levels, prestige classes... there is a constellation of mechanical building blocks there for doing interesting things at the tail-end of character advancement. Lots of recombining possibilities for unique campaign takes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470155/#Comment_470155" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-22T02:26:15+00:00" title="February 22, 2018  2:26AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that, Eero.<br/><br/>You could even simply change up the rules for XP when those transformations happen (e.g. instead of collecting XP for treasure, you get it for innocent souls drained or temples desecrated, or whatever thing).

The teleological chain of actions that strives towards apotheosis by gaining ever more XP is the direction of the story in D&amp;D. The camera follows those beings in the otherwise fairly arbitrated and essentially static world who strive to gather experience points.<br/><br/>(This all has nothing to do with D&amp;D being a story game or something like that; rather, I describe the internal paradox of a game that simultaneously insists that swords totally should do realistic amounts of damage while heroic fighters totally should not die when you hit them with a sword. If D&amp;D has any sort of identity aside from being the "generic wargame-rpg with the d20 die", it is in how it attempts to simulate medieval warfare at low levels and fantasy stories at high levels, enabling a seamless transition between them during a campaign.)<br/><br/>To bring that observation back to the original topic quickly: one way to determine which classes you want to progress how fast in your campaign would be to say that a quickly leveling class requires little to decouple from what is real and embrace what is fantastic, while a slowly leveling class is less attuned to the romantic high-level realities.<br/><br/>Considering non-human characters who are player characters, yet nevertheless are not leveled and do not collect XP in this context, I am attracted to the idea that they are in an essential sense mere pawns or sidekicks. For this reason my pondering upon non-classed or level-capped (same thing in the sense that at some point you are no longer in the process of leveling) characters circles around the ways they can act in supportive and conditional roles around "real heroes". Sort of "token alien" approach, if you will; we all know who the real protagonist is, he's the guy who's actually in this adventure to level up.<br/><br/>This kind of effect might be achieved by defining the goals and motivations of non-leveling PCs very clearly. For example, consider this alternative treatment of the concept of "Elf":<br/><br/><b>Elf (PC monster)</b><br/><br/>Elves are forest-dwelling fairie critters as per Tolkien, no surprises there. You cannot create an elven player character in a conventional way. However, a party may gain elven members in the following ways:<br/><b>*</b> Successfully petitioning the Elf-King for aid. Minor aid, granted for courtesy, consists of an Elf (1 HD). Major aid, granted when interests align, consists of an Elf Prince (4 HD) and 2d4 Elves or low fae (Gnomes, whatnot). Existential aid, granted when the elves themselves are threatened, consists of an Elf-King (8 HD) and the appropriate retinue.<br/><b>*</b> A party of proven Elf-Friends may be joined by an Elf or Elf Prince of prior acquaintance, sent by the Elf-King, on adventures that specifically concern the elves. Such aid appears unasked and may or may not have subtle motives.<br/><b>*</b> An elf in love with a human may choose to join a task personally important to their human, even outside the interests of the elven realm. If their human is slain in the quest, the elf perishes as well out of grief.<br/>These are all the legal quests for elven characters. When a quest of this nature ends, an elven character leaves the party and returns to the elven domain.<br/><br/>Elves played as player characters are fixed-HD PC Monsters, which means that they do not gain experience points (and therefore do not cost shares from others, either; having an elf along is like having a dog, not like having a henchman). Instead, their goals are discrete and quest-related. An Elf that successfully completes their assigned quest and returns home is promoted, assuming they've won the favour of the Elf-King with their quest: Elf -&gt; Elf Prince -&gt; Elf-King, gaining all the advantages of their new form. This promotion occurs during a long down-time period in the elven forests; it cannot be strategically planned for or scheduled, the only way for it to occur is for the players to let the Elf go, and come back later in the campaign in a mightier form.<br/><br/>A few basics about the different elven evolution stages:<br/><br/><b>Elf:</b> The basic elf is roughly similar to your 1st level Basic D&amp;D elf. Some minor fey abilities and such, but basically a forest-delving human. Relatively easy to shake up from the elven domain for a wide variety of purposes; the Elf-King always has a few that want to see the world.<br/><br/><b>Elf Prince:</b> 4 HD elite elves. Substantial magical abilities and fey lore; I'd probably go with a flexible sort of magic with wide utility and respectable combat power as well, but that depends on the precise nature of what elves are like in the setting. Elf Princes have the unique capability of abandoning the elven way of life and becoming a real adventurer; if one does, they cease being a PC monster and instead become a 1st level adventurer in the elf character class. (They retain all of their capabilities, but level-based abilities do not stack with the monster template, so e.g. they're stuck at 4 HD until achieving 5th level as an adventurer.)<br/><br/><b>Elf-King:</b> 8 HD super elves with all the archetypal elven abilities, and substantial political clout among the fey kind. Elf-Kings are more like support cast than adventurers, even if they're PCs, because they only ever adventure in defense of their realm, or for love. Besides, they don't really have an advancement path, barring extraordinary events; they're already at the pinnacle of what they are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470160/#Comment_470160" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-22T03:51:28+00:00" title="February 22, 2018  3:51AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The major point of treating demihumans in this way is to make their participation in any given adventure contingent on GM-controlled wider campaign considerations. The elf is still a genuine player character in that he's allowed to have a personality and personal hopes and goals; it's just that their story is inextricably tied with the elven realm, rather than some detailed and micromanaged adventuring lifestyle. Your elf character is somebody who joins the party only occasionally, and their very success (assuming that you'll allow them to evolve - I'm assuming that a player can tell the GM if they don't want their elf to evolve) catapults them quickly and powerfully "out of scope" of where the campaign currently sits.<br/><br/>It is probably clear that in this scheme the main balancing element for the super-fast advancement of the elves is the fact that the stronger the elf, the less adventures you'll find where bringing in the elf to help is going to be pertinent; the elf should be something respectably powerful when you <i>can</i> bring them, but you can't rely on them all the time. I chose to add the idea that you could turn this sort of PC monster into a real adventurer in the above write-up, which could turn into a moderate sort of power play (finish one adventure with an Elf, let them evolve into an Elf Prince, turn them into an adventurer, continue progressing normally except now you've got a 4 HD chassis on a 1st level adventurer), but that's nothing too unbalanced for me as a GM - normal PCs are at level 2 or 3 at least by the time the elf prince is ready to start their career as a normal adventurer.<br/><br/>But anyway, something like that could be interesting: treat demihumans as supporting monster characters that pop in and out of the campaign, and perhaps Awanthain the Elf who accompanied you once on an adventure has risen to great stature among his people the next time you see him. Have exotic monster-specific evolution trees that require the monsters to go on highly specific types of adventures if they want to evolve in certain ways. Sometimes maybe bring them in as real adventurers, but perhaps only for a time, because a level cap hits and they're now back to being static, but perhaps in a new plateau/identity/stage of evolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470166/#Comment_470166" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-22T10:31:34+00:00" title="February 22, 2018 10:31AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> That would be vastly more appealing to me if we dropped the concept of "demihuman" entirely and started talking "friendly intelligent monsters".

I was mainly thinking that they'd work well as a sort of casual player character choice, a change of pace when you'd be starting a new character anyway for this adventure, except it's an elf adventure so you could play an elf instead and do another human the next time around when the exotic elf option won't make sense. Or you're just visiting the campaign occasionally rather than playing every week, a character that progresses quickly and mostly off-screen would work well for that.<br/><br/>But henchmen, yeah - that could be <i>very</i> interesting. Unlike a human henchman the elven "stable" could progress pretty fast if the party kept hanging out with elves. The lowly elf you picked up in that one adventure could easily be the Elf Prince the next time, being the strongest member of the party. And who knows whether you can <i>really</i> trust the elves. They are alien, after all.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I haven't seen a d&amp;d concept which enforced character downtime before; there's lots of room for exploration there, I think.</p></div></blockquote>\nIt's an interesting possibility, yes.

(That doesn't go for downtime - you run the downtime for your entire stable as necessary.) If the circumstances strongly suggest that two characters of the same player have a stake in the same adventure, and one can't e.g. hire the other to take the case on their stead, I'll allow the player to run multiple characters. I prefer to only do this when there's real need and want; if you just want more hands on deck, or enjoy running many characters, get henchmen.<br/><br/>If an important elf was participating in an important elf adventure, and the same player is running the group's leader or some other indispensable member, then I guess that would be precisely the sort of situation where I'd have the player run both characters side by side.<br/><br/>The somewhat distant, alien nature of this sort of elf would well justify giving the elf to another player, too. Normally we don't trade characters between players, but I could see myself treating the "PC monster" differently; maybe they are joint property of the group, such that when an adventure develops such that there's a chance to bring in the elven part of the character stable, any player can claim them for the session. I don't know if the players would like this as much as each elf being earmarked for specific players, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
