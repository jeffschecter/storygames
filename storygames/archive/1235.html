                    This is a very little idea that's been bouncing around in the back of my head:<br/><br/>How is a mutual failure not a whiff?<br/><br/>To "whiff" usually means that an unopposed fortune mechanic resulted in failure.  If I'm speaking negatively of the mechanic, it probably means that the mechanic results is failures frequently.<br/><br/>An orthogonal conflict means that two characters have goals that can each resolve positively or negatively independently.  We can both succeed or both fail, or either one of us could succeed on our own.<br/><br/>Boneheaded definitions out of the way, what I'm looking at is, if the "both fail" option is a frequent occurrence, is that really a whiff?  (As an aside, I'm also not clear on how a passively opposed fortune mechanic avoids whiffage - but it seems to me I've seen it proposed as a solution.)<br/><br/>Musing here: if we accept that a fortune-in-middle resolution system side-steps whiffage by excluding meaningless failure, can't mutual failure in an orthogonal system reintroduce it?  I kind of feel like both-fail is worse than a normal whiff: you go from "Well, I suck" to "Wow, we all suck."  <br/><br/>Would there be merit in a general pattern of orthogonal conflict, such that two goals cannot both fail?                </div>

                            I think it depends on the specific system involved -- in something like Dogs, losing a conflict isn't a whiff because there's all sorts of stuff that happens and fallout that's accrued.  If you can imagine two sets of that happening to two different characters, does it matter if they didn't get their end goal?                        </div>

                            As far as I'm concerned, whiffing is not the same thing as failing an action or having something go wrong. The latter things are quite desirable in role-playing situations, as far as I'm concerned. Whiffing refers, I think, more to the <i>sensation</i> one has when playing through a series of failures, or failures that are handled descriptively and mechanically in a particular way.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that gives rise that sensation is a game in which a high score doesn't reflect much of a better chance than a low score except in the long run across many instances. Percentile systems like Rolemaster or Call of Cthulhu are very, very prone to this. No one believes me when I explain the statistical reason why, but here it is: if I have a sword score of 78%, and you have a sword score of 04%, and we each get one chance to hit one another this round - just one! that's it! - then the actual score levels don't mean a damn thing.<br/>
<br/>
You guys are all gonna call me crazy and scream about how 78 is more than 4, blah blah, but the fact is, it's only more than 4 across a series of instances, not in a one-roll comparison. That's how probabilities work. Think about it ... you've got that 78 sword score, and you've missed the toothy critter three times in this combat round, and dammit, with three misses, isn't it about "due" for a hit this time? The human mind doesn't deal with probabilities well; it seems so <i>sensible</i> to say three consecutive misses means your hit is now more likely on the next try, but that's why people keep playing the lottery after losing every week for twenty years in a row.<br/>
<br/>
(I could go on and talk about why that means that critical hits and fumbles were so central to that system, and also to the basic d20 ancestor, the D&amp;D to-hit roll, because extreme values actually showed up more consistently than any competence-based assessment of hits and misses. Another thread, some day.)<br/>
<br/>
Another situation that gives rise to the sensation is when failing the attempt doesn't make anything happen. So you either get something, or tread water. This is what leads to those horrible fights-that-never-end, weary, roll-miss-tune-out sessions. One of the nice things about Sorcerer is that failed rolls tend to be consequential in some way, even if it's a just a rearrangement of position and opportunity during, say, a fight scene. A lot of recent Forge-y games are predicated on stuff happening no matter what ... in Perfect, if you fail to resist the Interrogation, you gain some Fallout for an Aspect, but you don't suffer the Fallout for the Aspects you used when fighting the Interrogation. Whereas if you resist successfully, you gain nothing bad on your sheet, but you do suffer that Fallout. It's neat.<br/>
<br/>
Best, Ron                        </div>

                            Another element of whiffing, somewhat related to the 'higher scores don't mean that much' point, is when the competence that your character appears to possess (in the SIS, description of the mechanics, mind of the player, etc.) does not actually result in a feeling of competence in the actual mechanics. If the game tells me that a 18 in Strength means I'm this incredibly strong dude, and then I go to pick up a heavy barrel and I can't; and then I go to wrestle a crocodile and I lose; and then I try to break down a door and I bruise my shoulder... then eventually I'm going to be like 'why did I ever make the mistake of investing in my character as a strong dude, when he obviously is nothing of the sort?' It doesn't necessarily help if I did a few successful strong things between those events -- the dissonance remains. When the description of the character's attributes (given by the books, but also maybe developped in play) ends up being totally out of alignment with his or her actual mechanical competence, failures are far more likely to feel like whiffs.                        </div>

Which is why I always preferred a .32 to a .45 in CoC: ROF of 3.  More seriously, I think that your assertion is equally true for any system with a linearly increasing probability of success, regardless of how it's expressed.  Yes, the Gambler's Paradox isn't very widely well understood.  On the other hand, I'd pick the 78%-er every time.

Sure.  And I appreciate you fleshing out what was obviously a very anemic description of the whiff.  <br><br>One motivation for conflict resolution (and setting stakes, not to dredge that right back up) is certainly to have all the consequences of resolution mean something - because that keeps players interested.  One way of doing that is to make conflicts oppositional: either I get what I want or you do.  Instant meaning.<br><br>A naive approach to orthogonal goals (which I've seen in several games recently) simply applied the framework of oppositional conflict, and unintentionally re-opens the issue of a whiff factor, because two characters might both fail.  <cite>The Shadow of Yesterday</cite> is occasionally prone to this effect, if two characters have parallel actions and aren't very good at them.  <cite>Mortal Coil</cite> cleverly avoids this issue by allowing reallocation (although it might be possible that we're swinging at each other, each realize that we want to reallocated to defend, leaving both of us defending against nuthin.)<br><br>I just want to shine a light on that possibility.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            For my two cents, "whiff" is "nothing happens" which usually but not always is tied to character failure via mechanics.<br><br>(I've had lots of mechanical successes which also didn't change anything -- how many games have we all been in when the GM gives you a puzzle to overcome and you roll dice to do something, but it's not the "right thing" and so even though you succeed, you don't actually, you know, <em>succeed</em>.)<br><br>But "whiff" is when the situation/scene doesn't change after all the effort of looking up stats, proposing an action, rolling dice, calculating scores, and so on.  If all that does nothing, that's a wasted sixty seconds.<br/><br/>That's fixed by oppositional-stakes-with-counterstakes (either way, something's going to happen).<br/>That's fixed by stakes-with-fallout* (my prefered Dogs interpretation).<br/>That's fixed with orthogonal-stakes-with-fallout.<br/><br/>It's not fixed with orthogonal stakes when there's no fallout and there's no counterstakes.<br/><br/>* Fallout doesn't have to be called "fallout" in the game to be fallout -- losing hit points is fallout; spending willpower points is fallout; breaking your sword is fallout.  Fallout here just means "side-effect to the conflict at hand."                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<p>Play some Shock: and you'll see one way to deal with this.</p>
<p>You get resources for failing. Mutual failure just shows more about the characters involved.</p>
<p>It's like that because conflicts are there not to foil endeavors, but to act as turning points in the story. There are four possible outcomes to every conflict, so there are four ways for the story to go.</p>
<p>This is simple: if failure means that you <em>don't</em> do something, then it's a dead ball. That's bad.</p>
<p>If failure means that something other than you wanted to happen happens, that's an active situation. That's good.</p>
<p>Whiffing, to me, means a systematically supported denial of input through the resolution system.</p>

                            What JACN said - whiffage is when you roll and nothing happens.  You roll to hit the orc and you you miss ... but there's no consequence to that miss.

                            I think there is a little more to it than nothing happens isn't there?  I think Ron is right when he talks about it being a sensation.<br/><br/>To me, and perhaps this is simply a personal definition, whiffing implies that the failure in some way undermined my sense of the game.  For example, I have a badass swordsman with 78% sword and I just miss some guy.  That isn't very badass.  I don't expect to hit every time, but just plain missing undermines the concept, it undermines my expectation of the game, my guy is not a badass swordsman he's someone who can just plain miss.  <br/><br/>The whiff for me isn't the nothing happens, it's the nothing happens when I could reasonably expect something should happen.  If I have sword 4% guy and I miss, well, I already have a concept of my guy as a crap swordsman.  I probably don't expect much to happen.  My 78% guy conceptually to me is a good swordsman, missing undermines that.<br/><br/>So I think the whiff is more than merely dull failure, it is failure which undermines concept.  That is why though something happening is important, I don't just miss, I get the sun in my eye and am distracted, I hit but my sword skitters off his armour, I hit but am off balance due to uneven ground and do no harm, any of those things mechanically is the same as I miss but they don't undermine my concept of character or game world.<br/><br/>If I miss and the GM says "you miss and flail wildly making bystanders jump away from fear you will accidentally hit them" then something has definitely happened, but if my concept is that my guy is a badass swordsman I've still whiffed as the failure has directly undermined my concept.  It's not that nothing happened, it's that the nothing or the wrong something happened.                        </div>

                            One thing to add.<br/><br/>I think it was the Forge that drew my attention to this issue, which then struck me as something terribly obvious that I had never given any thought to.<br/><br/>Whiffing sucks, it's dull and can damage the internal logic of the game.  Nowadays, I don't mind people missing, but if the concept is say a badass swordsman I will work in an explanation of why they miss that does not invalidate the concept.  It is I think a useful thing to do.<br/><br/>Nothing happening doesn't always conflict with concept of course, when it does I don't personally tend to think of it as whiffing, but it is still dull and undesirable for that reason.  I miss, I miss, I hit, I miss is just dull, even if it does fit concept fine.                        </div>

                            Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Guys, you'll do better to lose the "stakes" terminology, I'm gonna ride this hobbyhorse for a while. We are talking about orthogonal <i>conflicts</i>; the "stakes" word isn't in there, and if it is, it's not doing anything.<br/>
<br/>
Ice Cream Emperor - yup. I've often discussed this as the flat-curve element of dice or other fortune-y mechanics. If one wants to use a flat-distribution method (i.e. rolling a single die, most obviously), then the system should include very frequent rolling with relatively minor (albeit interesting) effects. Otherwise the linearity will getcha. This is also why re-roll mechanics are so wonderful for such systems; The Dying Earth had a big influence on Trollbabe for that exact variable.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, the key to not whiffing is to have well-articulated conflicts of interest. That has nothing to do with orthogonal vs. oppositional, as a definitional issue. What you guys are seeing, I think, is that orthogonal conflicts <i>tend</i> to be better articulated in terms of what's up with failure.<br/>
<br/>
Nearly all traditional RPG resolution is both neutrally-oppositional and "tread water" oriented. You investigate the library in a Call of Cthulhu scenario. You fail the roll, so you go to the library and nothing happens. What stopped you? Uh, the Dewey Decimal system was out of place, or you were just kind of stupid for a minute there. Doesn't really matter. Something "stopped" you and nothing happened.<br/>
<br/>
So that's what we all might tend to associated with oppositional conflict, and thus when a person encounters (a) orthogonal conflict and (b) non-whiffing in the same text - which is Sorcerer &amp; Sword, that's where you're remembering it from, Balbinus - it seems like the one is a feature of the other.<br/>
<br/>
But it's not. Non-whiffing is a function of well-articulated, imaginatively-committed conflicts of interest. For those who are interested, there's a good thread, <b><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21236.0" rel="nofollow">[Sorcerer] Orthogonal &amp; oppositional conflicts</a></b>, in the Adept Press forum.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>The whiff for me isn't the nothing happens, it's the nothing happens when I could reasonably expect something should happen.  If I have sword 4% guy and I miss, well, I already have a concept of my guy as a crap swordsman.  I probably don't expect much to happen.  My 78% guy conceptually to me is a good swordsman, missing undermines that.<br/></blockquote>
And if the dice come up 79, both guys miss just as much, barring incidentals of narration.  But the 4% swordsman is an excellent example: if the system is going to let me have a 4% Sword skill, and make me use it, that's minimum 5 minutes of my time the system has wasted reminding me that my character sucks.  That's almost as appealing as paying $5 to be cockpunched.  <br/><br/>Taking that further, because I'd like to see a vocabulary of critique take off: I don't think I'm alone in that view.  I think it's completely valid to describe a system that produces dead ball failures (a phrase for which I laud Josh Newman) as having a whiff factor.  
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kuma</cite>I'm not saying that whiffing is just missing - just that orthogonal stakes can't whiff by their very nature.</blockquote>
That's exactly the concept I'm trying to debunk, because I can see that it's out there, and I don't think it's true.<br/><br/>Tell you what: here's a conflict mechanic:
<blockquote><br/>...the two players assign goals to their characters, which they may accomplish over the course of resolution.  The can go back and forth altering their goals until they're both happy with them.  The goals cannot be mutually exclusive - in other words, if one character accomplishes his goal, the other must be able to also accomplish his goal as well, and vice versa.<br/><br/>Figure out which skill each character will roll against and roll a die.  Any character whose player rolls a success accomplishes his goal.  Failure indicates the goal is not accomplished...<br/></blockquote>
Now, you've got serious whiff factor, and necessarily orthogonal conflict in what's a pretty reasonable system.<br/><br/>The mistake I see made is conflating oppositional conflict (where if I fail, you get what you want - no dead ball) with orthogonal conflict (where we could both fail - and there's a dead ball.)<br/><br/>What has to happen is either the both-fail result gets something to fill it in, or it gets elided from the the system completely.                        </div>

                            judson,<br/><br/>On my example, and I simply used the percentages for continuity of example there's no magic to the numbers taken, if Sue is trying to hit Bob and Sue has a 4% skill and Bob a 78% dodge skill and Sue hits and Bob flubs, that is a plain oppositional conflict but I would still think that Bob has whiffed if his concept is Bob the dodger.  The whiff is in the unexpected incompetence isn't it?<br/><br/>Similarly, if I'm playing Bob the librarian and I have given Bob a 4% fight skill because I see Bob as an incompetent fighter, having to roll  that is not a problem as I have chosen to be incompetent in that field, it is part of my concept.  Not everything I do has to be something I'm good at.<br/><br/>Perhaps it would help to define what we mean by whiff, is it simply dead time in which nothing happens?  I had thought there was more to it, disempowering dead time as it were.  If Bob and Sue are master fencers, they clash and neither gains advantage that may be dramatic - two swords locked together, the null result is not necessarily a problem.<br/><br/>Going back to basics then, where do you see the problem as coming in?  Is whiff to you simply a term for an uninteresting result which doesn't move the game forward in any way?                        </div>

                            Where to start is tricky, 'cause you were sort of thinking &amp; typing &amp; riffing at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
OK, the whole issue lies with how you, as the writer of the example, are expressing your personal history with a description like "Sue flubs the roll badly." There is a <i>whole</i> lotta task-resolution orientation lying under that sentence, I think - and this isn't just me in the armchair, I'm drawing on <i>seven years</i> of direct and indirect dialogue between the two of us, across at least three active websites.<br/>
<br/>
If we were talking about playing Call of Cthulhu, which is a good model for a task-resolution game and also incredibly influential on literally hundreds of subsequent games, then "Sue flubs the roll badly" is very often a whiff. The % system, the overall scenario need to "move plot along" (and thus hop to some other scene as soon as she fails), and in fact the very emphasis on character helplessness, in many applications, all tend to marginalize individual actions.<br/>
<br/>
Let's take that to this relatively abstract sword-fight you're talking about (and which suffers badly from its abstraction, actually, for this purpose). Somehow, some way, we have to imagine that both characters have history and passions wrapped up in the McGuffin, hence it's <i>not</i> a McGuffin, not a find-it scenario or anything like that. This isn't a who-gets-it-first contest - this whole conflict <i>matters</i> in the sense of ... oh, let's say in the sense of whether Napoleon Dynamite busts out the dance moves or not, up on stage.<br/>
<br/>
So if Sue misses, what matters is not only that Bob's path to the whatever-it-is is clear. What matters is that Bob has <i>beaten</i> Sue. Even if her roll was "internal," i.e., a task roll regarding how well she pulled off a combat maneuver. In narrative (I choose that word carefully, it's not "narrational") terms, when opponent A runs up the stairs and opponent B simply trips on his way up, A really has beaten B.<br/>
<br/>
What I'm trying to get across (a) in this terrible medium for it and (b) regarding an approach to play which is not frankly very well-developed among all of us, is that the <i>logistic</i> problem of who gets to the thing first is an expression or opportunity for the <i>basic/real</i> problem of what kinds of characters Bob and Sue are, as expressed so far, and how they personally relate to the whatever-it-is, and to one another.<br/>
<br/>
The desire to get to the object first, which both have, is only a conflict of interest if it matters at that level. Otherwise it's a task-resolution logic/probability problem, with no juice, no point, and no actual reason to roll. Which is why so many games of this type often drift to GM fiat, and conversely, why people who think "rolling" must mean something no matter what spend four hours playing characters trying to work a Xerox machine (I'm not being sarcastic; this happened).<br/>
<br/>
So when you say "here's a clear conflict of interest" in your example, you are right ... logistically. But I'm saying that's fantastic <i>only if</i> the logistic conflict gets us jazzed about the (I hate to use this word) issue at hand, regarding these characters and what they've done, what they want, and so on, so far in play.<br/>
<br/>
If that is indeed the case, then "Sue flubs her roll badly" is not a blocker. It is a statement. It is an outcome (or part of the system for an outcome, depending on the game used), and such outcomes are <i>why we play</i> in the sense I'm talking about. It is the agony of defeat which matters here, it's catharsis if we want to get into college-level lit about it, and to be less twee, it's just fuckin' fun this way. In fact, in such a situation, if a GM were to pull fiat and say, "aw, re-roll," that would really really suck.<br/>
<br/>
But yeah. If it's <i>only</i> a logistic situation and hence "conflict of interest" only in that two objects (Bob and Sue) cannot be in the same space at once ... well, the "interest" is absent. And hence any failure is just "she can't." Why? "I dunno, the dice say so, she can't."<br/>
<br/>
Note as well that in the classic my-character your-world play-space, player participation is often wholly bound up with character task-success, as an ongoing thing. So in that circumstance, not only is Sue's failure boring in an in-world sense, but it's only punishing to the player's participation. Yeeesh! Talk about your whiffs.<br/>
<br/>
So I'm suggesting that your play-background is heavily bound up with these pitfalls, and so it's not immediately easy for you to see the fruits of failure in the terms I'm harping on - specifically, what "conflict of interest" means above and beyond the mere (although necessary) logistics of the situation.<br/>

Absolutely, I'm querying this stuff precisely because my background and underlying assumptions get in the way of my getting the point being made.  Half the reason I am interested in indie games is to get a perspective outside the one I am predisposed to have.  <br><br>I come, as you rightly say, from literally years of task based mechanics experience and that necessarily makes a debate like this a bit trickier for me, as I need to step outside that perspective.  It also makes getting games like, say, PTA a bit harder as the underlying assumptions are alien to my experience.  Again, that is precisely why I find playing games like PTA rewarding, it takes me outside my assumptions and I find that a refreshing and helpful thing.<br><br>Anyway, I found your post very helpful, sufficiently so that I think I now get your point, I think it is correct and as such I have nothing much further to add.                        </br></br></br></br></div>
