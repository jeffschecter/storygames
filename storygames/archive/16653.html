Since Burning Wheel first came out, in 2002, we have seen two revisions (Revised in 2005 and Gold in 2011), the derived games Burning Empires and Mouse Guard, and THREE settings (Serpent Sun, Burning Sands and Blossoms).<br/><br/>So the question becomes, is that enough content over 10 years to pay on the order of $25 a year? If you had subscribed in 2002. you would have paid $250 at $25 a year by now. You would have paid on the order of $200 if you just bought the books. And it could CERTAINLY be argued that another $5 a year for online ease would be worth it. THAT is what people have to decide. AND ... under a subscription model, they are being asked to decide up front. Granted... if ALL of the previous content is available at the start (a dubious notion given I included both Burning Empire and Mouse Guard in my tally) then it may certainly be worth the FIRST year at the very least.<br/><br/>Just something to think about. I'm not as certain Burning Wheel as a MAINTAINED game will survive. No one is going to show up at my house to confiscate my books... so we will be playing regardless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elf_NFB" title="Elf_NFB"><img alt="Elf_NFB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elf_NFB">Elf_NFB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380945/#Comment_380945" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-06T06:12:33+00:00" title="June  6, 2012  6:12AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did a bit of digging and found THIS snippet from Luke Crane:<br/><br/><i>I'll give you all some insider knowledge: The PDF sales of those games -- one of which outsold BWR in print -- are so low and the cost of trouble shooting everyone's Internet Explorer download fail is so high, it is no worth my time to make BW available as a pdf. <br/><br/>Plus, Burning Wheel is meant to be experienced as a book.

I'm still traumatized by the 10 copies of the BWC PDF I sold that propagated onto every server in the known universe. I cannot be a party to such a crime!</i><br/><br/>That explains a bit more. He's pissed that only 10 copies were sold! But that isn't the whole story. WHEN was BWC released as a pdf? Was it after it went out of print as BWR was being prepped? It was certainly before 2005 when BWR was released. That was a time when game pdfs were CONSTANTLY stolen. That just doesn't happen as much any more. Sure... you can find copies out there. And it REALLY isn't a difficult thing to do. But again and again it has been shown by studies of the music and film industry that such theft has no real effect on the bottom line. Those who steal the items are not really going to buy them any way. <br/><br/>Still... Luke feels betrayed and angry that someone stole from him. Understandable.. but I feel it is a little sad.

Please take it with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>I payed $8-10 a month for D&amp;D Insider when it was Character Creation tools, Adventures, Articles, Updated Content but most importantly...<br/><br/>1. I played D&amp;D weekly<br/>2. The Character Creation tools could be used offline<br/>3. The Character Creation tools could be used, without updates, even after you ended the service (or D&amp;D stopped the service, say if they changed editions)<br/><br/>To be honest, although this doesn't make a lot of rational sense, I think there is very little I wouldn't pay (as long as I could afford it) if I was playing Burning Wheel regularly just to support a friend who does work I greatly admire.<br/><br/>That said, my experience with D&amp;D Insider has made me hesitant to pay for subscriptions where I don't retain content after the subscription is over and I can't use the service offline (once Wizards changed what I liked about D&amp;D Insider, I cancelled my subscription). This doesn't mean I'm against it, just feel hesitant. I also like to create characters on the subway, airplane, on busses... lots of places without internet access... even many conventions don't have reliable internet access. That's a challenging hurdle for me to jump.<br/><br/>When I think of character creation tools, I think of apps. And many of the apps I use are either pay once or pay per use. <br/><br/>But I would likely pay a yearly or monthly subscription for a steady flow of adventure content. <br/><br/>On the flip side, I pay for Netflix which is highly unreliable, and I don't watch it all the time, but I pay for bulk content. There is so much content, there is probably something I want to watch. Although as Netflix content gets crappier I've contemplated dropping their service and have started using Zune and iTunes more where I pay for content as I use it. My friends have HBO but they only use HBO for specific TV shows.

If buying direct from the author means getting the book+PDF, I'll buy direct where I can. <br/><br/>I also really like buying PDFs for games I'm not entirely sure I will play but would like to read and support the designer.<br/><br/>That all said...<br/><br/>If a designer doesn't want to sell a PDF, for any reason (disclosed or not), I completely 100% support their right to do so and will try not to bother them about it. <br/><br/>RPG publishing is a part time job, and a poorly paying one for most people.

My gut feeling is the first year would get a lot of backing from fans wanting to support the game, whether they needed the tool or not.  But if people haven't' actually used the tool except to play around with it, they may find themselves fairly reluctant to resubscribe.  This is particularly true for the upper end of the price range.<br/><br/>Myself, I'd have to say I wouldn't be inclined to subscribe for the following reasons:<ol><li>I play lots of RPGs.  If they all wanted me to subscribe, it'd get silly.</li>\n<li>Flexibility.  I have spent enough time playing around with the BW lifepath system to realize that it encodes a lot of setting decisions, many of them extremely arbitrary.  In an actual game, the GM and table may wish to customize them for their setting.  Even if the tool allows for entering your own additions and changes, sharing a particular set of changes among a particular set of characters belonging to a particular set of players seems non-trivial.</li>\n<li>It's not like its all that hard to generate characters using the books.</li>\n<li>When I make BW characters, I often find myself scanning through the lifepath entries linearly.  If the tool doesn't allow that, it's a no-go.  If it does, then it is very likely as vulnerable to piracy as a PDF anyway.</li>\n<li>BWHQ is a small company.  Small companies in the RPG field have had a high mortality rate.  This makes a subscription more of a risk.</li></ol> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381011/#Comment_381011" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-06T10:58:02+00:00" title="June  6, 2012 10:58AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>Thanks for your input.

Of course, it also combined submissions from many, many d20 PDF publishers and came out on an approximately weekly basis.  <br/><br/>I strongly considered the Adamant Thrilling Tales subscription service when it came out but in the end decided not to, since the occasional compilation was more useful to me than monthly content.  Pulp games weren't consistent with me, though I loved them.<br/><br/>I'd check out the BW subscription service and see what's what.  But whether I bought in would be more due to my personal gaming situation rather than anything the service offered or didn't offer.<br/><br/>Organized play will get more subscriptions than anything else. When you can create an RPGA for your game and get it moving, the subscriptions will sell themselves.

Since Burning Wheel first came out, in 2002, we have seen two revisions (Revised in 2005 and Gold in 2011), the derived games Burning Empires and Mouse Guard, and THREE settings (Serpent Sun, Burning Sands and Blossoms).<br/><br/>So the question becomes, is that enough content over 10 years to pay on the order of $25 a year? If you had subscribed in 2002. you would have paid $250 at $25 a year by now. You would have paid on the order of $200 if you just bought the books. And it could CERTAINLY be argued that another $5 a year for online ease would be worth it. THAT is what people have to decide. AND ... under a subscription model, they are being asked to decide up front. Granted... if ALL of the previous content is available at the start (a dubious notion given I included both Burning Empire and Mouse Guard in my tally) then it may certainly be worth the FIRST year at the very least.<br/><br/><br/>The problem for me is that the economics of this only applies if you bought ALL the books.  I play a lot of different games. I don't for one minute begrudge Luke the money I spent on them, even if some have seen more play than others.  But I didn't buy every single book he wrote.  Overall I've probably shipped him $150 over the years, so now its $10 a year for online (worse if I can't get it when I'm offline).  This is even worse for people who just bought Mouse Guard for example.<br/><br/>Whenever I see these sorts of figures worked out I feel like you need the all in consumer vs the average consumer.  I had a similar issue with D&amp;D insider.

This is way cheaper than D&amp;Di;, going to one of my favorite designers, and makes it easier for me to play one of my all-time favorite games.
