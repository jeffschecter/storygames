A private deadline really isn't that much of a deadline, unless you have a whole lot of will. Having a deadline in the public eye appears to generate a lot more actual action.<br/><br/>I'm wondering if there are ways to harness this notion for personal game designs (that is, not as part of a design contest). Can the "public deadline" be implemented in a way meaningful enough to push designers into progress outside of a contest?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300884/#Comment_300884" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-15T12:21:42+00:00" title="November 15, 2010 12:21PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Group effort is the one way that comes to mind, like a crew of people who make a commitment to each month review where they're at, and set goals to be accomplished by next month.

I think Chris originally meant for it to be about plans going forward, but it's mostly morphed into what Bret's describing.<br/><br/>Personally, I think deadlines often do as much harm as good, especially for complex and hard-to-estimate things like designing games. Deadlines create a lot of perverse psychological incentives, like slacking off when the deadline is far off and then abandoning the project when you can't make up for lost time as the deadline approaches.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300899/#Comment_300899" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-15T14:03:34+00:00" title="November 15, 2010  2:03PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2010 2:04PM by Wordman.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't find either of those incentives particularly perverse.<br/><br/>Assuming a person responds to both of those incentives, does the presence of the deadline make the production of a game more or less likely? I submit that it doesn't actually make a difference. The only real difference is that, with the deadline, the world gets the certainty that the game will be produced or abandoned more honestly and sooner than waiting for a delivery that will never come.<br/><br/>In other words, there may be some fringe case of someone approaching the deadline and saying "screw it, to much work, abandon whole notion" and, thus, not producing a game that would otherwise get made eventually; however, I suspect that the type of person who would do that is the type of person who would have never finished and released the game anyway. In that case, the deadline is still positive, because it gets them to move on.<br/><br/>More likely, someone missing a deadline says something like "darn missed deadline. sorry everyone. here is the new deadline".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300905/#Comment_300905" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-15T14:30:20+00:00" title="November 15, 2010  2:30PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wordman</cite>In other words, there may be some fringe case of someone approaching the deadline...</blockquote>\nMiserable people not accomplishing things and then getting shamed and demoralized for not hitting deadlines isn't a fringe case, it's standard operating procedure in most of corporate America.
