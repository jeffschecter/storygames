There was wisdom in this, and it reshaped how I make my particular strengths, now. I told Brendan that he didn't have to come up with his particular strength until he felt it for his character, he agreed, and we moved on. I continued with my NPCs making and binding them to the characters and giving them 'typical' strengths (typical for me - powers and such).<br/><br/>Then Brendan rocked my world.<br/><br/>"Can my particular strength be Murder? And have it be unique?"<br/><br/>H<br/>O<br/>L<br/>Y<br/><br/>S<br/>C<br/>H<br/>N<br/>I<br/>K<br/>I<br/>E<br/>S<br/>!<br/><br/>This radically changed the game. Reworking our fictional world so that Brendan's character was the only one that murdered, well, damn, it was intense and made the game for me.<br/><br/>The moral? Particular Strengths aren't just cool powers. They can define the game, when used with innovation.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/willem" title="willem"><img alt="willem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/willem">willem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137937/#Comment_137937" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T12:33:55+00:00" title="April  3, 2008 12:33PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            totally amazing and insane. i love it.
