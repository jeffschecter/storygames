We all had a chance to run things, figure out our strengths and weaknesses in GMing, and got to learn from the strengths and weaknesses of everyone else's GMing style. It is, though, probably something that should be given some thought, as I notice more adults getting into RPGs later, and sometimes have to start from scratch.<br/>If anything, I'd say make sure the players, up front, know that you're trying to improve your GMing ability, and would appreciate feedback or maybe even helpful hints in-game to make things run more smoothly. And maybe start with simpler games or ones with very defined structures, and then work up to ones that are more complex or offer a lot more GM control and improvisation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325865/#Comment_325865" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T10:58:06+00:00" title="May 23, 2011 10:58AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To put it plainly, make sure GMing isn't the only thing you do with them.

Because, for me, it's been a very fruitful learning experience trying out a bunch of new techniques for running the sandbox-y sorts of games I aspired to (but mostly failed to produce) playing Rifts and In Nomine in my youth.  It's definitely not my best GMing work, by far, but thankfully AW gives you enough tools and support that it still works out pretty well even though I'm kinda faking my way through an unfamiliar set of GM techniques.  Are the players mostly being tolerant or is it actually fun?  Probably some of both, I reckon.<br/><br/>In my experience, most roleplayers who are not John Harper will put up with a lot of mediocre-to-terrible play before they would choose to stop playing.  One of the things I really admire about John, having played with him in a few games now, is that he's not afraid to call out when things don't seem to be working after a few sessions and suggest moving on to something else, often with a different mix of people.  And there's no real judgment or blame thrown around. You just move on and look forward to playing the next game.<br/><br/>And, honestly, maybe that's best when things aren't working.  Sometimes you can learn to be a better GM thought poor experiences, but often you need some time between those experience to reflect on what you've learned, internalize it, and enjoy playing games that you're actually good at running.  Because it's not like GMing is some kind of universal set of techniques -- despite what all those 1990s games and GM handbooks tried to tell us -- and if you only play games that you're not that good at running, that sounds like an easy way to get burnt out and decide you don't really like GMing very much.<br/><br/>So, yeah, the best way is probably to keep trying new stuff regularly, learning and growing and pushing yourselves, but also enjoy playing stuff that you know will be awesome.  Personally, I'm always ready to fall back on The Mountain Witch or Bliss Stage or Dogs in the Vineyard as indie games that I know I can make work under nearly any circumstances, as long as the players are engaged. You can't be pushing yourself all the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325872/#Comment_325872" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T11:14:29+00:00" title="May 23, 2011 11:14AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>Jason Corley over on the comics thread said that it's fun and valuable to learn to GM - and sure - but isn't the main way to learn to do things through practice?

It's not like public speaking or political debates - its supposed to be people having fun. If, instead, you're dealing with people who don't know you too well...then that could be kinda awkward, and it probably would look better to seem like you had a strong GM presence.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>What are the best games to learn to GM with?</blockquote>\nThat, I think, will depend on the individual. Back in the day, I really got a handle of GMing with Call of Cthulhu, AD&amp;D 2E, and Mekton. When I got to college, I learned how to improvise and run things fast with Feng Shui. But, of course, there was a bit of a learning curve for all of these. If I had to start over, I'd go with DangerPatrol (since the players build the adventure as much as the GM), Dungeon Slayers (since it is rules-lite and doesn't force the GM to keep track of far too many details), and...well...I'd still probably go with Feng Shui. And then I'd try to work my way up to Apocalypse World and octaNe. But again, that's me. I'd say any game where you can read and understand the rules fairly easily, so you don't have to keep referencing a book or three, and holds your interest and captures your imagination, would be a good start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325890/#Comment_325890" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T12:09:28+00:00" title="May 23, 2011 12:09PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like Judd: "Talk to each other."<br/><br/>Really, lots of communication can help with this.

You could also consider running a Trail of Cthulhu module. Probably harder than a dungeon crawl but their modules are excellent. <br/><br/>Start small. Aim for a single 4 hour session with 3-4 players and pre-generated characters. Low commitment, low pressure. Burning Wheel scenarios are excellent examples of perfectly timed convention games: <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/wiki/index.php?title=Downloads#Scenarios_and_Demos" rel="nofollow">http://www.burningwheel.org/wiki/index.php?title=Downloads#Scenarios_and_Demos</a><br/><br/>I was a terrible GM for many years. Playing with the same group of people didn't improve my skills. Instead I strived to play with as many different people and different games as I could. I started as a player and tried to observe as many GMs as I could. Absorbing everything I could from Luke Crane was a game changer. He's a very skilled convention GM who learned how to do more with less. The above scenarios may give you a peak into his brilliant head!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325912/#Comment_325912" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T13:36:39+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  1:36PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This may sound weird\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a few friends who did all of the above and still felt stuck GM wise.

Openness is a very valuable trait for a facilitator, though if you're running games for strangers with no previous experience, that muddies things a bit, and makes public speaking skills more important.<br/><br/>One game I'd recommend for learning to gamemaster is Mouse Guard.  It gives you very simple procedures for gamemastering, and if you practice those and get good at them, you will find yourself using them over and over again elsewhere.<br/><br/>If you know you are going to run a game for strangers or inexperienced players, then practice your pitch and your explanation of the rules.  This is the place where public speaking skills <i>can</i> be really important. Gamemastering is always easiest if the players come into the game excited about playing. If your explanation of what the game is about and why it's fun is weak, slow, rambling, etc, that excitement and energy is going to dissipate.  Similarly, if your explanation of the rules is boring and takes you a long time, the players will start losing enthusiasm.  They will also be less likely to actually understand the rules, which means you're going be stopping play for momentum-killing rules explanations during the session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325929/#Comment_325929" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T14:27:12+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  2:27PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2011 2:29PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is, of course, a huge topic. But I want to roll off of a couple of posts:<br/><br/>I have found:<br/>- Listening<br/>- Going Slower<br/><br/>...to be helpful to a huge degree as a Game Master.<br/><br/>Oh. I also took the the whole connotation of the term "Game Master" out to the back yard and shot it twice in the head. I'm pretty sure we're stuck with that ugly, unfortunate term for all time to come. But the following has become my default (and only apply to my approach, so there's no big argument to be had):<br/><br/>- the things I play these days aren't "games." <i>Sorcerer</i> or <i>Hero Wars</i> or <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> or whatever, each is toy we play with socially. Or, another metaphor, tools or instruments, like playing a piano in a duet.<br/>- I am "master" of nothing. I'm a fellow player, a peer, playing on the same team as the Players. I have a different function than the Players, the way a first baseman has a different function than a pitcher... but we're playing <i>together</i>.<br/><br/>The whole notion that I'm supposed to know everything, unlock the wonders of creativity for the Players and somehow be the Inception device that the Players can plug into is nowhere to be found.<br/><br/>Which leads to a corollary proposition: that the Players better show up to play as well. They better want there to play <i>this</i> game with <i>these</i> people at <i>this</i> time. They have to bring the fun to the table to, to invest in jiggering solutions if the game gets snagged, to create characters they fucking care about investing in situations they care about. They have to be ready to help build the fiction as anyone else would in a creative endeavor. Again, they do it from a different role than the Game Master -- they're only playing their character. But they better be there to play the fuck out of that character with passion and investment. If things are slowing for them,they have to be willing to speak up and say, "I'm going to need more here," or push harder into the narrative or <i>something</i>.<br/><br/>This isn't a one way street, in other words.

I know this leads to me having more fun, and I'm pretty sure my players do too.<br/><br/>It might be extreme to say that all problems people have as players and GMs are problems with their psychology, but there are sure lots of things that come up in gaming that can bring out those kinds of patterns - e.g. GMing tends to be surrounded by narcissistic fantasies about having power and control, but also being dependent on others to give that to you, so that you're alternating between ego trips and disappointed rage that your genius is wasted on swine. <br/><br/>Getting my head a little more straightened out about this stuff made it possible for me to understand &amp; embrace the kind of right-on indie ideas that Mr. Kubasik is dropping above, or the really old-school ideas of being a Referee and a neutral arbiter of oracular dice and player input rather than the johnnie-come-lately trad notion of the Dungeon Master. So yeah there's technical things I can point to and say "these made me a better GM" but without therapy to work on the psychology behind 'em I don't think I would have been able to pick up those tools.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325948/#Comment_325948" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T15:33:49+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  3:33PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great observations Tavis!

And that's true, FINE, but there are similar skills that are used across many games.  A dungeon crawl will teach you the following:<br/><br/>* How hard players will slam against walls and still have fun.<br/>* The pacing of rewards they desire.<br/>* How much luck/bad luck they will tolerate, how much you will tolerate.<br/>* How decisions are made amongst this group of players.<br/>* Physical descriptions of surroundings.<br/>* Tactical stuff like moving enemies around and fighting the PCs.<br/><br/>All of these are relevant to many, many, many, many, many other games.<br/><br/>I would also recommend Call of Cthulhu for many of the same reasons.  If you're a noob GM, there's no reason you need to knock yourself out trying to do everything yourself, when there's plenty of people willing to sell you the pre-made pieces until you're ready to do it all yourself.<br/><br/>But it sounds like you're already past this point and have a clear idea of what you want to do? I guess I don't get what the question is then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325957/#Comment_325957" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T15:59:30+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  3:59PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Expectations is probably part of it.

I'd do this even if the answers were completely obvious to me, and I kept focusing on those questions until we had consensus about stakes and risks.<br/><br/>The ritual gives you something to directly refer to when you get to the friendly feedback phase.

And saying "what do I(we) want more of?" is good for helping make *play* better.  But I'm not sure how well it helps hone GMing, especially in the nebulous newbie phase.  I might be that you're really good at characterization, but your plots are transparent.  Your players want more cool characterization, but that's not likely to help much with your plots.  It might also be that your players are all badass and all they need is for you to stay out of their way.  Again, good gameplay, not helpful to improve your GMing.  Some general feedback, or even "what's working well?" won't help much.  Something like what Johnzo's suggesting, where you focus on some aspect/technique/theme, then try to get specific feedback about it seems like it's needed to make feedback useful.<br/><br/>     I read (listened to) Talent is Overrated a while back, which plays up the idea of Deliberate Practice.  One of the things that helps is having tasks just at the edge of your ability, <i>designed by a coach</i> to push you.  A lot of indie/story games implicitly do that.  But it might be cool to have a sort of gamers handbook with specific exercises, checklists, and feedback suggestions in addition to the discussions of techniques.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326005/#Comment_326005" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T18:32:02+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  6:32PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2011 6:37PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cy, your points are well taken.<br/><br/>In fact, in <i>Play Sorcerer</i> there will be a few exercises.

Thirty-three years in, I still have a lot to learn as a GM.  I know plenty of people who are better actors and who are easily more spontaneous and creative than I am, but I still judge some of them no better than I am at GM'ing because they're poor organizers/facilitators/rules-explainers.  This is especially important when facilitating a game for new players who've not read the rules prior to the session.  I judge my years as a boardgame host and as a manager (former) to be better training for GM'ing than even the long-form improv I used to do.<br/><br/>The good news, Jaimie, is I'd wager you're a fine GM based on the little I've seen and there are a dozen other reasons why your indie night turnout might be dropping off recently.  The bad news is that there are few short-cuts or silver bullets for improving your craft AND <i>GM-less/ful games take no less skill at facilitating than GM'd games.</i>  Just different skills.  You can totally screw up facilitating a GM-less/ful game!  Yea!<br/><br/>Although I am not great at following this advice, the stuff about energy and enthusiasm is golden and is something which is easily implemented w/o years of practice.  This plus being willing to to play unsafe will smooth over a hundred other deficiencies.

It's not a question of IF players find a clue it's how much do they need to sacrifice to get it.<br/><br/>2 When you ask question's the player's answer should always progresses the story. if you ask something like "where do you think the killer is hiding?" The group should choose where to go and either find the killer or find something that leads them to the killer's location regardless of what you may have plained. In fact don't plan specifics like that. The written outline of your procedure, along with setting materials should be enough.<br/><br/>did any of that stick?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326227/#Comment_326227" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T18:38:04+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  6:38PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know a secret... a lot of game designers became designers because they weren't good GMs!

(I'm doing this with the <i>Hero Wars</i> rules right now.)<br/><br/>A lot of game texts are not that clear, with rules and exceptions and subsystems all over the book. Moreover, how the pieces of the game fit together to impact each other and/or produce certain results in play is not always explicit. <br/><br/>By laying out the process of how one makes characters leading into how one makes setting (or vice versa), which leads into how one settles conflicts and so on, I get a good idea of how the pieces feed each other and the gears mesh. My putting the game elements in my own process of translation, I make it mine to understand.<br/><br/>I tend to type this all out, building a set of steps for myself, so I know how I'm going to play the game and how I'm going to walk the Players through the steps of play when different aspects of play show up.<br/><br/>It also means that when I find portions of the game that don't make sense to me or I don't understand how they fit with other pieces, I have to sit there and struggle with them. If I'm building a kind of Flowchart of Understanding the Game and I really don't see how or where one element goes, it usually means I misread something, or didn't read it clearly, or don't see yet how it <i>does</i> actually mesh with the other gears of the game. By having to figure out where to put it in the process of play, I tend to sort out how it actually does fit in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326414/#Comment_326414" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T20:56:19+00:00" title="May 25, 2011  8:56PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll add another benefit of this:<br/><br/>So, over at RPG.net I was involved with some great folks about <i>HeroQuest 2</i>. It was a great thread, and really helpful, with everyone, contra the Internet, being really great together.<br/><br/>Anyway... When I started reading <i>HeroQuest 2</i> when it was first published, there were all sorts of alarm bells that went off for me. Specifically about Robin Laws' focus on Success and Failure primary structure of building stories. I eventually started skimming the rules, because I could just <i>tell</i> that it really wasn't a game for me.<br/><br/>But the truth was, if you had put a gun to my head and said, "Justify your position!" my brains and blood and little shards of bone would have ended up on the wall. Because the truth is I hadn't done the work to know really why I was getting so turned off. Not that it's my job to do that work, mind you. I have enough to do already. But still, I didn't really know.<br/><br/>So, as I was rummaging through <i>Hero Wars</i>, I thought I'd take a look at <i>HeroQuest 2</i> again, because what the heck. It's got a decade of thought on top of it since <i>Hero Wars</i>. Maybe I was missing something. Maybe the game was the right one to use instead of <i>Hero Wars</i>.<br/><br/>My rummaging led me to the thread on RPG.net, and the folks there answered a bunch of questions I had, and clarified some of the text for me. And this, in turn, sent me back into the text to read it more clearly. And I began to see how the rules and the text formed little gears that reinforced each other in play and I began to get a better handle on exactly what Laws had built. And then, armed with this understanding, I asked more questions on the thread, about how actual play works out for these folks when using <i>HeroQuest 2</i>, in regard to a few elements of play that would either confirm or deny what I think the rules did. And the answers confirmed what I was thinking.<br/><br/>What all this did was let me see, specifically, how my instincts were right. But now I had taken the gears apart and laid them out on the table and saw how the teeth fit together into a game I really would not want to play. Because what Laws wants for fun isn't my idea of fun. And he built his fun pretty specifically into <i>HeroQuest 2.</i><br/><br/>My point is, that by doing this work of really sorting out the process of play, rule-by-rule, chart-by-chart, I was able to say, "Okay, this game is about <i>this</i>, and that is not something I really want to do."<br/><br/>That's valuable! I think at least. All these games are doing all these different things. And some of those things might not be things that actually turn you on once you open them up and take a look inside. <br/><br/>In my view, to Game Master these games means boring down to the gear-interlocking level of understanding where you can make a judgment about whether you even want to play it or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
