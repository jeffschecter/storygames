I'm gearing up for session 2 of Apocalypse world, and I'm doing a bit of a time skip. After setting and char creation during session 1, I gave the players a little bit of intro to the system by splitting them up into small groups and letting their natural curiosity and the dice pave the way for plot.<br/><br/>Well, now I got a lot of fodder, and I've got a 2 month time skip on my hand, so I figured I should give the Love Letters a spin. However, I've never done anything like this before, so I would appreciate it if some folk could take a look at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lCeafuzWreO4J1lscZZKni-Q0904B7dTZ69hP0OdVDg/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">what I wrote up</a> and let me know if there is some egregious mistake I made. I'm a little worried about some of my custom moves, so I'd love to know if they're too harsh or too weak.<br/><br/>p.s. I put it on a google doc cause they're a bit long.<br/><br/>Now, on to my real question that I'm more concerned about... Acting Under Fire. Specifically the 7-9 roll results.  I get the concept behind this mechanic: It's a partial success. Sure they get the big thing they were after (i need to escape, I need to grab the mcguffin while running through suppressing fire).... but then I put them in a spot or give them a hard choice.. and.. well it stops feeling like a partial success. As one of my players put it, it felt more like partial failures more often than not.<br/><br/>This is a pretty valid concern.  By way of example, let me tell you of a particular roll that stands out in my mind.<br/><br/>Savyhead is trying to escape from a trap set by some douchebag wastelanders.  They exploded a small garage around her, pinning her  under rubble, and opened fire on her partner out front in the getaway car.<br/><br/>She crawled out from under the rubble and sees the inside is on fire and structurally weak. She hears the gunshots from out front, so she starts hightailing it through the fire and damaged building to get out the back.  Alright, Acting under Fire.. very literally.  She gets an 8.<br/><br/>Here's my thinking: Well her goal is to get out of this building and find a backdoor escape route. So, that's absolutely going to happen, partial success after all.  However, she's in this mess cause she's looking for some Components for her McGuffin machine she's building. She came to this garage first, because it was one of 3 likely spots where the components might be found. Here's where I fuck up.  I tell her:<br/><br/>"Ok, you pick your way through the rubble and do some rad parkouring to find a backdoor to this deathtrap.  However, before you bolt out the door you spy the Components you were looking for. They're stacked haphazardly on-top of some excavating equipment. Now, you know it's trapped. You can see that it's rigged and there's an open window that faces it.. most likely they have people posted looking for any survivors.  All this to say, if the trap doesnt hit you, the guys keeping watch outside the building will.... provided you go after the components.  So here's your tough choice.  Leave now, scott free, and live to fight another day. OR make a quick 20 second detour and suffer the trap/gun-fire, grab the Components, and make it out the door.. all in one go. If you can weather the damage, you'll be able to get outside and get your Components."<br/><br/>So... afterwards, talking to the players, they thought it felt like a failure.  And here's why. They thought this was the only chance to achieve mission success.  IF she chose to just run, they were under the impression that they could not find any other viable components in this town.<br/><br/>I was under no such impression myself, and I think where I really failed was in not telling the player this is just a missed opportunity, not a complete mission failure. Had she chosen to just flee she was welcome to keep scrounging through the town, albeit while battling these wasteland savages.<br/><br/>My question, any tips or advice on how to NOT make 7-9s feel like failures? Obviously I'm struggling with this the most on Acting Under Fire. Most of the other moves have lists or options the players pick from, so it's pretty easy to adjudicate those situations.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449899/#Comment_449899" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-04T20:28:01+00:00" title="December  4, 2015  8:28PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My impression here is that your 7-9 call was totally "legit", in the sense that it is what I would expect in a game of Apocalypse World. "There are no status quos", "look through crosshairs", and all that: this is how it goes. Furthermore, the "acting under fire" is not really a positive, effective move: generally speaking (as in this case), when you're rolling that, you're not the one in control, and things aren't going to go well for you unless you get really lucky and roll a 10+. <br/><br/>That's how Apocalypse World works; compare with other moves and you'll see that they position you much more strongly. (For instance, a 7-9 on a "go aggro" move is generally a pretty good position to be in.) When you're making strong, proactive moves (and especially playbook moves), you're very effective. When you're acting under fire, chances are you're not in control and you'll be lucky to get out in one piece (as in your example). This is the nature of Apocalypse World, and one of the statements the rules make about the "World" and what life in it is like.<br/><br/>If you compare with other moves' 7-9 results, you'll see that they often feel pretty rough - but the point is that, yeah, you got what you wanted (in this case, to get out in one piece, which, given a collapsed, trapped, burning building and surrounded by enemies, is really an incredible success). That's fine.<br/><br/>What seems to be the issue here, rather, is the players' expectations. What's all this about "mission success"? Remember, there are no status quos - nothing's a given, nothing is safe, nothing is guaranteed. So you lost your Components - even if they're irreplaceable - well, that's how it goes. Better get your revenge on, or make a new plan, or run far, far away. That's Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>As far as them not realizing that the Components are replaceable, I'd recommend that you get familiar, as a group, with asking about this kind of thing. ("I have to choose between leaving without the Components, or getting shot up? Man, that's tough. Ok, before I choose, I have a question: if they are lost for good, what are my chances of replacing them with something else?") After all, the Apocalypse World doesn't have a sourcebook detailing this stuff: you're all making it up as you go along. That's very much the sort of thing you'll want to ask each other about (and you could even turn the question on the player, and see what they say).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449900/#Comment_449900" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-04T20:49:23+00:00" title="December  4, 2015  8:49PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2015 8:55PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Further thoughts:<br/><br/>1. Your application of the acting under fire move seems very good to me, nothing unfair about it. However, it's possible that the *situation* itself might have felt unfair.<br/><br/>If I'm watching a movie and that happens, I'd be thinking:<br/><br/>a) Oh, man! That character really got lucky, getting out of there alive and unscathed! Wow!<br/>(In other words, they were definitely *successful* in this case. Surviving against overwhelming odds!)<br/><br/>But also:<br/><br/>b) Wow! That character really got the short end of the stick, with this brutal assault in their own home. Sucks to be them! Life is not fair to the poor [character].<br/><br/>So, if I were looking for "unfairness" (if that's even an issue in Apocalypse World - but that's on the group to navigate; I generally get the vibe from the text and from typical post-apocalyptic fiction that really, really bad things happen a LOT, and often for no good reason, so I expect that), I'd look at how this whole situation was set up. Did you offer up enough "soft moves" to allow the player to reposition him- or her-self to deal with this crisis, or did they feel like they were ambushed with no chance to do anything about it?<br/><br/>They might legitimately feel that losing their components due to a sudden and surprise attack with no forewarning is really harsh. Just like saying, "Rocks fall and you all die", it's not a "fair" MC move because it's too hard - it should usually be set up with soft moves first, or you risk violating "being a fan of the characters".<br/><br/>It's not the "acting under fire" which is causing them to lose the components, it's the situation where their own home has been trapped and they're caught off-guard by an overwhelmingly strong enemy. The resolution via the act under fire move isn't an unfair resolution of this disastrous attack; it's the attack itself which could have been overly heavy-handed. (Although I'd imagine it's plenty welcome in lots of people's AW games.)<br/><br/>2. The Love Letters look good to me, I don't have an issue with their "harshness", except for the following comments:<br/><br/>* Generally, the MC's job is to disclaim decision-making a lot to the dice, and let things unfold as they do. However, Love Letters are a bit different, because you dictate the details of *everything* that goes on, without any input from the players. For this reason, unlike in "normal" play, you'll want to check the characters' stats and adjust your moves accordingly. If a character has a really high stat, you can make the move "more scary", and vice-versa.<br/><br/>For instance, if I were the Hardholder and my cool was -2 (if I remember correctly, the Hardholder's love letter is a roll+cool), I'd feel pretty put upon by that Love Letter. Because that just seems like adding insult to injury; you've set me up with a pretty punishing move AND you're deciding that my odds of any kind of success are really low. A double-whammy. Give me a chance, will ya?<br/><br/>* Some of the Letters are very negative and some are very positive. I could see some players getting annoyed at that ("How come Bobby got such a *nice* letter, and I didn't???") - although, I think, it's the nature of Apocalypse World, and no different from any other MC moves, which are NOT about fairness. However, maybe do a self-check and see if they flow naturally from the fiction and don't feel like a sudden reversal coming out of nowhere.<br/><br/>* Most of the moves include a lot of very specific fictional content, even though much of it probably won't see play. This might be a personal preference, but that seems sub-optimal to me. First of all, I wouldn't want to waste time writing so much stuff only then to have it never appear in play. Second, the players are going to read it all, and then they're going to have to remember that it didn't really happen - to forget what they read, effectively. That's kind of backwards, I think.<br/><br/>So I generally try to write Love Letters so that the information about the fictional situation is true anyway, and applies to play no matter what. This way, writing it (and the players reading it) isn't a waste of effort for anyone. <br/><br/>It's just some of the *details* of what's going down which are settled by the move itself. If I have lots of detail, it'll go in the "main text" of the Letter, and the optional results will be as brief as possible (e.g. "Here's a bunch of information about the fire-bombing and its repercussions. Now roll to see if so-and-so survived and how likely the Gate is to collapse in the next week" -&gt; but we know for sure that so-and-so was involved and badly burned, as well as that the Gate is now in rough shape, that's not in question.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli" title="Luzelli"><img alt="Luzelli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli">Luzelli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449901/#Comment_449901" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-04T21:30:38+00:00" title="December  4, 2015  9:30PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> Oh man, that's a lot of good feedback. Let me try and tackle this piecemeal.<br/>1) The Savyhead and the Driver were out exploring a ruined town surface side. While this doesn't excuse the situation, I just wanted to clarify that they didn't have their home-base jacked up. The trap triggered on a completely failed Act under Fire roll. I tried to telegraph, got the Driver to read a sitch, but wasn't able to get the Savyhead to do the same. Still, I agree that I should be more careful and really make sure I telegraph an ambush hard.<br/><br/>2) Good point about the Love Letters. Truth be told, I just kinda had a lot of fun writing in-voice, but I may have gone overboard with it. As for Stats, I intentionally avoided using their best stats to roll, but I also didn't use their worst. For example, the hardholder you mentioned has a +1 to cool, so I used that stat. Basically I was trying to avoid any -'ve stats and any +2 or 3 stats.  Good, bad, flawed? Since the letters are so thoroughly in my control, should I reconsider and key them off a character's best stats? I would love to hear people's thoughts on how they decide which stats to key a love letter roll on. This was actually a long debate for me.<br/><br/>3) I like the idea of setting up some fiction that is happening no matter what: The Gate is ruined, the people are unruly, and Brain is dissatisfied. Then having the roll say, "Ok, which of these are immediate problems that must be attended to right now. If I understand your post correctly, you seem to be suggesting the roll be used to set-up a priority list, rather than completely alter the fiction based on results.<br/><br/>I was approaching it with the idea that, Players will roll to dictate what is now cannon in fiction. But perhaps the better way to deal with it is to say: the roll determines what of the established fiction is most pressing at this moment.<br/><br/>4) As far as making some of the letters bad and some good, I was doing that intentionally to just play with the format. See how the letters track on both sides of the coin. Basically, how does it feel when one person is determining what complication the group must deal with, while another is determining what bonuses/advantages the group has a chance to pursue. However, I really couldn't think of too many good options, so only one letter really reflects that.<br/><br/>5) My other goals with the letters were as follows: I run this game every other week, so I was trying to use them as a way to remind players of what plot happened that's relevant to them. As a corollary to this, I was also trying to reiterate what NPCs they've made important while also adding a couple more into the mix. Finally, I wanted to use the letters to allow them to dictate the flow of the rest of the next sessions. If a player decided to pursue a job for the local doctor, then I would work to make that NPC more notable. Is there a better usage for the letters that I'm missing? Any other way I can use them to greater effect? Open to any and all suggestions here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449903/#Comment_449903" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-04T22:48:46+00:00" title="December  4, 2015 10:48PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2015 10:52PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad you got something useful out of my rambling. I don't have too much else to add, but I'll say that your understanding of love letters and what they're for matches mine pretty much exactly. All of that sounds good to me!<br/><br/>I don't *know* if you failed to telegraph anything or not in your "trapped house" scenario - and, besides, with some groups you wouldn't even be expected to (which is a totally legit and fun way to play AW, I think, and very in-genre). I was just thinking about possibilities here - it's up to you to find out (or ask) which is the case with your group.<br/><br/>I don't have any better answers than you for which stats to choose or how to choose - that's a kind of funny point in love letter design, since the game was not originally built to interface with love letters (the choice of stats in a love letter is pretty arbitrary, after all).<br/><br/>I look at it like this, myself:<br/><br/>* Pick something that makes sense, but also be sure to look at the odds and design your love letter move (if it even is a diced move - love letters don't have to involve rolling at all!) accordingly. I think a +2 roll in a love letter is just fine; but you'll want to be aware of that so you can make sure your positive results aren't boring, since they'll be more likely to pop up.<br/><br/>I think some of the existing playbooks work this way already: a hardholder's Wealth move is pretty punishing stuff, in a way, but it's designed with characters rolling at +2 in mind, so those two pieces of the puzzle fit together. You wouldn't want to play a hardholder with a -2 hard.<br/><br/>* I like to design love letter moves with player choices instead of straight up stats sometimes. <br/><br/>"Roll two dice, and add 1 if you spent a bunch of scratch on bribing the Crawlers since the incident (subtract 3-barter), and add 1 if you sent away your main lieutenant into the Wastes."<br/><br/>The player can now choose to improve their odds at a cost (their lieutenant's not around to deal with the fallout); that seems more interesting to me than picking a stat arbitrarily if the roll is really all about events that are out of the control of the PC anyway.<br/><br/>Your ideas about the players deciding which elements of play they want to "make canon" or explore are great. I just think that, from a practical point of view, you want to limit the ink spilled on items which potentially won't ever enter play.<br/><br/>It's more efficient, it feels less distruptive, and the players don't have to remember that something they read isn't at all true.<br/><br/>I can usually find a way to rephrase things so that the roll establishes an important circumstance without my having to write a paragraph about it *first*.<br/><br/>Here's an example:\n<blockquote><br/>Dremmer, unbeknownst to you, the one-eyed healer woman has decided to get out of here while you're asleep in her care. She's taken the satellite uplink widget you have been jealously guarding and is heading across the Wastes to deliver it into the hands of the Red Jaws. Roll+sharp:<br/><br/>On a 10+, something woke you up in time, and you catch her out in front of the Sheds at dawn. <br/><br/>On a 7-9, she's gone but not too long ago: you can still see her tracks leading out into the sand.<br/><br/>On a miss, she's long gone; you could give chase, but finding her before she reaches the Red Jaws would be a miracle.<br/><br/>Now: what alerted you to her departure? Choose one.<br/><br/>* It was the psychic maelstrom itself, for some strange reason. Roll to open your brain as the session opens. <br/>* It was your pal Toyota. Tell him to mark +1Hx with you, but this also means at some point you told him about the widget, so now he knows.<br/></blockquote>\nYou can very easily imagine, I hope, how in the original version of this letter, I might have had much more detail in the text of each possible entry, descriptive detail, that kind of thing, but I slimmed it down and put as much of it as I could in the first paragraph. <br/><br/>I don't need to add descriptive detail to the outcomes: if the player catches her out in the open I can describe the scene *then*. (I could make notes for myself if I need, of course, but no point printing them out for the player to read when we're going to end up playing it out anyway if that's the result that comes up.)<br/><br/>I find that more efficient, for me and for the player.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449904/#Comment_449904" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-04T23:16:33+00:00" title="December  4, 2015 11:16PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>That Act Under Fire looks 100% fine to me; my only suggestion would be to be more clear about the consequences of the more dangerous option (is it another roll? is it taking harm?) An ideal hard choice either resolves the current situation with clear consequences -- e.g. 'you can grab the components but you will take 3 harm from the trap/gunfire' -- or escalates the current situation by radically changing the fiction; e.g. 'you can save the components but you'll be at the mercy of the raiders'. So a version where it's like 'you can grab the components but then make ANOTHER act under fire roll to see what happens with the fire I have already described' would be less good, but it's not clear to me if that was what you were going for.<br/><br/>But either way, it's fine. As Paul pointed out, the issue seems to be player expectations. AW is not fair and there are no 'missions' other than those in their fool heads. At the same time, there is no One Thing they need, or One Solution they can screw up. 'No status quo' is as generous to the player characters as it is cruel, depending on how they feel about the current state of affairs.<br/><br/>As for the love letters. The hardholder letter strikes me as extremely excessive. 'Here, add up to THREE NEW TOTALLY FICTIONALLY DISTINCT PROBLEMS with your hardhold -- which by the way <i>already has existing problems that we probably haven't explored yet much at all</i>.' Think about the miss condition here -- is it actually more interesting or exciting or at all different from the 7-9 or even 10+? It's just more of the same, and not really in an interesting way because you have designed the options to be stand-alone situations. Yes, sure, three different bad things at once is a different situation than one bad thing, but there's no escalation or clear connection between the problems. <br/><br/>And most importantly, resolving each of these situations is going to require moves and new NPC faces and <i>time</i>. Like actual player group time. Screen time for the Hardholder, whose player might have actually had some other ideas of things they wanted to do with the character, or aspects of their hold they wanted to explore.<br/><br/>To generalize to a rule, a love letter should create or elaborate on one fictional situation, and it should give the player some choice as to what aspects of that situation are interesting. So coming up with a few things that could be wrong is fine, but having an option where they choose up to 3 of them is overkill. Having them choose between troublesome aspects of a single situation would be stronger, since then choosing multiples will escalate the situation without necessarily making it take longer to resolve. <br/><br/>Crap example: 'Oh no, there's a psychic plague in your hardhold! Roll and choose:<br/><br/>* There's no obvious treatment.<br/>* Everybody knows about it and they're freaking out.<br/>* The spirits of the recent dead are involved.<br/>* You're infected.'<br/><br/>But the main problem with your love letter to the Hardholder is that instead of doubling down on what they've established about their hold, you invented a bunch of new problems instead. The 4th choice should be THE choice -- they should be activating the existing wants. You've only played one session! You don't need to invent new problems for the Hardhold, you need to elaborate on what is already there. Because what is already there is what the Hardholder's player decided was cool. They didn't choose Famine. They didn't choose Decay. They chose... some other stuff. So start with that. Start with the obvious things that go wrong, because presumably after one session you haven't really seen how that works yet, anyways.<br/><br/>Now it looks like fictionally you are already doing this, to some degree -- each of the choices seems to be tied into something that has happened or been discussed, or at least that's my assumption. So possibly this suggestion is less crucial. But I still think that, mechanically, you should stick close to the Wants that are already present.<br/><br/>Reading the other letters, I think I'd just repeat my advice above. These things are nutso long, and there's like six different situations in every single one, plus questions. You don't need this much stuff! I mean, YOU do, the MC, it's good to have all these possibilities percolating in your head, in case things slow down, but you don't need to put it all out there at once, right now. I look at these letters and I am like 'I hope literally 100% of the rolls result in 1 choice' because otherwise you are basically just going to be stepping on your own toes, and unnecessarily crowding the fiction before the session has even started.<br/><br/>I mean in general I kind of think love letters are a trap, especially for new MCs, so I guess take this with a grain of salt. In this case, jumping ahead in time, it's more justifiable to use them, but you have to avoid using them to like, blueprint the entire next six sessions worth of gameplay. They're letters, not manifestos, not directives -- they're like 'hey, I'm the MC, and I was curious about <i>this one little thing</i>, so I made up a move or thought of some stuff about <i>just exactly that one thing</i>, why don't you tell me how it went/what you think?' Yes, of course, the 'little' and 'just' are kind of ironic, because hopefully the thing you thought of is potentially explosive, but it's still true that it's only one thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449905/#Comment_449905" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-05T00:30:07+00:00" title="December  5, 2015 12:30AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2015 12:32AM by Paul_T.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (That's a great point.

First off, due to crazy RL adventures, I had to pull the trigger on the AW game a lot sooner than I thought. So, I never had a chance to show you folk how I amended the letters to suit your feed back.\n<blockquote><br/>As for the love letters. The hardholder letter strikes me as extremely excessive... Think about the miss condition here -- is it actually more interesting or exciting or at all different from the 7-9 or even 10+? It's just more of the same...<br/><br/>To generalize to a rule, a love letter should create or elaborate on one fictional situation, and it should give the player some choice as to what aspects of that situation are interesting... Having them choose between troublesome aspects of a single situation would be stronger, since then choosing multiples will escalate the situation without necessarily making it take longer to resolve.</blockquote>\nThis was excellent! Really put the whole concept of love letters into a stronger light for me. You're totally right. They were excessively long. Which is one of the big things I was worried about.  But even more so, I was nervous about introducing so many different plot threads at once. Yes, they are all derived from the fiction of the first game. Which was crazy, and generated everyone of these situations. Buuuut, that sure would have been a lot of balls to juggle all at once.<br/><br/>In taking your advice, I slimmed down the letters, and re-sliced them with the prominent idea, "what one situation is most important/exciting to resolve." Then i went back and added onto it like you suggested. Soo, instead of a miss generating 2 to 3 more plot points, they made one particular situation more dire.  After you mentioned it, I went back and looked at the various love letter examples I liked and I realized they all just escalate the one fictional situation. I had been approaching it from the concept of.. use a love letter to let the players pick their poison, fictionally. But, without tempering it and saying, but it's only the degree of horror in one poison, I spiraled it out to multiple new situations.\n<blockquote><br/>As a sidenote about the 7-9 result: my interpretation, based on what you'd written, was essentially that taking the Components would result in taking harm as established (anything too far from that would catch me by surprise). So I may have read it differently than IceCreamEmperor!</blockquote>\nYeah, that's exactly how it went. I may have summarized the situation a bit confusingly. At the end of the day, the choice was: Take harm as established and get out w/ goods in hand OR escape free of harm and have to hunt down your Components elsewhere. <br/><br/>I'm glad you all think the 7-9 was handled well.. my nagging doubt is still in presentation. I suspect any rational person will look at 7-9 Under Fire and see it for what it is: complication generation. However, I'm a big proponent of trying to play towards the Player Psychology, and that's where I think I failed. Do you folk consider that when levying 7-9s on Under Fire? By way of overly lengthy explanation....<br/><br/>I know one of the reasons my players buckled under Blades is that they felt all the partials were partial failures instead of partial successes. No matter how I spun it, they still looked at it as getting fucked instead of as slight hiccup in your plans. I can't tell you how many times I head someone say, "Yeah, but I got a 4 [or 5] on my roll, how is that still a partial?" <br/><br/>For that reason, I'm trying hard to present these 7-9s as "OMG this is totally awesome!!!!!!@!@!@! oh yeah, but there is this one thing... should be okay though." Is this something you folk do? Or is there just an understanding at the table that 7-9s are partials as a vehicle to expand on the plot.  It's possible I'm fighting an uphill battle by trying to present everything as a SUPER SUCCESS and this one tiny flaw/choice.  Maybe it's best I just level with them and say, "Sorry, them's the breaks. The world is cruel and unusual." However, if you do generally opt to try and spin it as great success with a niggling complication, does anyone have any tips or methods on that? I realize that's a super vague/highly circumstantial question... <br/><br/>Right now, if I were to summarize my current method it would be: Highlight what's good. Highlight how this gets them what they want in either event. But throw in a monkey wrench and let them know they can pick what they sacrifice in order to make it happen.<br/><br/>An example from the most recent game. Hocus was tied up, he rolls under fire to break his bonds, 7-9.  His choices: A) Dislocate your shoulder, suffer 2-harm, and break free OR <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> fall into a psychic trance and call forth your army of young boys (recently inducted into his cult) to heroically slaughter themselves to free you.  Of course, he chose option B. <br/><br/>But the way I presented it was: "You can break free, but you know of two ways to do it. You've got a creaky old shoulder that you can pop in and out (suffer 2 harm). Dislocate it and you're free. Or, you can tap into the malestrom and use the 15 school kids who are working inside the citadel to attack your guards and kill the gate guards. A bloody melee will ensue, and you'll get out.... but you're gonna lose about 95% of those kids.  Cause, ya know, they're zerg rushing trained, adult guards."<br/><br/>All this to say, I went out of my way to try and get across, "YAY! You're free. But, now you tell me what you sacrificed to make it happen."  Is this a kind of player ego massaging you guys even bother to get into? Or do you just dispassionately present the options and let them make an inference as to whether or not that was a partial success or a partial failure?<br/><br/>Thanks for all the feedback, this has been very helpful!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449971/#Comment_449971" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-13T09:43:08+00:00" title="December 13, 2015  9:43AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2015 9:48AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am glad the advice was helpful!<br/><br/>As far as the partial failure thing, it's an interesting question. My immediate response to the question is that no, I don't go out of my way at all to try and 'spin' a 7-9 as more success than failure -- but it might also be fair to say that this rarely seems to come up as a conscious possibility, for reasons that have nothing to do with me being some sort of purist hard-ass, and have more to do with my players mostly being pretty good at going after what they want.<br/><br/>I mean, here's the thing about a hit: they DID the THING. On a 7-9, it turns out it was harder or more complicated than they might have hoped. But whatever it was, they fucking DID it -- and so the best way to make a 7-9 feel more like success than failure is to make sure the THING is really important to the character and their player.<br/><br/>And here's something about the interplay between the thing they did and the consequences when it didn't go perfectly: you're only in charge of half of that equation. You're in charge of the price, of the complication, of how it was hard. You're not in charge of the thing they decided to do: they are. You told them what was happening and said 'so what do you do?' and THEY said 'I do this THING.' And one of the major player skills of AW and arguably any game is figuring out how to get your character to do things that are ambitious and real enough to be worth paying for.<br/><br/>So if your players are constantly feeling like a 7-9 is a failure, or a punishment, maybe they just didn't care very much about doing that thing? Maybe they thought that thing was supposed to be easy? Maybe there was something weird about the fictional positioning and how the Move was set up, that has resulted in this disconnect.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Here is an example, a general one which is a thing I have definitely experienced both directly and indirectly in situations with new-to-AW-type-game players and more-experienced MCs:<br/><br/>MC: Ok here is a situation, it's rich and complicated and full of apocalyptic possibility (and I have no idea what's gonna happen with it!) WHAT DO YOU DO?!<br/><br/>Player: Uh, shit. I um... I do... I do the smallest thing I can think of that might be the right thing to do! It's only barely a move, because I'm not really sure how they work -- or I'm used to games where you're supposed to ask permission to do every little thing. But anyways the THING I DO is not super exciting (even to me) or consequential.<br/><br/>MC, <i>internal brain voice</i>: Dang, I can see this player doesn't really get the awesome things that they could be describing, or the crazy bad-ass their character could be. Good thing they rolled a 7-9 though! Now I can really help them understand that by just DOING IT FOR THEM this one time.<br/><br/>MC: Ok so you do <i>a distorted, fictionally amplified version of what they said!</i> But since you got a 7-9, I am going to describe two TOTALLY INTENSE POSSIBILITIES, each of which is amazing and full of apocalypse-barfing and also includes vastly more consequences than would really make sense from the thing you actually said you did!<br/><br/>Player: Oh, uh wow, that's not really... what I thought would... but it's cool? I guess I choose option two?!<br/><br/>MC: Awesome! Many THINGS happen that definitely seem cool and interesting to me, because I made them all up myself and you didn't actually get any input but it's ok it was just THIS ONE TIME to show you how next time you can do bigger things!<br/><br/>Player: I am even more confused and probably learned a totally different thing altogether.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>So in this example, the player is struggling to understand the scope at which Moves operate, and what they can do with them -- they don't know what the parameters of appropriate answers to 'What do you do?' really looks like, and so they can't even really ask for the things they might want for their character. And the MC gets frustrated and does it for them, and the end result is they aren't invested in the THING, even if they might still be invested in their character. <br/><br/>This is not a perfect example of the thing I started out by talking about above, but it is an example of this disconnect in play, and one way that MCs often find themselves compensating for it without necessarily helping the player get any better at doing the thing the game actually needs them to do.<br/><br/>To connect the two a bit more, consider another version of the above example but the thing the MC wants to show the player is how this is a game about hard choices and serious consequences and so they use the 7-9 result to present a really hard choice or really serious consequences <i>with the same general disconnect and amplification of the proposed character action still in place</i> -- suddenly, the player being invested in their character but NOT the thing their character is doing becomes a bigger problem, because their CHARACTER is suffering these consequences that are totally out of scale with the very small thing they said they were doing. A thing they don't even really care about! They just had to say <i>something</i> and now they suddenly have to choose between a broken arm and getting away from the slavers, which wasn't even really what they thought would happen.<br/><br/>Or, you know, imagine this happening even without any of the kind of comical overstatement I was using in my example. The player has ended up proposing that their character do something not because they were excited about doing it -- not because their character really wanted it to happen -- but for some other reason, who knows what it is. OR, they proposed the right thing, but they didn't GO FAR ENOUGH and so even if they do the thing, it won't actually have as much impact as they really wanted. And so now when the 7-9 comes up and they find out they actually have to PAY to do this thing using something they DO actually care about (their character's resources, their vision of their character as the perfect bad-ass, whatever) -- it doesn't seem fair, right? It doesn't seem fair not because the risk was inherently high or the numbers are off -- it's not fair because it turns out they just don't want the thing they are gambling for.<br/><br/>Now sometimes this just happens, because you as a player didn't really understand in this particular case what was at stake -- or you thought your character really cared, but now that push comes to shove you realise no, no they don't really care that much. And that's perfect -- that can be revelatory! -- but only if you as a player have experienced the opposite, and understand that this is one way the game is telling you something you didn't know about your character (or yourself). If it happens every time -- if it never seems worth it to pay the cost -- then something else is wrong, either with what you are asking for or what price the MC is setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449972/#Comment_449972" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-13T10:22:39+00:00" title="December 13, 2015 10:22AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>So that turned into a very long-winded description of a problem. Getting everyone on the same page about the scope of moves in AW is IMO a super-crucial and often not-obvious thing.<br/><br/>Here are some things you can try that aren't what our poor example MC is doing:<br/><br/><b>Be really explicit about the scope of the move and the kind of consequences that might happen.</b><br/><br/>The game rightly encourages its ideal players to operate as much as possible in the language of the fiction -- never speak a move's name, address yourself to the character, etc. Ultimately these are worthy goals, but sometimes you need to realise that it's more important to make sure everybody is really on the same page about what's going down.<br/><br/>Also note that this is not just advice about warning the players when the consequences might be more significant than they imagine -- in fact, that's the least important possibility. FAR MORE IMPORTANT vis-a-vis the general problem we're trying to address is making sure everyone understands how much the player (via the character, via the move) is asking for. The thing we're trying to avoid is the players not agreeing on how much is going to happen as a result of this THING they are doing and, to a lesser extent, making sure the 'how much' is consistent with how the moves have been applied in the past and how they might best be applied.<br/><br/>By making this conversation more explicit, the MC also has an opportunity to draw an outlying player out and encourage them to shift their expectations towards those of the group at large, or even for the whole group to try and shift the scope at which they want to operate in the fiction. <br/><br/>But most importantly, the goal is to just avoid the sort of confusion that makes partial successes feel like failures because the THING the player ended up asking for wasn't enough to matter.<br/><br/><b>Match the scope of your 7-9 options with the overall scope of the move.</b><br/><br/>One problem that can make 7-9 results seem unfair or like failures is if they escalate the situation in unreasonable ways -- the player wanted to win at a game of cards, but now somehow they're choosing between options in a gunfight. They were just trying to Open Their Brain but now somehow they're possessed by a murderous ghost. <br/><br/>Just as often the escalation isn't about an unexpected situation, but instead an unexpected amount of danger or risk. They expect to maybe get punched in the face but suddenly somebody has a machete; they thought they might piss off the Hardholder but now he's so pissed he's declaring a blood war; etc.<br/><br/>Escalation is a crucial tool of the AW MC, but escalation should almost never occur in the middle of a move. At the END of the move, quite possibly -- quite likely, even! -- but not in the middle.<br/><br/>Now sometimes it just turns out that the PC didn't realise how deep the water was, and suddenly they're in over their head and that's fun and real for everyone. Sometimes you as an MC have decided something about the fiction and Honesty Demands that the Hardholder really DOES get that angry, or the guy really DOES pull a machete, or whatever. But if this disconnect keeps happening -- if you're always trying to make things more intense, without any pre-planning or without any in-fiction warning -- then that's going to result in a lot of very unfair-feeling 7-9 results.<br/><br/>But also just generally, things should feel of a piece with each other. Not every Act Under Fire roll risks death and dismemberment. Not every Open Your Brain requires the Maelstrom to kill a puppy. Sometimes the stakes are lower, just generally, and if the players realise that they can use that as an opportunity to test the waters -- like maybe rolling with their -2 highlighted stat, just to see what it looks like when their Gunlugger really tries to be hot. If the players never know when things are mellow -- if trying to seduce a weirdo at the bar always seems to turn into a protracted gunfight -- then they're never going to take that chance. <br/><br/>If you want a pithier version: <b>MCs aren't the only ones who can make soft moves.</b> But the players can only make soft moves if the MC realises that's what's happening, and responds appropriately.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
