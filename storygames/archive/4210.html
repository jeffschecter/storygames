I liked the craziness of it. I loved the Gun Fu idea, but maybe you could expand it to a whole 'tree' instead of a single stunt. I felt, however, hat it was a bit railroady for my taste.<br/><br/>On pre-made SotC adventures:<br/><br/>a) I think you need pre-made characters to tie them into the story. Or at least give the players the initial premise, and then ask them to choose a temporary aspect to tie them into the story.<br/>b) You need to take aspects and declarations into account. Give examples on how to use them and perhaps try to take the more probable into account. What would happen if a PC scientist declared the skull is actually a hoax or something like that.<br/>c) You need to add some interesting or quirky mechanics to make the adventure stand apart from mere 'improv' play. Thing the GM wouldn't come up in an instant.<br/><br/>I think a SotC adventure should be less rigid than a 'trad' scenario, maybe adding some sort of meta or macro mechanic to solve the whole story. But I do think that it can be done. I'm thinking something like middle ground between InSpectres and Burining Empires...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94624/#Comment_94624" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T06:45:25+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  6:45AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your comments, elmago.

Mechanically, that's adding an aspect to the characters against which they should have some chance to resist...at least, I'd be miffed if my character didn't have some chance to resist or you didn't offer me an appropriate compel to be affected by the gas.  It doesn't seem to be all that relevant to the adventure, either, since the Werewolf aspect isn't all that bad!<br/>But that could lead to the 'quirky mechanic' suggested by Rene, above.  The kernel of the idea is that the transformation by an infected character to a werewolf form instills a severe consequence, which can be healed only by being 'cured' (finding the antidote).  In this way at most two transformations result in the character being 'taken out'.  That would put some stress on the PCs, especially if the PCs are subject to the same rules as Jenkins (they transform to werewolf when half their composure is marked off).  I'm not sure I would do it that way, though.  I think an involuntary transformation has got to be either a concession or a 'taken out' result in a conflict.  The aspect 'blue lycanthrope' effectively penalizes the PCs enough in that it can be continually tagged for +2 in social combats.  <br/>And the image of the Savoy has got me thinking elevators, stairs, external climbers--there must be a way to develop some 'quirky mechanics' to simulate a chase inside the building where the pursuit and the pursuers are using different means of movement.  I'm picturing the chase inside the prison in "The Fugitive".  I know it could be done with the current Chase rules, but the Savoy cries out for a sketch map of zones and borders and simultaneous movement...cool!<br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elmago79" title="elmago79"><img alt="elmago79" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f41/doguiii/rdh12.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elmago79">elmago79</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96015/#Comment_96015" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T11:37:58+00:00" title="September 14, 2007 11:37AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roger, I'm talking about the sort of things Mel speaks about in his post.

It made some things easier and other things harder.<br/><br/>When the characters get infected... I didn't make that as clear as I needed to.  They haven't picked up a new Aspect or anything -- they're just starting to contract the disease, so it hasn't really done anything to them yet except in the most superficial way.  So it's just pure fluff and colour, really.  I agree that just dumping full-blown blue werewolfism on them would have been a pretty jerky thing to do.<br/><br/>The whole quirky mechanics thing:  I see what you're getting at, now.  Hmmm.  Need to think a bit more on that.<br/><br/><br/>Thanks again for the feedback,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96564/#Comment_96564" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T10:34:54+00:00" title="September 16, 2007 10:34AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roger,<br/>Your adventure has inspired me to come up with one of my own, "Louis Leakey and the Mystery of the Murdered Monkey" also known as "Homo Habilis, Homicide".
