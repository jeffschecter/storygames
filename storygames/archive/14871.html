The difference there is time, I suppose - acquiring a cyber kneecap and having it installed might take up your afternoon, while physio might take months or years. I don't see any particular dangers in playing a bit fast and loose with the Restoration rules though, when it clearly makes sense within the fiction and the lockiness of the adjective is trickier than usual to deal with by the standard rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338316/#Comment_338316" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T16:39:35+00:00" title="August 11, 2011  4:39PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was in line with my gut, but wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something.

So, like Mikael said, there's no danger in being liberal with your interpretation of what a replacement could be. The main thing, as pointed out, is that it costs Kreds and likely sends the protagonists back to their connections for some favors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338505/#Comment_338505" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T16:30:50+00:00" title="August 12, 2011  4:30PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The physical stuff gelled immediately, but the "Social Damage Implant" concept got me scratching my head until I started thinking in terms of the drive being to get a downed PC to reach out for aid.<br/><br/>Also, that link really helped out as well.<br/><br/>I should be running my first game of Technoir this weekend.<br/><br/>Again, Jeremy, this is a killer app of a game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
