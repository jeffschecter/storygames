Last night was our first session and it's going to be a lot of fun.  We talked over where to set the game, and my friend Robo nailed it - "Let's set it on a cruise ship", he said.<br/><br/>In terms of social commentary, the cruise ship picks up where <i>Dawn of the Dead's</i> mall leaves off.  It's pure gold, with a platinum topping of race and class issues.  Rich Americans, rich Dutch officers, and a mob of Indonesian and Filipino service staff.  We all gravitated toward crew.  We've got two Filipino domestic staffers, a National Park Service naturalist/interpreter (we're cruising the Inside passage in Alaska), and a sorority sister.  In addition, we sketched out a dozen random NPCs.  <br/><br/>So the first session began with us holed up in a chain locker on "deck zero" as the madness raged all around us.  We discovered how each of the survivors got there and first encountered the zombie menace in disconnected flashback scenes.  In these scenes, everybody but the focus character played a random NPC.  NPCs who survived ended up in the chain locker with us, usually with a Key that tied them to a PC or the group.  We had a map of the ship, and Steve had recently been on board and really brought it to life for us in all its pornographic splendor.  There was a lot of "the frat party is in the Breezeway lounge on the Lido deck!" going on.  The initial body count was fairly low, but it looks like it is going to pick up.  At the end of the session, our characters could hear the lifeboats dropping from their davits as the ship's mains went off-line, leaving everything bathed in shadowy red emergency lighting.  There was a lot of screaming from outside the chain locker door.  The naturalist sort of summed up our shitty situation with a pithy comment:  "Who's driving the boat?"                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128383/#Comment_128383" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T05:26:51+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  5:26AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, when I first read through, I scanned naturalist as naturist and it was a completely different experience...<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128401/#Comment_128401" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T06:43:40+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  6:43AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the curious, this ship of blood is the <a href="http://www.hollandamerica.com/cruise-vacation-onboard/Amsterdam" rel="nofollow">MS Amsterdam</a>, on it's return voyage from Ketchikan, AK.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128811/#Comment_128811" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T16:42:25+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  4:42PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            very cool!

As it happens I wrote up a dozen NPCs and those are the ones we called on in play, more or less randomly.  I'm not sure how Steve is handling zombies - I assume like beasts.  We treated flashbacks as regular scenes, so there were dice, bonus dice, and so forth.  They were not at all anticlimactic.  All of the session's action took place in flashback.  <br/><br/>For a game that purposefully mixes flashback and as-it-happens narrative, might I suggest <i>Grey Ranks?</i>  Or would that make me a tool?  <i>Classroom Deathmatch</i> has a very explicit flashback mechanic as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130144/#Comment_130144" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T07:52:41+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  7:52AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Nate,<br/><br/>I'm experimenting a bit with the zombies, but yeah, basically they're beasts because I'm not giving them Keys (or personalities).  I'm using normal Pools and Abilities for them, however, and I cooked up a handful of "walking dead" Secrets as well.  Partly this is because I wanted to diversify the kind of threat the zombies represent.  I created one "creature" that is an individual, classic zombie.  Then I set up another that is a "threat" zombie (your modern day fast zombie).  Finally, I also created stats for a "pack of zombies", where the mass is represented by a higher Vigor pool.  I'm hoping to interchange these with other types of conflicts (panic, dangerous survivors, environmental hazards, trust issues, heartbreak, etc.) to help us create a really fun game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130515/#Comment_130515" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T09:16:14+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  9:16AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BTW, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/02/26/cruise.ship.illness.ap/index.html" rel="nofollow">African Rabies On Cruise Ship</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130525/#Comment_130525" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T09:49:54+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  9:49AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks James- that feels just right for a cover-story after the zombie outbreak on board is cleaned up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131127/#Comment_131127" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T05:41:41+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  5:41AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2008 5:43AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's Steve pointing out the location of the Bridge on the Navigation deck:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.meekmok.com/sassy/images/deck_plans.jpg"/><br/>We had a great, tense session last night - our goal was to get from the crew quarters on Deck Zero up to the bridge, maybe trip the EPIRB or send an SOS message, maybe get the ship underway.  That comprised the entire session!  We had our first real zombie fighting experience.  Best moment:  We fight our way onto the only elevator with emergency power (cue "Girl from Ipanema").  We start to ascend to the Navigation deck.  The elevator stops on the Lido deck (wide open, full of recreation stuff).  We hear bumping, scratching, muffled cries.  The doors open (we can't stop them).  There's a woman protecting her child, backed up against the elevator door, fending off zombies with an elderly passenger's walker.  The "door close" sensor keeps tripping, the doors won't shut.  So my guy pushes her out - shoves her into the zombies in a panic - it's a BDTP conflict and I win, she's meat, we close the doors. And my guy is standing there, covered in blood, catching his breath, and he looks down to see the woman's little boy.  His name is Danny.  Ding!

Last night we played the *other* set of survivors (our player attendance has been irregular) - we had a 19-year-old sorority girl and the Filipino housekeeper who loved her from afar, the clueless events coordinator, and Kitkat Tampipi - also a housekeeper but rapidly evolving into a ruthless ninja with Key of the Exterminator.  The cruise ship is in trouble - only emergency power, stabilization knocked out, zombies prowling every corridor.  Most of the lifeboats are gone, and both groups of survivors are fighting their way toward Boat Station 11 on the Promenade deck, where the last motor launch was supposed to be.  This group made a detour to "deck zero" to rescue some friends, including Diday the beautician and the irritating, wheelchair-bound Dr. Smallwood.  The race and class divides on the boat were brought into stark relief when we met up with a group of Indonesians who had molded themselves into a tight core of zombie fighters - but who didn't really distinguish between the living and the dead, unless they spoke Bahasa.  There was a great Bringing Down the Pain moment where Kitkat faced off with the leader of these yeggs and cowed him with her empty pistol.  <br/><br/>TSOY is really supporting the genre - zombies are essentially an environmental menace, occasionally stepping up as full-fledged physical opponents, but what's really driving the game our the character's Keys.  Next week we've agreed that once we find out who makes it aboard the motor launch (which <i>isn't </i>at Boat Station 11), we'll switch GMs as the survivors come ashore somewhere somewhere on Kupreanof Island in southeast Alaska.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136647/#Comment_136647" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T09:38:45+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  9:38AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            it sounds very cool Jason.<br/>\ni ran a game of TSOY last night, and used some Secrets and Keys from your 'Shadows of Zombies' site.<br/>\na question came up by one of the players, and here it is...Secret of Knowledge, the way it's written, why not just bump up your level in that Attribute?  <br/>\ncan you choose what you're going to bump up EVERYTIME you use it?  i'm not sure i get it?<br/>\nthanks in advance!<br/>\nand what do you think about players introducing backstory functioning as Refreshment?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136653/#Comment_136653" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T10:13:24+00:00" title="March 27, 2008 10:13AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, flashbacks as refreshment is a must for survival horror.<br/><br/>I don't think we changed Secret of Knowledge from what's written in TSOY.

I hadn't had a chance to do any real prep, so I employed the Mountain Witch Trick over and over again:<br/><br/>"OK, you need an Instinct refresh?  Flashback, you and your wife are hiking on Mt. Edgecumbe outside Sitka, it's six years ago.  You have something important to tell her.  What is it?"<br/><br/>And I did some heavy-handed character-building stuff:<br/><br/>"What's your daughter's name, and how old is she?"  (Player didn't know his guy had a daughter)<br/><br/>I also off-loaded quite a bit of narrative authority:<br/><br/>"That zombie five year old is going to return at the worst possible moment - you guys tell me when that is."<br/><br/>It was a good session - we finally got some classic "barricaded cabin in the woods" action going, and since all the zombies were neighbors and friends of one of the PCs, that added a frisson of calamity to the whole thing.  One difficulty for me as GM is that one guy (thanks, Isbo) is now a Grand Master at zombie slaying, which makes providing challenges pretty difficult - he slices through my zombie mopes like butter.

I've never figured out a really good way to use those as a GM- it always seemed a bit forced- "Hey, if you play this next scene I'll give you experience points!".  However, using flashbacks (or "meanwhile, on the other side of town..." scenes) seems like a smoother way to integrate them.<br/><br/>The story-prompting would help in Key Scenes because it could provide some structure to the experience point reward. a GM could give PCs xps based on the degree to which they accept new plot twists and complications from the scene.  I guess it's a little like Fate points in that way- "Okay, so you guys are racing through the jungle to the airstrip.

He wanted to know what kind of game we played on Game Night, so we explained it and got him to help us roleplay, roll some dice, see what was up.  His eyes were like <i>fire! </i> He totally got the concepts of characters, collaboration, random elements and we're going to have a special pre-game session with him next week (the game normally starts right at bed time for him).  <br/><br/>Then he left and the zombies basically ate Sitka.  Steve's guy "rescued" his eight-year-old daughter, who was safe in the custody of her maternal grandfather (who hates Steve's deadbeat dad character passionately).  There was an epic Bringing Down the Pain over who would protect the girl, and how.  Steve lost, with some bonus die help for the GM from his fellow players.  <br/><br/>Using flashbacks for refresh scenes is so, so good.  We established a relationship predicated on sexual tension between two PCs last night that just ratchets up the stories of both characters, and we also discovered that Greg's guy, a Tlingit fisherman from Angoon, has a weird spiritual side and some strange connection to the mythological cannibal spirit.  He basically believes he brought this down on the world.  I guess it was the night of fathers-in-law, because he met his, too, and abandoned him to the hordes.  <br/><br/>Now they are holed up in Sheldon Jackson college, looking for a way to get to the harbor and a sailboat.  We're about to switch GMs so I have no idea what's next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144126/#Comment_144126" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T05:29:25+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  5:29AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The highlight of last night's session - Greg, who has never played TSOY before, is playing Jody, a Tlingit fisherman who has seen his entire extended family come back from the dead.

Perhaps not coincidentally, it was a session that relied almost entirely on Romero-style genre tropes.  We finally got to the point where the zombies are an environmental threat and we're way more worried about our fellow survivors.  Two good moments:<br/><br/>1.  Chico, Sitka's only pimp, is getting pulled into the oil change pit in a Costco tire shop and my guy is trying very hard to save him.  The zombie horde is pretty strong, I'm losing, time to bring down the pain.  So we have this epic conflict where <i>Chico </i>takes vigor harm as I battle the mob trying to pull him into their grease pit.<br/><br/>2.  Pitch black harshness:  We manage to rescue a large family with four kids and get them inside the fortified Costco.  One of the kids is infected. We explain to his mom what's going to happen in the next 30 minutes, but she's not hearing it.  She manages to scatter her kids in the inky bowels of the lightless Costco warehouse, and we have to go hunt them down before the infected one turns and bites his three siblings (and maybe us).  We know that if my guy finds the infected kid, he'll truss him up and wait until he turns and give his family a chance to say goodbye.  We know that if another guy finds him, he'll get beaten to death on the spot.  The other guy (Bongbong, one of the original Filipino cruise ship survivors) finds the now-zombie child and destroys him.  He shows up with the other three struggling kids - and a human bite on his thigh.  "It wasn't him, it was one of these," Bongbong says, and we <i>so </i>don't believe him.

The timing was perfect - our Costco was being overrun by zombies, some lunatic had drugged everybody and called in an airstrike, Hipster Dad was bitten and about to turn, things were truly FUBAR.  So we all turned to Ian and it was his moment - we set up a situation where Bongbong sacrificed himself to save all his friends lives, got bitten taking down the fast zombie who was our nemesis, and then got shot by the NPC we all hate.  <br/><br/>Transcendence is such a good game mechanic - it gracefully transitions out characters who have grown to the edge of human-scale achievement.

Brad's got a bonus die because he's got the shotgun, his signature weapon.  And we all mull over what would make good stakes for this clash of the titans, and decide it's all about <i>sexual tension </i>- somebody is going to fall hard for somebody, a person they pretty much hate, and acknowledge their authority in the process.  Naturally the bonus dice <i>flew </i>at the GM, because we all really wanted Kitkat to lose!  And she did.  Maybe Brad's not so bad after all - he's a take-charge guy, a survivor, and pretty good looking, too.  Hmm.  That's was really fun to set up, and how it will play out is going to be even better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151588/#Comment_151588" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-19T05:05:33+00:00" title="June 19, 2008  5:05AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2008 5:08AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really trying to only report on interesting situations that engage with the TSoY rules in useful ways here.  This sorta breaks with that but it was a great move, so read on:<br/><br/>Last night at the top of the game Steve, the GM, lists all the surviving NPCs.  There are twelve.  "Each of you pick one you'd like to see continue," he said, "and the rest are absolutely in peril tonight."<br/><br/>So we each get a delicious decision - do I want my guy's 90 year old grandmother to have zombie immunity?  Or do I want a colorful, troublemaking character - the sort who usually dies in zombie movies - to be safe?  What about another PC's wife?  Mike deliberately picks an NPC we all loathe.  It was cool.  Of the people we did not pick, we lost 2.5.  <br/><br/>Ok, so system in action - things are predictably FUBAR.  Kitkat is guarding my guy's grandmother, who is voiding her bladder behind the bus as we stop to check out a crashed SWAT van in Bothell.  Zam!  Attack by zombie SWAT guys in body armor!  Kitkat's engaged.  She loses a conflict where the stakes involve grandma getting grabbed.  Mike thinks about it, looks at Kitkat's sheet, and realizes he needs to shake down his harm.  So he brings down the pain just long enough to shake it down and then gives, basically abandoning Eunice Williams to the flesh-eating horde.  Bastard!  Her grandson rescued her, but barely, after a tense second BDTP conflict that was all about me trying to get my guy's nail gun under the zombie's face shield as he tried to bite grandma.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153077/#Comment_153077" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T04:46:18+00:00" title="June 26, 2008  4:46AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We swapped GMs this week, and fast-forwarded the game two months and 700 miles east, to Salt Lake City.  Robo, our new GM, spent a good amount of time easing us into the new circumstances, so the session was talk-heavy, and we had a full house - six players, which is unusual.  The interesting thing about this was that the combination of six people and not a lot of action meant the bonus die economy was slightly borked - we had more dice than conflicts, so every time the dice got rolled, tons of bonus dice were flying on both sides.  I think a good rule of thumb for a TSOY GM is to try to structure a session so that all the bonus dice get used - they are a pacing mechanism as much as a systemic support.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153103/#Comment_153103" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T08:35:23+00:00" title="June 26, 2008  8:35AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bonus dice are a pacing mechanism?

If you have bonus dice left over, that could mean that you have too few engaging moments, or disengaged players.  So if, as GM, you angle to provide those opportunities and keep them going, a dwindling pool of bonus dice is a good measure of success and you can structure conflict frequency and intensity accordingly.  I've never seen a session where everybody ran out of dice, but that seems like a worthwhile goal to me.  Much of this is group style, I'm sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157112/#Comment_157112" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-17T05:33:40+00:00" title="July 17, 2008  5:33AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We're probably three or four sessions from the conclusion of this game now.  There are still a few original characters (two, actually, one an NPC), but most of the raggedy-ass crew has been picked up along the way.  My current favorite is Walter, a twelve-year-old orphan (he didn't start out that way) with a prosthetic limb (it didn't start out that way).  Naturally, he's got Secret of the Signature Weapon for his claw hand.  Also, he's now undead and probably out to get us.  <br/><br/>We've been getting better and better at crafting effective and juicy intentions and setting appropriate stakes.  One way you can tell this is happening is the distribution of gift dice - if the GM is getting as many as the player, thems some good stakes.  <br/><br/>Last night's session was a rescue mission to the University of Utah Hospital, where some of the last survivors in SLC (and my guy's grandmother) were being overrun.  It was a classic horror moment - isolated, split up, in the dark, in a hospital, zombies thick as flies.  There was a scary fight in an MRI room and a lot of cool action.  Half the group was barricaded in a medical records office with a nurse who had been bitten.  Some of the characters are hardened lunatics who would have killed her on the spot, but they were all elsewhere, so the nurse was safe.  Of course she turned at the worst possible moment, and there was a terrible, blood-slippery fight in the record stacks, during which two characters got bitten, including little Walter.  About this time the hard cases returned.  Jody, who has had a thousand-yard stare since he put down his entire undead family in Alaska, is the hardest of hard cases.  He heard the fighting, went in alone, and shot the zombie nurse.  He looked over Walter and Erin, saw the bite marks, bit his lip and (with the hearty approval of the players in question) gunned them down.  We all agreed that Walter, already infected, was sure to return.  <br/><br/>A big part of the fun was carefully crafting intentions, and giving those to the GM to set stakes.  We all offered up our best ideas when they occurred but left it ultimately in the GM's hands.  We also explicitly agreed that the death flag was flying, and nobody's character was off limits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157124/#Comment_157124" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-17T07:21:55+00:00" title="July 17, 2008  7:21AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FWIW, I think Walter's fate isn't entirely decided.

The big take-away for me is that if the conflict <i>matters </i>enough, it's extremely satisfying to be a spectator in Solar System rules.  Zombie stories are really human stories, and we've played ours long enough to build up a good head of human interest steam.<br/><br/>We're in a compound run by a fundamentalist Mormon cult.  The leader of the cult, Elder Tobias, is a former government scientist who worked with our own PC government scientist on the Black Swan project, and he's discovered a way to pacify individual zombies.  Unfortunately, he's also a complete lunatic who ascribes his miraculous ability to his new-found faith.  We are <i>desperate </i>to get out of this situation.<br/><br/>One PC, the useless drug-runner and con man Jack Casey, finally connects with the fellow survivor, an Indonesian prep cook named Artie, and although the Key of Unrequited Love is not bought off, they hook up.  Jack's a happy guy.  Not for long.  <br/><br/>Things get crazy and we end up getting summoned by Elder Tobias, where we learn his identity and that he is a Master of Sway.  All this leads up to a fantastic 4-way conflict.  We're given permission to leave, but Jack's eight-year-old daughter, Julie, wants to stay.  The cultists are nice.  It feels safe in the compound.  She's sick of the bus and the zombies.<br/><br/>Jack obviously loves his daughter.<br/>Jody, another survivor, has Key of the Guardian for her.  He's pretty insane and lost his own little girl, about the same age.<br/>Julie, an NPC, wants to stay.<br/>Tobias, also an NPC and a powerful one, won't let her go.<br/><br/>So it's a huge conflict, Jody and Julie have a side conflict to assign penalty dice to the larger conflict, Pain is Brought Down, and Jack loses.  He hangs his head and <i>abandons his daughter.</i>  At least he's got his new hottie, right?  It was so, so good.  XP was flying.  Helping dice were flying on both sides.  <br/><br/>So the rest of us are standing there, between Elder Tobias and his six armed guards and two zombie brides*, and we're all "hell no".  Each of us is at the breaking point.  My guy is on the cusp of losing his faith.  Jody is destroyed by guilt over what he did last session.  And Chico isn't going to let a little girl fall into these people's zombie-lovin' hands.  We all know that we're going to die, and we're all good with that.  It's going to be a hell of a throw-down.<br/><br/>One interesting thing is that Ian, one of my friends, basically had no character in the session.  His main dude died last week and he played a string of NPCs and might have had more fun than any of us.  <br/><br/>*Yeah, I know right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161115/#Comment_161115" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-07T04:48:01+00:00" title="August  7, 2008  4:48AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2008 4:49AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We wrapped this up last night, and we knew it was the last session, so we played hard.  I kept thinking "we should play this hard all the time".  Each of us had a big issue to resolve, and we were all burning through Keys, harvesting XP like idiots and spending to to raise skills, buy up pools, and generally go nuts.  Midway through the session the last bonus die was allocated, which made later conflicts that much more tense.  Our usual laid back approach was seriously abandoned for the night.<br/><br/>My guy, the evangelical Craig, had a fantastic end!  There was this family - Hipster Dad, Hipster Mom, and little Walter - and they had their own tragic arc.  Dad got bit and slowly turned, but Craig brought him to Jesus before he zombified.  Then he converted Hipster Mom.  Then, on the long cross-country slog, Hipster Mom was eaten by zombies and Walter lost his arm.  Then Walter got fitted for a metal-hook prosthesis and got infected himself - we left him behind in a panic.  So naturally he returned as a zombie to menace us!  13-year-old amputee zombie.  We're in the dark, all hell is breaking loose, and we hear the scraping of metal.  Craig's like "come out where we can see you, we know you're alive because zombies don't carry metal things that scrape on the wall..."  His best friend (mutual Key of Fraternity) buys off his Key and abandons Craig.  And Walter surprises him, and we fight, and Pain is Brought Down.  Walter is winning bad - at one point, I've got three penalty dice, and the writing is on the wall.  And Mike describes the faintest glimmer of recognition in Walter's dead eyes, and Craig changes his intention and dies pleading with the boy, telling him he saved Walter's parents, they are in a better place, Craig begs him to turn around and leave his old friends alone ... as he bleeds out and finally gets bitten.  It was <i>awesome</i>.<br/><br/>The game was just stuffed with memorable moments and wonderfully-drawn characters.  The strong relationships our guys had with one another, and the other NPC survivors, coupled with a lethal and focused world we could all imagine pretty easily, just drove the game to a satisfying conclusion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161130/#Comment_161130" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-07T07:21:09+00:00" title="August  7, 2008  7:21AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

A marijuana "entrepreneur" operating out of the wilderness of Barinof Island, AK, Jack was introduced to the walking dead when an infected passenger expired on his plane.  His luck went from bad to worse after that- he lost his grow operation, his plane, and his home as he was forced to flee with the others to Seattle.  Sure, he managed to rescue his estranged 10 year old daughter, but only after proving himself a spineless hustler in front of his ex-father in law and leaving his ex-wife for dead.<br/><br/>The only thing that really mattered to Jack was Arti, the beautiful, mute survivor from the doomed MS Amsterdam.  He adored her, and she kept him at arm's length for months, all the way from Alaska to Salt Lake City.  Finally he laid his heart on the line and made his play for her, and won!  He was ecstatic- and that's when Charlie Company came to New Zion and let all the zombies in.  In the chaos that followed, Jack once again tried to man up and force the Mormon leader to help them escape, and once again he was crushed, helplessly giving up his only daughter and losing the respect of his friends.<br/><br/>In a final attempt to prove himself, Jack tried to commandeer a vehicle to get Arti and his friends to safety.  He boldly approached the machine-gun wielding soldier atop a nearby Humvee, holding out a live grenade and threatening to kill them all.  Weak and desperate, in the chaos of battle, Jack was playing a big con- the grenade in his hand was a harmless flashbang.  Unfortunately he wasn't fooling a seasoned veteran, and one shot from the machine gun put all his scams to rest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162181/#Comment_162181" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-12T05:20:18+00:00" title="August 12, 2008  5:20AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, Steve, <i>really.  </i>You forgot to mention the best (and most TSOY-rific) part of that story - Arti was in the back of that Humvee, a prisoner of Charlie Company, and watched the whole deal go down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162324/#Comment_162324" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-12T18:29:07+00:00" title="August 12, 2008  6:29PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is so full of awesome!!
