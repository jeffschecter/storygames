                    First, a disclaimer. I don't particularly understand "Immersionism" as conventionally defined. I don't believe that my character has emotions or perceptions, and so I'm quite confused by the idea of living those out. However, I also have no real desire to discuss this issue, as I think it stems from a fairly deep psychological difference between myself and those who Immerse. If you want to have that discussion, please form another thread.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, a thought I had:<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I watch a really awesome movie, or read a particularly good book, the rest of the world just sort of fades away for a bit. Time passes without my realising. In a sense, I am immersed in the book or the movie. However, I don't have to identify with any of the characters, or feel like I've been transported to some fantasy world. I can sit there and focus on the cinematography, or the poetic language, or whatever, and feel immersed in a sense.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine most of us have had similar experiences in gaming: those games where you happen to glance at the clock and realise that it's 4am, you've been playing for 10 hours straight, and you haven't eaten since lunchtime. Games that suck you in and hold you there. I call this "getting into the Zone".<br/>
<br/>
Now, I think that for one who Immerses, that's probably a really good way of achieving such a game. In fact, when people say that they enjoy Immersion, I'm pretty sure that at least some of the time, they mean that it's a quick and easy way for them to get into the Zone. But not all of us enjoy Immersion, or even find it easy/possible. However, I'm still pretty sure we can get into the Zone. It just requires different gaming techniques.<br/>
<br/>
So what are these techniques? How can we, as gamers, have games like this when we want to? How can we, as designers, make our games in such a way as to promote this kind of play?<br/>
<br/>
I think Polaris has made some big steps here. The ritual phrases, the darkened room, the lighting of the candle, all provide a way of filtering out the world outside the game, and promoting a kind of trance-like state (something Ben seems to have put a lot of thought into). Are there other examples out there of games that specifically promote this sort of play?                </div>

                            I think Poker creates a semi-hypnotic mood, especially if there's a single light source above, cigar(ette) smoke in the air and a social charge to the game itself.<br/>
<br/>
As for roleplaying, I suspect any game that incorporates a strong story mechanic helps to engage the players moreso than normal.  Horror games often seem to succeed as a "mood", often as a result of controlled lighting, playing at night, and a collective sense of dread/fear that both GM and players seem eager to engender.                        </div>

                            Rituals. Indeed, Polaris implements some ideas discussed in a couple of Forge's threads about ritual techniques. Polaris initiation and closing actions, the repetitive phrases, they are part of its ritualistic techniques.<br/>
<br/>
Rituals involve mechanics and tricks (such as ilumination change) that help you split the "game-time" from the social talk before and after it. The rituals themselves create a sand-box for the game experience. They are a safety mechanism which helps people to get immerse and at the same time clearly distinguish the game experience from the real-live.<br/>
<br/>
Martin, do you think you get better "into the Zone" when you see a movie or read a book sitting in your prefered sofa, or with specific ilumination, or just before going to sleep, as many people? Creating a kind of atmosphere is a ritual technique and it typically improves the experience.<br/>
<br/>
Other techniques may be using evocative talk and a lot of color (but avoiding too specific details) to let your mind fly in the imagined world.                        </div>

                            Some of the warmup games played by long-form improv troupes (less Whose Line, more <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://greenlightwiki.com/improv/Harold" rel="nofollow">Harold</a>) sound like they'd be useful here.  They're designed to build a sense of group coordination, cue acceptance and reliance on instinct that are useful in any real-time collaborative game.  The <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.chicagoimprov.org/wiki/index.php?title=Exercises" rel="nofollow">Chicago Improv wiki</a> lists some good ones and some less good ones; my troupe got some good use out of Yes, Zip Zap Zop and Counting (the latter with our eyes closed).                        </div>
