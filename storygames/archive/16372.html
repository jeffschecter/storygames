It was a very gonzo game, but not in an absurd way: given that the game is unashamedly <b>Victorian Fringe</b>, some Walter Bishop-like eccentricity didn't feel amiss. There was an exciting moment for some respected gentleman when they discovered a Magic Lantern slide of an elk and spent an hour or two on the train journey to Cambridge just looking at it and pulling the lever to appear to make it's legs move!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, an errata, of course: OK, I totally put my hands up this, but the scenario should obviously be called <i>The <b>Dog</b> Who Walks Through Walls</i> and the murder weapon is a phantom <i>dog</i>. Sometimes a good title pushes out all common sense...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
