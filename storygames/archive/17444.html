I have altered the base mechanic to be played with playing cards rather than dice, simply to add a new twist to the already familiar and amazing core system.<br/><br/>On the Fraying Edge is a narrative zombie survival game where a group of protagonists struggle day by day to search for supplies, maintain their Stronghold, avoid the horde and of course, deal with their own inner demons. This is still VERY much in it's early stages but I welcome advice and ideas for how to add to the narrative and clean up the mechanics.<br/><br/>Here is the rules document and a basic character sheet I've mocked up. I hope those of you who can take the time to read through it enjoy it. Thank you as ever. <br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B0a_iGRNRo6BVk5ZT0hoamtjcVE/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B0a_iGRNRo6BVk5ZT0hoamtjcVE/edit</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
