The parks go from crazy busy to easy-to-get-into.  I went to Yosemite a few years back in early Nov and there felt like there were like 12 people in the whole park!</blockquote>\nIn principle: Yes! Late September to October is the ideal time.<br/>In practice: this year, such a thing will probably not be instigated by the currently designated NBP ringleaders (myself, JBR, Paul Tevis). Josh and Paul are busy August to mid-September with con season, and Nancy and I are busy mid-September to late-October with getting married and going to Japan. Past late October, we miss the good camping season, because things get Cold and Wet and then we can't snigger at the people freezing at Camp Nerdly while we <a href="http://nerdlybeachparty.org/index.php?title=Image:Jesse%2BJustin_at_Sorcerer.JPG" rel="nofollow">chill in the sun</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/doublefeh/445648809/" rel="nofollow">drinking margaritas and gin</a>.<br/><br/>An August "Not going to GenCon, but wish you were?" Bay Area camp con was supposed to tide us [me] over, but, as mentioned, I didn't get a move on soon enough to secure camping.<br/><br/>Uh, there is some chance that I could still set it up for the weekend after Labor Day. It's the week after ConQuest, but that may not be such a big deal, and a lot of campsites mysteriously free up space the moment Labor Day is past.

Dinners will basically be bring your own grillables, and I'll make sure that either the firepits have grill spots or to bring a charcoal grill. <br/><br/>Non-player family has been a troublesome element for both Camp Nerdly and Nerdly Beach Party. It has yet to work out well. To make matters worse, camping is unlikely to involve well-segregated space conducive to 'officially adult' areas or the like. Unless this ends up being a lot more people than I'm expecting, I'm inclined to dodge the issue and close the event to non-participants. I know that doesn't work out best for everybody, but one goal is to keep this low-impact.<br/><br/>Assuming there are enough all-weekend people to go forward, though, there's probably room for some to just show up for a day. I'm thinking either Big Basin or Portola Redwoods state parks, both of which are easy day trips from the valley.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78874/#Comment_78874" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-30T00:09:23+00:00" title="June 30, 2007 12:09AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sadly didn't work with with NBP 1, but that was with one child &amp; no one who seemed engaged to play custodian while his dad gamed.

It would probably end up being really annoying for everybody.<br/><br/>My daughter on the other hand, is six years old and is always really eager to please.

I did take my 10 yo daughter with me to Kublacon this year ( one day only) and it worked out well. It might be worth looking more closely at how thos efolks do things and seeing if it can work on a smaller scale.<br/><br/>My suspicion is really that the number of kids has to hit a certain "critical mass" where they can begin to socialize mostly with one another.
