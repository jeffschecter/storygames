Tomorrow afternoon, we leave to drive to a beach house in Galveston where, her 16 year-old brother assures me, there is almost nothing to do.  Two of his friends are coming with us, and have made plans to bring instruments and video games to amuse themselves.  He's heard me go on about Games before, so he suggested that he and I and one of his friends (according to him, the other one wouldn't be interested) play some MERP.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had never even heard of MERP before, but it's apparently all he and his friends play.  I may still try to play it with them, but from what the S.O. says, it's everything about D&amp;D-alikes that I don't find fun.  That, and the way her brother argues how unlike D&amp;D it is, has convinced me that I should run a game or two of something we can all find fun, and that might expose us to a wider range of gaming experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nBig Problem: My awesome-o RPG library is back in Maryland.  I am the king of planning ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I'm looking for games that I can get before I go beyond the reach of the internet, glorious source of answers that it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome tenative (as in, I realize I might be wrong and please tell me if I am) requirements:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Electronic.  Obviously, I can't wait for shipping, and I don't know what's available in the area.  A pdf can be downloaded and printed out (or stored on a laptop if it's too long) in nothing flat.  Obviously, any product sold on RPGnow or Drivethru would be fine.  <br/>\n2) Not already owned by me.  I don't own a laptop, and having both the print and pdf versions of a book doesn't really appeal to me.  Also, there's a lot of great games out there that I don't own yet, and I'm not above using this as an impetus to get some more.  I won't give you a list, but I will say that (unfortunately) Mountain Witch and With Great Power are both out.<br/>\n3) Targeted appeal.  I haven't played with them yet, so I can't be overly specific, but I know that these guys like the way they play, chart consultation and all.  I want to challenge them, but I worry they might snap back if I push too hard.  I don't want anything too 'out there.'  Interpret as loosely as you like.<br/>\n4) Fast.  The phrase is 'low barrier to entry'.  My most recent fave game is Artesia, at least in part for it's long and immensely entertaining character generation system, but that seems like it might not be suited for the lazy days situation.  I don't want the game to feel like work at any point.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are already a few games simple enough that I've memorized them, and thus will be 'brought with' by definition.  WUSHU is the big one that I'm definitely trying to fit in.  The startup edition of Inspectres is fairly straightforward, though I'm sad to not remember cool dice, weird agents and how to handle traits given by testimonials.  Finally, the S.O. says I have to try starting a game of Kazekami Kyoko Kills Kublai Khan on the car-ride down.<br/>\n<br/>\nPossibilities I have noticed and am considering beyond those:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Roanoke.  I love WUSHU intensely, and it sounds awesome.  Maybe a bit dark and 'weird' for the target audience, but at 5$, I may buy it anyway and take my chances.<br/>\n* Contenders.  I have heard this is a great, broadly appealing pick up game, with the ability to appeal to both sides of the brain.  <br/>\n* Spirit of the Century.  People can't stop gushing about it, and I've been planning on buying it for a while.  I suppose I'd rather have a print than pdf edition, but I could have fun with both later, and only have fun with the latter this week.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, to get to the point, I would really appreciate the help, perspective and brilliance of the fandom.  So please, if you have any ideas, please name them, briefly explain why they are suited to my situation, and tell me where I can get them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf everything works out, I'll report my purchases in these threads, and even give an AP report when I get home in two weeks.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60147/#Comment_60147" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-09T10:32:59+00:00" title="March  9, 2007 10:32AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to suggest trying out the <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/The_Shab-al-Hiri_Roach.php" rel="nofollow">Shab-al-Hiri Roach</a>, for entirely selfish reasons: my gaming group has had a frankly horrible time trying to get into story games (even PrimeTime Adventures doesn't grab 'em, and god help any game that calls on us to do more narration than that).  I want to hear how a game like this one plays with a group more familiar with old-school traditional RPGs like MERP, because we haven't had an opening on our gaming schedule yet to test it ourselves.<br/><br/>BE OUR GUINEA PIG!  I can't offer you anything in return, not even bottled water and cedar chips, but from the pdf the game looks like it's ridiculously easy to set up and could hit the same nerves that a really awesome game of <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> does.  Plus, it sounds fast and highly focused, which tend to be positive qualities for a pickup game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60149/#Comment_60149" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-09T10:39:41+00:00" title="March  9, 2007 10:39AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2007 10:50AM by Thomas D.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you own Primetime Adventures, you probably know the rules, which means you don't need electronic delivery.  While PTA doesn't fit under the "targeted appeal" section of your wishlist, you can pitch it to them as Middle Earth as an ongoing television series.  Although they like the charts, they might want to try something different.  PTA is pretty darn fast.

You'll have to start up a bookshelf account and wait for Matt to throw the switch to get the file.<br/><br/>If you want a dungeon-crawl like experience and can get your hands on a lot of d20s (about ten might do you good), try Donjon.  <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=294" rel="nofollow">RPGnow has it for $6.75</a>  It comes with a low-level adventure, too.

Anyway, you already saw my first two suggestions over there; either Spirit of the Century or The Shadow of Yesterday, both of which have their mechanics available for free online.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, upon further consideration, I think Agon might be a better choice.  It's got totally awesome combat mechanics and a competitive streak - it should blow your players minds if they're used to MERPS.  The drawback is of course the lack of a free SRD.  You can get the PDF for $10.00 from the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.agon-rpg.com/" rel="nofollow">website</a>, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Side note to John Harper: Any particular reason you don't sell the PDF through IPR or Lulu?

This means that once you start playing, you might be able to interest Grandpa Joe and Aunt Eileen as well as your MERP crew.  It's not a close match with your initial requirements but it <i>is </i>unspeakably awesome.  That low barrier to entry also means it doens't behave in ways the MERP guys will be accustomed to - just an observation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60306/#Comment_60306" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-09T21:44:21+00:00" title="March  9, 2007  9:44PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So Contenders and The Shadows of Yesterday are games I think you could jump right into.<br><br>They are my vote.  <br/><br/>As an aside if you have any questions about Artesia let me know, it's my current game of choice (and the one I am running with my Burning Wheel conversion over the course of the year).

If my plans fail, it certainly won't be due to insufficient assistance from a great bunch of people.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe leave just after noon today.  After much deliberation, I have printed out the Shadow of Yesterday SRD (after a little trouble finding book 2), and Contenders.  I have high hopes for both.  I plan to spend at least part of the long road from Dallas to Galveston with three teens in the back seat discussing a setting for the SoY game, and part of it playing KKKKK (beats 'Wheels on the Bus' and 'Ninety-nine Bottles of Beer').  <br/>\n<br/>\nAll those games suggested which I do not currently own, I now wish to.  Hopefully with some proactivity I'll get a lot of gaming in this summer, because my back-log of bought and unplayed games keeps growing!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy spring break has jumped hugely in potential fun quotient, due to friendly interaction with gamers online!  If I don't get around to my school-assigned reading and writing, I will hold the internet responsible!<br/>\n<br/>\nWish me luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
