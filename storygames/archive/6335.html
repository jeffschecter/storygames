Are you encoding 128k and stereo? Do you actually use the stereo? I know I'm poking my nose into your business here, but you could reduce your filesize by breaking your two stereo tracks into mono tracks and then everything will get put into one track for half the size. I think that unless you are mixing your show so that when two people talk at the same time you put them in a different track... that you will struggle to notice the difference. Of course maybe the size isn't an issue for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan" title="MPOSullivan"><img alt="MPOSullivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/581/nMZWSVRTOY7XL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan">MPOSullivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140389/#Comment_140389" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-18T14:28:07+00:00" title="April 18, 2008  2:28PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey everyone!<br/><br/>I just got back in from work and I wanted to just pop in real quick and say thank you to Rob for sitting down with me and letting me talk about my game.  Criminal Element is something that has been very important to me for a long time, and having the chance to let other people hear about my game is an incredible gift you gave me.  Thanks, Rob.  I had a blast, man.  <br/><br/>And as for all of the people that listened to the podcast, thank you for checking it out!  I hope you were entertained by our conversation.  And if you found you were also interested in Criminal Element, then that's all the better.  Also, I'm very, very sorry that my laughter is so loud.  I'll try harder next time, I swear.  <br/><br/>I guess I should also say that if anyone has any questions about my game or the interview, I'm hanging out right now, beer in hand and completely willing to answer some stuff.

It makes it so much more understandable to your brain than having both voices in both speakers. I haven't noticed that on your shows, but I'll listen closer. So you aren't using all four of the microphones on your Zoom H2?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140502/#Comment_140502" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-19T14:43:53+00:00" title="April 19, 2008  2:43PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm using two-channel (right and left) bidirectional (front and back), though not four-channel (a separate mic for each of the four directions) because no one will be listening to a show on something that can process four separate streams.

I can't wait to take it for a spin.</blockquote>\nHey, Nicholas!  Great to "see" you 'round these parts as well.  It was a great time playing with you and your wife, as well as everyone else in that crew.  Your feedback at the end of the session was really useful as well.  <br/><br/>As for you playing the game, go ahead man!  I'd love to hear some feedback from you about your experiences with the game.  And hey, it's free right now, so you can't really beat the price.  <br/>\n<blockquote>I see that trust was dropped we never did use it at Dreamation did we?</blockquote>\nYeah, the Trust mechanic was dead weight.  I had been considering dropping it before Dreamation, and when I played with the crew you were in that pretty much clinched it.  Instead, I'm refocusing on Vices and how they impact play.  \n<blockquote>Most likely I will be demoing this for friends soonish.. Any advice? What Movie should I ask them to watch?</blockquote>\nThe first bit of advice I can give is to wait another week until I have the Shotgun Bible, my beta playtest, posted.  That'll have a lot of tips on how to play the game in it, stuff I've learned at my own table.  How to manage scenes and keep the pace fast and all of that good stuff.  It'll also be reorganized so that it should be a pretty fun, light read with tons of dialogue that'll set the mood for gameplay, as well as bunches of examples.  <br/><br/>Pimping aside, my best advice is to put together a group of at three to five players that are up for the tension and struggle that is inherent to a good heist story.  I make no bones about the fact that CE isn't written for dysfunctional gaming groups.  The game is about desire and bullets.  Players have to know that going in.  <br/><br/>As for inspirational movies... start with the one that inspired me the most: Heat.  Michael Mann directing Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro in one of my all-time favourite films, and a cornerstone of the heist film genre.  If you had to pick one movie to ask your crew to watch, it's Heat, hands down.  If you guys are itching for more heist movies after your sessions of CE, I would suggest Sexy Beast, Killing Zoe, Reservoir Dogs, the director's cut version of Payback, The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, Charlie Varrick, Inside Man, and a metric assload more.  \n<blockquote>Also do what Con's do you plan on attending this year?</blockquote>\nWell, DexCon is definitely in the mix, as is PhilCon.  Beyond that, I really want to go to GenCon but probably won't be able to afford it, what with trying to publish a book at the end of the year and all.  After the book is published, or at least an ashcan is out, then I'll be much more mobile in terms of convetioneering.  How's about yourself, man?<br/><br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>Clyde,<br/><br/>Your laughter is infectious. Don't apologize!</blockquote>\nThanks, Rob.
