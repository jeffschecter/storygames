I'm specifically referring to the early Dragon Ball. While I don't object to Dragon Ball Z as much as many people do, the earlier stuff seems easier to work with, and would be a much easier sell to my gaming group. I want to do a game about a bunch of friends having wacky adventures looking for magic stones that can grant a wish, in a world with weird martial artists, \u201cHoipoi Capsules\u201d that fit in the palm of your hand but can contain cars or houses, animal people, dinosaurs, magical mysteries, and so on.<br/><br/>I have no idea what system to use though. I want something that makes the wacky characters and occasional wacky powers interesting, and that is good for light-hearted player-led adventures. I want to avoid the excesses of fightiness and power level (in the first chapter Bulma freaks out and <b>shoots Goku in the face</b>, but it just stings), and concentrate on the fun adventure and wonder of the setting.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deckard" title="Deckard"><img alt="Deckard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deckard">Deckard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189033/#Comment_189033" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T11:01:36+00:00" title="January 19, 2009 11:01AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, you really wanna play Crisis Trigger.

It would certainly violate Solar's dictum that even the weakest can sometimes beat the strongest. Though I could see a Solar Dragon Ball game that ran long enough become rather DBZish as players accumulate greater and greater Secrets (and Goku would totally have the Secret of the Bodhisavatta after coming back from the dead!) But I doubt that'd be sustainably fun. You'd definitely hit the ceiling of the Solar System power framework early on.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189424/#Comment_189424" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T13:16:41+00:00" title="January 21, 2009  1:16PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about a PDQ system?

Characters seldom die, but when they do get hurt, short of some deus ex machina (Senzu beans, etc.) they will actually feel it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deckard</cite>So, you really wanna play Crisis Trigger.

Didn't play in DB universe as such, but had something very familiar in style but more fantasy-like, used Fuzion for that \u2014 kinda own dialect, heavily inspired by that Animechanix book you're certainly familiar with, plus I did specify the martial arts schools in more detail and divided all possible techniques in Crane Path, Turtle Path, etc. Didn't help much in the story sense, but the fights were fun, with a hell lot of dice being rolled.<br/><br/>If you found/made a game system helping to run games specificly in the style of early Dragon Ball, Kenyu Densetsu Yaiba and the like, that would be pretty cool actually.
