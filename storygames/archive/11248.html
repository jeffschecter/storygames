And that rocks.<br/><br/>As John kinda gets at, trust your instincts and Mouse Guard will take you there.  Don't think the game is trying to make you do stuff that is stupid or not right for your group.  The game is smarter than that.  Trust yourselves first and then trust that the game will support you in the game experience you're trying to create.  I mean, you know IN YOUR HEAD that just telling the players to roll Pathfinder is lame, right?<br/><br/>Assuming you already know how to have fun playing with a group of folks, Mouse Guard will support you in doing that, and in ways that you'll like.<br/><br/>The only problems I've seen is when people try to follow the mechanics and structural guidelines really mechanically, without letting things flow together.  Like "we just finished the Weather Obstacle 3, so now better roll out my Mouse Obstacle 4." I think that comes from discomfort and trying to figure out what Secret Master Procedures the text is telling you to do, as if it was something alien and unusual.  Do all the planning that the game recommends and definitely use the procedures it describes, but, once play begins, listen to your players, pay attention to what's happening at the table, not what's written in the book, and you'll be gold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/netwomble" title="netwomble"><img alt="netwomble" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh6.google.com/netwomble/R5fup6Cz6tI/AAAAAAAABIQ/mSl7x0gzHo0/s144/Womble_logo_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/netwomble">netwomble</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249879/#Comment_249879" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-06T18:45:20+00:00" title="January  6, 2010  6:45PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Say what's in front of them,<i>then ask them what they do</i>, then say what the test is.</blockquote>\nThat's really good advice, and I don't want to detract from that. (Imma let you finish...)<br/><br/>But,<br/><br/>I've just got Mouse Guard myself and a cursory read through the book suggests that the GM sets up the obstacle and the check required to pass it. Players can suggest alternatives, but the GM is supposed to stop them from twisting each situation so that they always use their strong skills.<br/><br/>Mind you, I haven't read it closely yet, just bounced around it, so I'm talking overall impression, I can't quote examples.<br/><br/>Regardless of what the text actually says, I think I will be more open with the obstacles. Primarily because I'm too lazy to figure out how one should overcome the problem.

If the players are new to the game, point out opportunities to earn checks by nerfing themselves.  That's when things get really interesting.<br/><br/>Be an asshole about player checks.  Obey the economy strictly.  If players want to earn the right to direct the narrative, they have to earn checks.  There's this wonderful MG dynamic where all the players are trying to nerf themselves during the GM turn, which makes the group dysfunctional as all hell.  Our GM WIlhelm was very eager to inflict 'angry' conditions on our mice when we nerfed ourselves into clear fail territory.  <br/><br/>Then, during the player turn everyone gets to go do the stuff they really want to do ... write beautiful poetry, woo sexxxy civilian-mice, intrigue the patrol management, whatever.  So we had this beautiful cycle of mission play and subplot with lots of intraparty grouchiness to flavor it.  That is the essence of Mouse Guard to me.<br/><br/>Challenge the hell out of helper dice; don't allow lame ones.  Wil is pretty strict about these and it really makes the game much more flavorful.<br/><br/>Get a really good grip on the extended challenge system.  It's not very simple and will take some practice for the players to come up to speed on it.  Maybe facilitate the learning curve by frontloading some low-ob high-disposition challenges.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249898/#Comment_249898" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T01:10:43+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  1:10AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2010 1:11AM by rafial.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnzo said pretty much everything I would have, but I will add this: also be pest about requiring some fiction to go with skill uses, helper dice &amp; challenge maneuvers.

Does that come from somewhere?<br/><br/>Kevin, one of the things you can do to mitigate the carebear optimization impulse is to ensure that the game proceeds along fun lines regardless of the outcomes of the rolls.  I think this is in the RAW, but make sure you don't call for any kind of random engagement if you don't have fun in mind for all possible outcomes.  This might be common wisdom now but I wanted to mention it.<br/><br/>The receipt of an advancement fail-dot for a bad skill roll is another thing that deadens the Opitimize-A-Lot bear impulse.<br/><br/>Also, if the patrol is unable to rally in a single direction, look to the leader to put some direction to it. Our table bought into the leader idea, so when our leader told us to do something, we snapped to it.  And our leader did a superb job, only really pushing us when we needed that push to keep the game from stalling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249978/#Comment_249978" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T14:12:57+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  2:12PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's one of the things I try to keep in mind about Mouse Guard: The Environment is a character and he's the worst, cruelest more horrible villain you can imagine.<br/><br/>Practically don't play Wilderness/Weather Obstacles/Twists "realistically" play them with cunning intelligence as if they had it out for the Mouse Guard personally.

(Imma let you finish...)<br/><br/>But,<br/><br/>I've just got Mouse Guard myself and a cursory read through the book suggests that the GM sets up the obstacle and the check required to pass it. Players can suggest alternatives, but the GM is supposed to stop them from twisting each situation so that they always use their strong skills.<br/><br/>Hi Aaron. Basically, as you note, what the text says is that the GM must provide an Obstacle and the means of tackling that obstacle; the GM may also provide an alternative and the players may also make suggestions.<br/><br/>Imagine I'm the GM and your patrol has to retrieve the prisoners from a weasel slave raid. I describe your patrol's approach to the cave where the prisoners are being held and the bored weasel guards keeping an eye on it. I tell you that it's going to be a versus Scout test to sneak into the cave without alerting the weasels.<br/><br/>At that point, you can say, "Screw sneaking. I ready my halberd and walk right up to them and tell them in a low, gravelly voice that they better get out of here now, or I'm going drag their skulls back to Lockhaven to use as planters. Can I use Deceiver to intimidate them into running away?"<br/><br/>As the GM, I can then agree to your suggestion and let you proceed with the Deceiver test. Or I can decide the test is inappropriate; there's no way these picked guards are going to run from you. It's going to be a Fight Conflict instead.<br/><br/>All of that is perfectly kosher with the rules as written.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Richie" title="Richie"><img alt="Richie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Richie">Richie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250025/#Comment_250025" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-08T00:54:28+00:00" title="January  8, 2010 12:54AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think our biggest struggle was coming to terms with player's turn vs gm's turn.

The obstacle setting advice in the skill list (counting up the factors that apply) is even harder...you'll wind up with REALLY hard obs...like even harder than than table suggests they should be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dice system is pretty easy to guestimate odds...with average luck you should be able to score successes equal to 1/2 the dice you're rolling.  With a small number of dice going 2-3 Ob above this rapidly gets in the "most likely to fail" category.  This then can lead into players frantically trying to finangle every single extra die they can...such as everyone giving aid dice for every single roll based on increasingly preposterous ideas..."I help fight the weasel with my Geology-wise by throwing a rock at it"  This also means that players can be extremely reluctant to hose themselves for Checks because losing a die or two can turn a roll from "not likely" to "forget about it".<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Really take advantage of the "Win anyway but suffer this Condition" effect.<br/>\n2) Really take advantage of the "Fail but here's a Twist that even's more fun than winning would have been" effect.<br/>\n-- These two are the key drivers of the resolution system.  Without it...whiff-tastic.<br/>\n3) Make sure you demonstrate the above to your players so that they know they don't need to play "weasel out every die I can get" games constantly...which can rapidly become unfun for everyone.<br/>\n4) This may be heretical, but you won't go too wrong in your first session shaving an Ob point off of most tests.<br/>\n-- IMO in the quest to ensure there's enough failure to drive the Conditions and Twists system, and enough failure to make players feel that they are mice...weak and small even if they are heroic...the rules err on the side of "slightly too hard" mathematically.  I would rather reduce all the Obs by 1 across the board permanently and then ruthlessly weed out all but the most meaningful and justifiable helping dice.  As it is it can start to feel rather gloomy when your mouse is only good at one thing, and even at that one thing he fails far more often than he succeeds.<br/>\n5) Related to all this, make sure that the things you're asking for rolls for...are suitably meaningful.  MG is not a game where you should ever ask for casual tests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250108/#Comment_250108" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-08T14:27:29+00:00" title="January  8, 2010  2:27PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph,<br><br>Huh.

So you can make the tester Angry and everyone who helped is Hungry, for instance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doho123" title="doho123"><img alt="doho123" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doho123">doho123</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353925/#Comment_353925" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T11:00:35+00:00" title="January 11, 2012 11:00AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

Instead I either tell them how awesome they did, or ask them to describe their awesome win, and then let them know that the exertion left them tired, or angry or sick, but they totally brought it.<br/><br/>To the OP: As for calling for tests, don't be afraid to call out what test is required yourself, don't be afraid to ask what the patrol is doing and then tell them what test matches their intent, and don't be afraid to start with one test and shift to another based on developments in the game. I've used each approach successfully depending on context.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: doho123</cite><br/>Hmmm, I've wondered about that.
