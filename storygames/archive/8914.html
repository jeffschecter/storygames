You understand? They call it an MMO or they don't, but what if you were to try and replicate the experience (you know, as much as possible) of playing an MMO at the table? This would be a "beer and pretzels" RPG, with probably little real RP to speak of*. You would take 4e and do what 4e does best (sweet combat), while simulating the feel of an MMO by having mechanics for things like Instances, Raids, Mining/Gathering, etc.<br/><br/>the one mechanic I have in mind, that came along with the epiphany: Limit the number of letter-characters a player can use when naming his/her character, just like an MMO, so you get crazy-ass unpronounceable MMO names. Like, "This is a rule: Come up with a phrase that describes your character concept. You must somehow incorporate that phrase into a name for your character that is no more than 8 letters long."<br/><br/>Example: "Final Fantasy V is awesome! I want to play a bard. I name him <b>SPNY_BRD</b>."<br/><br/>Between this and Spelljammer come words I wasn't sure I'd ever say: I really want to play D&amp;D 4e!<br/><br/>Thoughts? Reactions? Suggestions?<br/><br/><br/>*So why am I posting this to Story Games? Well, even though the mechanics aren't there to support story, this idea is completely informed by all I've read on indie game design and a lot of ideas that get thrown around here. It just feels to me like this fits here. If it really doesn't, please take this down, Andy.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196907/#Comment_196907" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-13T22:31:51+00:00" title="March 13, 2009 10:31PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It could be fun I suppose.

So there's this thing where the world is like the one you've described, and there's no separation between player and character, and the mechanics reinforce the feel of that world while keeping it fun. Like, mining by just rolling a bunch of dice over and over is boring, but come up with a cool mini-game mechanic for it? It's fun, and you're playing with the tropes at the same time. It's a gonzo, shoot-the-dice and crack jokes game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196924/#Comment_196924" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-14T08:26:46+00:00" title="March 14, 2009  8:26AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have always rather thought that the feel of MMO's are rather a result of the game rather than a aim of it. <br/><br/>Its not going to feel like a MMO until you sitting arround the tavern and theirs some n00b begging for 30gp to get their next x and then someone yells SELLING X FOR X and then lots of people get into completely ooc and unrelated discussions, and someone does nothing but say<br/><br/>FAGFAGFAGFAGFAGFAGFAGFAG<br/><br/>over and over again. <br/><br/>Logos                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196925/#Comment_196925" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-14T08:28:58+00:00" title="March 14, 2009  8:28AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it has some potential.

The main characters (PCs: all or some of them) somehow lose the ability to log out.
