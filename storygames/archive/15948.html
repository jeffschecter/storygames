So hello :P<br/><br/>I'm here basically to spam about a little new game I wrote yesterday. Even if it's quite "young" as a game, it curiously has been playtested already a couple of times, this night, by a friend of mine.<br/><br/>The game is named <b>111 mph</b>. Its original name was 180 Km/h, but translating it to english I changed also the notation. That's more or less the speed at which stabilizes a human body in free fall, according to wikipedia.<br/><br/><b>111 mph</b> infact is a small rpg (I <i>think</i> I can call it a RPGpoem...) for 2 players about a parachutist whose parachute doesn't open (so now you understand why it's a fast game...). He cannot but think of his whole life, which is passing in front of his eyes for 5 minutes, before he splats to the ground.<br/><br/>One of the players is the parachutist, and will have 5 minutes to answer 40 questions asked by the other player. Every time he vacillates, he starts over (the timer will go on, obviously).<br/><br/>In the game experience I imagined the situation should be so frenetic that, after a while, the parachutist stops inventing things, to gain time, and starts answering with his personal facts. I don't know the correct term to describe this situation; in Italy we just say that when you merge this way with your character you're entering in the <i>unsafe</i> part of the game experience. I think that comes from a book by Graham Walmsley, but I'm not sure.<br/><br/>There's not much else to say: here's the download link (you'll be redirected by a black screen which is needed for the download counter to work): <a href="http://revanadler.altervista.org/trashmeetssteel/DN_180_eng.php" rel="nofollow">http://revanadler.altervista.org/trashmeetssteel/DN_180_eng.php</a><br/><br/>If you're interested in my other games (they all are in ITA, though, except for Brachininae...) here's the production page from my blog: <a href="http://trashmeetssteel.blogspot.com/p/produzioni.html" rel="nofollow">http://trashmeetssteel.blogspot.com/p/produzioni.html</a><br/><br/>The number of questions in the game and the timing will probably be revised after several playtests, so if you play it please let me know about it <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362860/#Comment_362860" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T05:48:50+00:00" title="February 27, 2012  5:48AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome Alex!<br/><br/>I really like this! It's a very simple roleplaying poem that promises to be quite challenging and intense in practice.
