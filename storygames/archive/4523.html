More brainstorming ... though maybe I've made the question too focussed to be fun :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going to have a game that uses playing cards.  Each player will start out with a personal deck of one suit (e.g. the thirteen <i>hearts</i> cards) which they will deal out as follows:  A foundation of five cards, side by side, covered by a next layer of four-cards half-offset (so the middle of a card in the next layer is on the joined edges of a card on the layer below) and somewhat "up" on the table.  Then a next layer of three, same-same.  So, a pyramid, basically.  The spare card goes in an area in the center.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople will be turning cards from face-down to face-up, moving them into the center, taking them back, etc., etc.  They will probably end up having other people put cards of other suits into their pyramid, and likewise put some of theirs into other people's.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven all the features of cards that I'm already planning to use for other things, I'm looking at the <i>remaining</i> features, and wondering the following:  Can I figure out a way of "reading" those features such that the following conditions apply:<br/>\n<br/>\n(a) The cards can be arranged in a way that is objectively <i>better</i> than the typical random draw.<br/>\n(b) The cards can be arranged in a way that is objective <i>worse</i> than the typical random draw.<br/>\n(c) The transition from one to another is a gradual build-up as you switch cards in and out ... changing one card doesn't slam you from perfect to pitiful, or vice versa.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here's my first contribution to what I hope will be <i>many</i> ways of doing this:  Sort-order.  Cards that start with a low value and ascend (left to right) toward higher values are GOOD.  Cards that start with a high value and descend (left to right) toward lower values are BAD.  I think it meets the criteria ... yes?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102500/#Comment_102500" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T12:42:55+00:00" title="October 11, 2007 12:42PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the answer is yes, but let me make sure I have this right.<br><br>I have thirteen spades.<br><br>I build my pyramid thusly:<br><br>Base row is: 3 6 4 2 Ace.<br>Second row is: King Queen 10 9<br>Third row is: Jack 5<br>Top card is: 7<br>Spare card is: 8<br><br>Now, I start swapping cards around with my pals...we apply the rule that cards that start with a low value and ascend towards higher values are 'good'...<br/><br/>If I switch out the 5 of spades for a Queen of Clubs, my third row is now: Jack Queen, that is better.<br/><br/>If I switch out the 4 and 2 for a 7 and 9, I now have 3 6 7 9 Ace, which is better.<br/><br/>If I decide to make things worse I can switch the 6 and 4 for a 3 and a 2, making it: 3 3 2 2 Ace...<br/><br/>It would take the most effort to switch my second row from being bad to good, in other words, if a big row is already bad, it will take a lot of work to make it good, and if it is good, it will take a lot of work to make it bad.<br/><br/>So I think this fulfills your three criteria.<br/><br/>If I understand it?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102509/#Comment_102509" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T13:20:06+00:00" title="October 11, 2007  1:20PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If having more of a single row in one suit, or one colour, is good, then that probably fits too.<br/><br/>However, your single card at the top is still kind of irrelevant with either option.

Going from 7 to 8 is just as good as going from 7 to 6, and much better than going from 2 to 10.<br/><br/>The math gets annoying with face cards, though, so consider changing how they function.<br/><br/>Also, consider handling the "rows" differently--instead of left to right, they could go up and down the sides of the pyramid.<br/><br/>Together, that gives us the possibility of setting up "straights", "flushes", or "runs"--if you can trace a path along a row, or up/down on of the sides of a pyramid that has consecutively ordered cards, your pyramid gains value.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103029/#Comment_103029" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T16:27:25+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  4:27PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.  <i>Intersecting</i> straights, flushes and runs ... since each card is part of two rows, one slanted to the right, one slanted to the left.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103038/#Comment_103038" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T17:20:35+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  5:20PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that it would be really interesting to do things with matching sets.  It dramatically increases the interactiveness of the game, since getting cards from other players is the only way to make a set.  You'd have to look at what they've already got before giving them a card, too, to make sure you're not giving them a set.  Also, it makes the positioning of the cards important, since it's impossible to build a full row of matched cards on your bottom row, but you can get maximum points if you put it on your second one.  Will you go for four, or three?  On the other hand, making matched sets <i>bad</i> could be fun too, since it gives the other players a way to hinder you by which card they give you.  <br/><br/>It would be neat if building certain configurations of cards triggered an in-game effect, so that if (for example) you built a row of one of each suit, you could pick all those cards up and rearrange them in some way.  Having intermediate goals, or alternative goals is fun.  I like in "Hearts" how there's always that risk that the player who just keeps getting tricks is suddenly going to pull out some powerful cards and take them all, and suddenly be <i>winning</i> rather than losing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
