Will made Cutpurse Bob Hatchet, the quartermaster, and Adam made Julian the Apostate, the sailing master.  Julian's ambitions were to spit in the eye of God, to spit in the eye of the devil, and to be pardoned.  Cutpurse Bob had a ton of ambitions, also including pardoning.  I figured the game would end messily with some friendly King's Agents to offer bargains.  FALSE.  Julian was Accursed, and this basically drove the whole game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first scene, Adam realized that all his attributes were too close together, and he couldn't make any rolls reliably.  So, when the assassin Tom Reed slashed open his face with a knife, he gave up his ambition to be pardoned: "with a face like this, how can I ever lead a normal life?  A pirate I will be forever!"<br/>\n<br/>\nFor reasons unclear, no one wanted to be captain.  Cutpurse Bob assumed this position reluctantly when it became clear that the rudderless ship would be helpless without one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pirates sought a beach to get supplies and find a new cook.  I showed them a beautiful native woman cooking a feast for her family, but they didn't seriously consider abducting her.  Instead, they decided to press-gang the head cook from the next ship they raided. <br/>\n<br/>\nChef: Please, let me go.  I have a family back in port.<br/>\nJulian: You'll make more money with us in a month than you would in a year in honest work.<br/>\nCutpurse Bob: And if you say no, we'll kill you.<br/>\n<br/>\nA strong recruitment pitch!<br/>\n<br/>\nBetrayal raised its ugly head when boarding the merchant ship of the dutch halfwit Jan van Rootwinkle (brinksmanship 1).  Assuming the fight to be a cakewalk, Julian elected to stay back aboard ship without telling anyone.  Van Rootwinkle's men won by a single success, killing most of the pirates and capturing the rest, including the captain.  While Cap'n Bob struggled to escape the brig, van Rootwinkle's men crossed back over to engage Julian on the pirate ship, who was picking them off with his long rifle.  Glutted on Xs from his piratey excess, Julian and the deckhands captured the lot of them through clever tactics and sheer brutality.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this juncture it Bob's player decided that Julian's curse was making it impossible for him to pursue his own ends, and both pirates elected to break the curse as quickly as possible.  Before they were able to reach land, however, curse-induced madness overtook the ship.  Believing themselves to be pursued by the demon whale, Leviathan, a series of fights ensued.  Although Cutpurse Bob broke free of the madness, he only succeeded in hindering Julian, who believed the ship to be swallowed by the whale and dragged down to hell.  After giving in a fight with a company of damned souls in the whale's mouth, Julian suffered damnation and was tortured for eternity.  He eventually snapped out of the madness, but not before exercising his opportunity to spit in the eye of the devil in the most literal fashion possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, Julian and Cutpurse Bob confonted the voodoo queen Madame Juste, who offered to lift the curse if Julian would bring her her father's skull and repent of his many sins, begging god for forgiveness.  There was a long moment while Julian considered his options.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulian: Does repenting make it easier to lift the curse?<br/>\nMadame Juste: Not really, but it does make things more interesting.<br/>\nJulian: You know what?  I am SICK and TIRED of you damned skull-worshippers telling me how I should be a good Christian!<br/>\n<br/>\nJulian drew his sword to fight Madame Juste and her zombi bodyguards.  Cutpurse Bob, still smarting from Julian's betrayal earlier and reasoning that the curse would end with Julian's death, betrayed Julian and ran out.  Madame Juste beat Julian by a single success and slew him.  Julian rolled to come back as an accursing ghost and just barely failed, but since it was the end of the session and the poetic justice was too delicious, we allowed it, and with his dying breath Julian cursed Cutpurse Bob.  Fin.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, it was a fun game, but more difficult to run than I'd anticipated - the pace was frenetic.  I think it would have worked better with more players and maybe some intra-party strife.  We had a bunch of rules questions of various stripes, which I've posted to the Q&amp;A thread in the lumpley forum.  Adam enjoyed the game, but Will seemed dissatisfied.  I think he felt constrained by the lack of more general resolution mechanics for when his pirate was being honest and friendly.  Adam was more accepting of the need for everything to be resolved either by fighting or by the four piratey methods (treachery/deceit, violence against the unsuspecting or helpless, enduring duress, going into danger).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94467/#Comment_94467" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T15:19:41+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  3:19PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ignotus</cite>... swallowed by the whale and dragged down to hell.</blockquote>\nYes.
