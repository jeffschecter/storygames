At that point, three of the players around the table said, one after another, 'I hate Wither'.<br/><br/>The point they had was that Wither, when cast on a PC, was like an instant 'completely screw over the character' move - that just had to succeed on a dark roll (and a 10+ allows the Witch to keep it there as long as they like). Also that Hex casting was a regular move to be taken for other characters (as the Infernal had here).<br/><br/>The suggestion was made afterwards that perhaps Hex casting could be nerfed so that:<br/>- the caster always needs to use a sympathetic token to Hex (i.e. you remove the section about them being able to Hex face to face) - this would also mean that other skins have to take 2 Witch moves to use hexes in normal situations<br/>- unless the caster is Darkest self in which they can use face to face and sympathetic tokens (thus keeping the terrifying monster aspect of the Witch's darkest self)<br/><br/>Are there any other ways that you've used to either narratively or legislatively reduced or limited Hex casting?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424504/#Comment_424504" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T14:20:38+00:00" title="November 20, 2013  2:20PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you show the consequences of it's use?

Whatever the specifics it's bad.<br/><br/>So, technically no mechanical effect though in narrative it could screw you over. Most likely on the social level and how people react to you. Of course are the effects temporary or curable? That is is for the group to decide, and might make a good sub-plot in the story or campaign. <br/><br/>In addition many of the skins could be given in-story reasons to make such an ailment temporary. Do your Vampires regenerate? Do werewolves and Ghouls do the same? Can your infernal make a dark pact to be healed? Does the Chosen's library have a cure and a way to ward off future badness? Can a Ghost truly be maimed in such a way more than temporarily? Is the Fey's body so infused with Glamour that it can be healed by a trip to the Wyld? <br/><br/>Granted a few of the skins are harder to come up with ways to circumvent the ill effects. Also, of note is that in-story if you do something like that you have basically painted a big target on yourself. Which is awesome! Cause now you have the PC's working at odds to each other strewing their drama and messy lives all over and catching poor bystanders in the fallout.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424519/#Comment_424519" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T19:45:47+00:00" title="November 20, 2013  7:45PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Players who build their Monsterhearts characters combatively\u2014as in, building their characters to be able to harm others severely and never suffer serious physical damage or retribution\u2014will generally succeed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424522/#Comment_424522" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T20:18:25+00:00" title="November 20, 2013  8:18PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Try explaining it this way: <br/><br/>Anyone can go down to Walmart, buy a big kitchen knife, and then cut someone's face open with a volatile roll.

The fundamental truth about PVP Monsterhearts is that everyone is a glass cannon who you need to kill up to three times in a session to truly kill.

Blank Canvas lets you free yourself of the mechanical side-effects of the condition, but only by owning it. Think, like... "They think I'm a bitch, eh? I'll show them just how much of a bitch I really am!"<br/><br/>So, if you're a Serpentine and give a Hollow the condition <i>Snake Food</i>, sure, they can drop the condition... but only by accepting their role in the story as your prey on a level that explicitly influences their sense of self. The "fluff" of the move, which is just as concretely a part of the rules as the mechanical bits, is that you're a bit of a nonperson, more easily influenced by other people's perceptions, desires, and expectations of you on a deep and fundamental level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424913/#Comment_424913" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-28T10:07:08+00:00" title="November 28, 2013 10:07AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Depends on the condition being inflicted.

If you cast Wither in person, chanting in tongues, you're likely to suffer some pretty serious consequences. The Witch is all about delayed vengeance, and any time a Witch is casting spells in the moment it's bound to end up poorly for them.<br/><br/>Let's say I stare at you and chant in tongues. The MC says, "Yeah, I think your hair falls out, and your teeth start to ache. What do you do?" Your reaction is not going to be pretty.<br/><br/>Mechanically: Wither doesn't typically do harm (though I can imagine an MC deciding that it does 1-harm based on circumstance), and the PC isn't in charge of the specific effects. It's got the potential to ruin someone physically, but it's probably going to trigger a spiral of reactions.<br/><br/>Wither and Binding are both really powerful spells, but if a Witch is casting them in person it probably won't end well for them. If you're MCing, it's your job to make sure that's true.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425072/#Comment_425072" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-02T18:53:15+00:00" title="December  2, 2013  6:53PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Lula">@Lula</a>, I'm describing an arms race where everyone reaches for a big gun <em>in self defence</em>.

On the other hand, "Truth and Lies" (i.e. Ring of Lies and Illusions) works very well as thematic magic for a Fae taking an advance, "Haunt and Possess" (Illusions and Watching*) work pretty well for a ghost (depending what the table agrees happens to the ghost's body especially if you have dissipate), and Infernals sometimes learn magic not entirely dependent on their Dark Power.<br/><br/>*No, it's not a true possession.  The ghost can't control the possessed - at least not if they are awake.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AllanDotson" title="AllanDotson"><img alt="AllanDotson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/587/nCEFJQOAECTHQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AllanDotson">AllanDotson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425130/#Comment_425130" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-03T12:52:43+00:00" title="December  3, 2013 12:52PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So many thoughts on this.  I should preface all this by saying that I love Monsterhearts, it's a truly beautiful game, but I haven't actually played or run it yet.  <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">@EpistolaryRichard</a>, I can completely understand why your players might hate Wither.  Not because of any mechanical effects, but because of the way it rewrites your character description, seemingly permanently.  It makes you ugly, in a game about sexy teen romance.  I know a lot of players would not like having their character concept altered like that, and I can appreciate why.  If my character concept is the beautiful popular Queen, and now she's yellow, spotty, and bald, it's like I've lost the character I wanted to play.  It's way worse than any amount of Harm, and the rules don't give you any way to heal from it.  \n<blockquote>Anyone can go down to Walmart, buy a big kitchen knife, and then cut someone's face open with a volatile roll.</blockquote>\nThis opens a whole other can of worms.  Anyone <i>can</i> cut someone's face open (or cut out eyes, tongue, fingers, etc.), but most players wouldn't do it to another PC.  Not, I think, because of the consequences to their character, but because of a social contract that you respect other players' characters, that they control their own actions and description.<br/><br/>In most games I run, if a player wants to cut out someone's eye, tongue, fingers, etc., I would likely say "This game doesn't give any rules for cutting off someone's fingers, the violence is abstracted as Harm.  Let's not go there."  The Wither move seems to suggest that we do go there.  It puts permanently disfiguring or maiming another PC on the table.  <br/><br/>What should Wither actually be able to do?  The examples listed in the move (hair falls out, teeth <i>start to</i> rot, blotchy, yellow skin), are all pretty minor, cosmetic, and not necessarily permanent.  But the example of Wither in the book has the Witch making someone's tongue fall out.  If you made a PC unable to talk, they would become much weaker and harder to play, and it sure sounds permanent (barring a magical intervention there are no rules for).  This is an extreme example of a Witch in Darkest Self against an NPC, but what should Wither be able to do to a PC?<br/> <br/>When you inflict Harm on someone (say with a big kitchen knife), can you also describe a permanent disfigurement or physical impairment that you give them?  If you cut out their eyes, tongue, or fingers, do we treat that as a condition, or make a custom move for them?  Does that disfigurement or disability heal like Harm or conditions do, or can it only heal by in-fiction magical intervention?  \n<blockquote>In addition many of the skins could be given in-story reasons to make such an ailment temporary. Do your Vampires regenerate? Do werewolves and Ghouls do the same? Can your infernal make a dark pact to be healed? Does the Chosen's library have a cure and a way to ward off future badness? Can a Ghost truly be maimed in such a way more than temporarily? Is the Fey's body so infused with Glamour that it can be healed by a trip to the Wyld? </blockquote>\nIf some Skins can regenerate from permanent disfiguring wounds (whether from Withering or from big kitchen knives), and others can't, those Skins become much more powerful.  Are the Skins meant to be equal in power?  \n<blockquote>But that's an extreme action that will, one would hope, provoke a lot of consequences. Doing so with spooky dark magic? Even more so! I mean "local teens' faces mysteriously melt off" is the kind of news that attracts attention I suspect the Infernal would not appreciate.</blockquote>\nOkay, so there's a spiral of reactions, and it's not going to end well for the Witch, but that doesn't help the PC who got Withered.<br/><br/>It seems to me that what makes Wither so nasty is that it's permanent (or seems to be).  I would probably treat it like a condition, and allow it to be healed as a condition.  Does that risk making it too weak?<br/><br/>(I can also see how Hypnosis is just as bad, if not worse, because it doesn't give any limits to the service the Vampire can demand.  As written, it seems like the Vampire can command you to "serve me forever", or "cut off your own hands".  And if they get a 7-9, you still do it, only now you're crazy too!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken" title="Troels Ken"><img alt="Troels Ken" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken">Troels Ken</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425134/#Comment_425134" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-03T13:02:07+00:00" title="December  3, 2013  1:02PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel that this is stating the fairly obvious, but here goes:<br/><br/>It's not a game about balance.

Breaking lines of consent is an important part of the Vampire Skin, and that move is central to it.

Also I guess the petty nature of the vengeance doesn't sit comfortably with the level of the punishment in the fiction.<br/><br/>We tend to play fairly na\xefve games where the existence of monsters is down played, in most of the games I've played each monster has initially imagined it was alone in being monstrous among its classmates and so the concept of instance revenge and escalating violence hasn't really happened. Also, often, the skins involved include some fairly mundane options, there's not a lot a Mortal or a Queen can do to directly retaliate against an attack like that, even if it happens right in front of them. Also, most of the games are either one shots, or two to three sessions where again the concept of creating a side plot to undo the spell doesn't really work with the pacing and if that becomes the 'must do thing' for a character whose beauty is a major aspect then it risks taking them out of the rest of the game somewhat.<br/><br/>As it stands I'm on the 'not a fan' side of things, I know there is the 'monsters as superheroes' style of Monsterhearts play where things can escalate quickly, but I'm much more on the 'monsters as tortured teenagers' side of things, as such if someone casts Wither on my character, they are much more likely to curl up in a ball, or run away than escalate back, similarly if they were slashed across the face with a knife they would probably look on in shock trying to work out what happened and why rather than grin and announce 'bring it on'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425178/#Comment_425178" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-04T05:00:03+00:00" title="December  4, 2013  5:00AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I feel that this is stating the fairly obvious, but here goes:<br/><br/>It's not a game about balance.

There was a real chance she'd die, though there's the Darkest Self option. I'm not sure that that actually breaks a hex, though, so it probably just buys a bit of time. Now, this was a fun game, and actually ended <i>almost</i> well for the characters, but I do see the issue with hexes. They can be done at a distance, for an indeterminate amount of time, leaving a character no real recourse.<br/><br/>So long as players are on the same page, so long as players and MC are good about finding ways for everyone to shine, this isn't a problem.
