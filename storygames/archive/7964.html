(Disclaimer: most IH games are board or strategy or logic games, but there IS one "narr" RPG and my own "trad" RPG that uses them.)<br/><br/>Simplest way to find the good ones are at this page:<br/><a href="http://icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=Existing_Games" rel="nofollow">http://icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=Existing_Games</a><br/>The Published Games and IGDC Winners and Placers are, generally, great.<br/><br/>Find a few you like--many only take ten or twenty minutes to play--then use this subsection:<br/><a href="http://icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=What_Can_I_Play%3F#Theme_and_Mechanics" rel="nofollow">http://icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=What_Can_I_Play%3F#Theme_and_Mechanics</a><br/>...to determine which other games have similar mechanics.<br/><br/>My personal "Top Ten" are (in no particular order):<br/>* Zendo - I have played Zendo in bars, at family gathers, and with total strangers at cons... and no single Icehouse game captures people's interest as much, period. *whisper* Don't tell anyone, but you can play it with matchbooks, Legos, playing cards--anything with a handful of physical characteristics and the ability to have several orientations. Thus, I most-often teach the game to folks with matchbooks at the pub--I don't tote around tubes of pyramids, no matter how "portable" the game system is (and it really is--if you make Zero Point Icehouse Pieces (ZPIPs), you can fit a full set of four stashes of fifteen pieces (0-2 pipers) in a Maglight Mini case or, basically, a pack of cigarettes).<br/><br/>* Armada - I love the simple miniature game element, and there's definitely fun to be had with the strategy--I play the variant where each side can field up to 15 pips worth of craft, of any size (using only one color). This is a lot more interesting than the Larges versus the Mids and Smalls (though the latter IS a single-stash game). Multiplayer is great--a bit of Diplomacy, a bit of mini madness--and it can be fun to put obstacles in the battle area (my favorite is to use tubes as "reefs") and to make "teleporters" (sci fi theme) with matched pairs of poker chips.<br/><br/>* Martian Chess - With Eeyore's Wedge Chessboard pieces, you can scale this game from 2 to 6 players, making for some VERY interesting multiplayer stuff. As a game, it can be tough to teach though--for the first couple of games, folks will ALWAYS try to move pieces that are no longer on their side/quadrant of the board, thinking in normal chess terms. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>* Pikemen - Same as MC above (but on a normal board, for 2 - 4 players). Good strategy board game--easy to learn, lifetime to mater; all that. Can be very tippy, with differing skill levels though, because of the "action at a distance' aspect--folks just don't notice their doom until too late.<br/><br/>* Subdivision - Second Place IGDC Summer 2007, but it really should have won. Great, great "city building" game for up to four players (and it really wants all four, or at least three). I played this for HOURS at DragonCon.<br/><br/>* Gnostica - The coolest game I've never played. Seriously--it's a powerhouse, but it takes a BIG commitment in time and practice, and my friends are commitment-phobic (and forget about it at a con). There's still a niche waiting for someone who can make easy-to-read cards with the rules on them (square ones, ideally), to replace the traditional Tarot cards.<br/><br/>* Martian Mud Wrestling - A solid two-player game, though it can get into "stuck" cycles, at times. Still, I can teach it in minutes and leave folks to play it for hours, doing demos.<br/><br/>* Martian Coasters - Actually kind of fun, though really light. There's a TON of games, though, based off the MCs (a product you'd have to buy for, IIRC, $4), including my own Wormholes (which, if I may say, is cool and much more involved than normal Martian Coasters).<br/><br/>* Moon Shot/Atom Smasher - Two of my own games, grouped because they basically both use dexterity exclusively to play, and so they have a very similar "feel." (Literally.) The first one is a sort of "shoot the moon" game, and the second is a lot like pool for pyramids. Heavily themed, for hilarity during play. Both middling performers in IGDCs (the Icehouse community is WAY skewed to strategy and logic games).<br/><br/>* Ice Towers - I play this more with Giant Pyramids (large = ~1.5' tall) than regular ones, at conventions. But it's a real crowd-pleaser, a bit tricky strategically, and easy to learn. Some dexterity required, and can result in tangled limbs if folks place towers too close to each other.<br/><br/>If you're really into pyramids, join the Looney labs mailing list--the Winter 2009 IGDC should be coming up shortly, in conversations:<br/><a href="http://lists.looneylabs.com/mailman/listinfo/icehouse" rel="nofollow">http://lists.looneylabs.com/mailman/listinfo/icehouse</a><br/><br/>And the wiki, as always, is yours to populate and explore. I'm fairly active on both (though I'm also a bit of a black sheep, because I often rail against the Looney's conservative business development--Icehouse and related products could make the very, very rich, if they'd trust their core player base and release a handful of products that we've called for for years--instead, they crank out Fluxx variants and win Origins awards for them, somehow). :P                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176110/#Comment_176110" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T14:28:29+00:00" title="October 24, 2008  2:28PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2008 2:28PM by Ludanto.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, thanks!<br/><br/>I've got an Ice House set that just sits on my shelf because I don't have many good games to play with it.

Again, being largely a demoer, it's REAL hard to get folks into a game like Homeworlds (even Binary). It suffers from two big issues:<br/>1) Analysis Paralysis - The number of options at game start and, generally, throughout play can overwhelm a beginner.<br/>2) Lot to Follow - It's very easy to have a "surprise" catastrophe (surprise for the victim... but often, also, for the perpetrator) because so much gets out on the table, after a few rounds.\n<blockquote><p>Anyone else find that playing in public brings out the nutters?</p></blockquote>\nEh, not so much. It might be because "everybody" knows me, in the pubs in which I occasionally break out stashes, and so I get a random mix of folks interested in them. If anything, they tend to bring out the less "gamer" of game-players--folks recognize that they must be some kind of game, but MAN it doesn't look anything like Scrabble or Monopoly! And kids... ah, yeah, the ($^*<a href="/forums/profile/%25%24%29">@%$)</a> kids.
