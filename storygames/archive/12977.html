It's threatening to turn into Indie Game Night at the store, so there's some pick-up play.  I'm glad there's more people, but it can sometimes intersect awkwardly with regular games.  There was someone who dropped in this week because he'd heard about the games going on, but our group was busy with AW.  Fortunately, other people showed up and he was able to get in a game.<br/><br/>Some people have used Meet-Up or the store's forum to try to put games together, with varying success.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292471/#Comment_292471" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T07:07:16+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  7:07AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a Google group for one game group and a regular ol' listserv for the other.

LOL I just read Jason's bit, this is in fact four entirely different groups. (the listserv name is "I Kill it with My Axe", which is kinda ironic given the new porn video blog D&amp;D thing is called "I Hit it with My Axe").<br/><br/>Anyway, those are the "established groups". Sometimes the google group, we're all kinda tech saavy so we sometimes use google calendar and the like to coordinate, but it hasn't done much for us. The google group itself is great though: We can post files, character sheets, house rules etc to it and keep it private.<br/><br/>As for play-dates with people that aren't part of a regular meetup group, there are two methods:<br/><br/>1) There's an RTP/RDU Meetup Group for Role-playing.  Lots of recruitment, lots of games. Very well organized, lots of enthusiasm. i've seen everything from AD&amp;D1e to Mouse Guard to Fiasco to Rolemaster get posted - and filled - within a day.<br/><br/>2) Primarily, though, we have a kind of yahoogroup for area hippie/small-press gamers in the RDU area. People post events to it, housecons, etc. Folks show up. We do 1-2 events a month using a local yahoogroup (or in modern era, google group). It's that easy. It's a private list, and when another interesting person in the area pops up on the radar who is a cool, stable person interested in gaming, we invite them to the list.<br/><br/>If I didn't have a regular game, nor access to the above two resources, I might try to organize through RPGNet or maybe The Forge/Conventions Forum: I've met awesome gamers through both and we continue to play to this day.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292492/#Comment_292492" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T08:17:38+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  8:17AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2010 8:18AM by jenskot.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in a few groups but many of them meet at different times, places, days, with rotating players. <br/><br/>If I'm organizing I handle recruitment and setup via mass email, then reminders via email or mass text depending on the group.

In the Wednesday game, we cancel if 2 can't make it.  In my Sunday game, we play even if it's just two people.  They're different groups, and have different preferences in terms of gaming group sizes.  <br/><br/>I'm in charge of organizing both games, but the hosting goes to other players, and I coordinate with them in terms of who's place we're playing at via email messages.  That's usually stabilized to one person's place, but sometimes that changes, and we send a flurry of emails if it does.  <br/><br/>In my monthly games, (with a third group) usually the next six months or so are marked out so that people know when a game is.  We're a busy bunch, so the Monthly games tend to get bumped via emails and so forth, and those games tend to be the most fragile, and prone to cancellations.  <br/><br/>I've used forums in the past, and even a Facebook Page, but I find email works the best.  I find it easier if the email comes to them, rather then them having to seek out the information at some sort of web location. <br/><br/>We don't use phones at all, unless someone's smart phone is accessing an email.  Many of my players either don't have a cellphone or don't get back to their voice mail that often.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292906/#Comment_292906" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-10T14:25:19+00:00" title="September 10, 2010  2:25PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hans: It's not casualness, it's mitigation.

Additionally, there are other nice features like "pages" which are sort of like shared googledocs (good for online character sheets, etc.) and file hosting (you could post pictures or a .pdf of the rules for your players to read).  They are also nice because you can google search the whole group and all of its discussions to find information quickly.  In short, it allows you to tie your game's information into a nice little package and still have messages land in your email inbox.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AnttiKi" title="AnttiKi"><img alt="AnttiKi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.veljeskunta.info/anttiki/antti4_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnttiKi">AnttiKi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294496/#Comment_294496" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-24T04:31:03+00:00" title="September 24, 2010  4:31AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2010 4:33AM by AnttiKi.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Doodle is pretty good: <a href="http://www.doodle.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.doodle.com/</a></blockquote>\nI'll second that.

If we have any planned changes, we mention them at the game the week before. I then text people the day of as a reminder. Attendance could be better but that's more due to flaky people than forgetting game days. This group has 6 members, although realistically, the usual attendance is never more than 3-5 (counting me, the GM).<br/><br/>I'm in another group with a fixed time and day, and when it gets cancelled (fairly often) we're notified, usually via facebook message. This group is composed of 4 members, and usually all or one less show up.<br/><br/>I have a monthly or so vampire game organized by comparing schedules and setting a day/time usually about a month in advance, also over facebook message. This group has 6 members, and who comes varies a lot since people in this group have very busy schedules. Usually games are about 4 people.<br/><br/>Finally I'm in a long running D&amp;D campaign that meets supposedly monthly but practically about every two months, coordinated via email. This group has technically I think 7 members, and has been running for a little over 2 years now. Nowadays, we usually get about 5 people to show up. <br/><br/>In all my games, I find there's a core group at nearly every game and then about the same number of people who show up every once in a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/otherdoc" title="otherdoc"><img alt="otherdoc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://otherdoc.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/jimsquared32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/otherdoc">otherdoc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350460/#Comment_350460" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-04T16:19:22+00:00" title="December  4, 2011  4:19PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's see... I've got rather a lot of games going on because I'm an addict...<br/><br/><b>Weekly D&amp;D-ish:</b> We play this every Friday. We're usually alternating between D&amp;D 4E and Pathfinder, but sometimes I run Deadlands or other games for them (thus far I've also introduced them to In a Wicked Age, InSpectres and Don't Rest Your Head). One of the members is a web-tech-creature and has established a forum for us on his server. Each month we work out what's going to go on the schedule and make changes or cancellations all on the forums. Very occasionally the night of the game a couple of us text the people who aren't on the forum as often to make certain they're coming. The forum itself works better some months than others - most of the members have spouses and children and whatnot, so holidays and vacations can make things crazy.<br/><br/><b>Weekly WoD LARPs:</b> We have rotating games on particular weekends of the month (1st and 3rd, 2nd and 4th, etc), on Saturdays. Usually there are two games held that day: one game in the afternoon and one game in the evening. Not everyone plays every venue (currently we've got Vampire: the Requiem, Vampire: the Masquerade, Mage: the Awakening, Geist: the Sin-Eaters and Werewolf: the Forsaken games going). We play in a set of rooms in a nearby college that we've scheduled to have every Saturday through the college's gaming club, which we're all members of. We're also all part of a global LARPing organization, so we have a ridiculous number of e-mail lists on a national and local level. The local lists sometimes post reminders, but most of the time people find out the gaming schedule by word of mouth. This works because there are something like 30-40 people involved.<br/><br/><b>Semi-Weekly D&amp;D 4E:</b> We play every other Wednesday, typically like clockwork. The DM usually e-mails each of us the night before or day of to remind us. Any problems we may have we let him know via e-mail (or sometimes in person if we happen to see him) and he announces any changes via e-mail. He's very good about it.<br/><br/><b>Semi-Weekly Savage Worlds (Mythic Rome Setting):</b> This is a game I run every other Sunday. I have a Yahoogroup to which I've added my players and I use it to send out reminders a couple of days beforehand. Then sometimes if there are delays the players usually text me or e-mail me the day of.<br/><br/><b>Semi-Weekly Indie-ish Games:</b> I run various different games at my place on alternate Thursday nights. The purpose of the group is to introduce my friends to new and different games - thus far I've run Fiasco, InSpectres and In a Wicked Age, with a <b>long</b> list of other games still to go. I've put together a Facebook group that includes a bunch of the people from the above groups and other friends in my area who I know are also interested in RPGs. For the regular alternate Thursdays I create Facebook Events to which I invite all the group members - I usually do it on the Friday beforehand (any earlier and I'd be worried that people would get confused about which Thursday it's on). Then every now and then if I want to do a random game on a different night in between I send out a message inquiring if there's interest - if I get a response I create a separate Event for that game. The number of people who RSVP usually tells me absolutely nothing about who is and is not coming. Sometimes people will post messages on the Event to give me a better idea, though. Most nights I get 3-5 people over. One night no one turned up. One night I had nine people (it was InSpectres night, so it actually kind of worked). Very chaotic but it seems to be working out all right so far.<br/><br/>So, er... damn. I play a lot of games. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350461/#Comment_350461" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-04T16:42:13+00:00" title="December  4, 2011  4:42PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We have about 10 people in our weekly gaming group but they hardly ever all turn up at once.

We tend to post announcements about planned games and people chime in about their availability. There are people who belong to the group who don't play in every game, so if I announce a D&amp;D game some of them are going to bow out, while others are there for any game, regardless of whether its roleplaying or a game of Ticket to Ride.<br/><br/>There also is a fair amount of emailing and phone calling as we get closer to the date, and there is always one or two people who wait until the Friday evening before Saturday gaming to say whether they will be there or not. I have a core group of players I can usually rely on, and then about a half dozen "sometimes" players. <br/><br/>We also have a Google calendar a few of us use for any kind of social meetup, but this is mostly because we all live in different towns within about 2 hours of each other. A couple people upload their weekend schedules every month like clockwork.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351462/#Comment_351462" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T11:19:59+00:00" title="December 14, 2011 11:19AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been playing an approximately every other Wednesday game for just over a year now.<br/><br/>We try to confirm the next meeting as we wrap up for the night, but sometimes we don't know for sure.<br/><br/>So we throw some emails around on Monday and Tuesday.<br/><br/>I would have set up a group site with Google or Facebook, but my wife doesn't participate in such things, so email worked better for the communicating part.
