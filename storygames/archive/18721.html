I really like endgames: first of all, they are a useful thing to mention in your pitch to potential players as it clear the game has a definite end (something which, in my circles at least, is regarded as a definite plus). But I also like the way endgames can be opportunities to escalate the situation and pick up old plot threads which had been forgotten about.<br/><br/>I wonder if anyone has thought about how an endgame for The Undying might work? For my own part, I was thinking of cribbing from the Kingdom and having people decide at the start of each Time Passes move whether or not this will be the last "period" to play. Apart from that, it wouldn't have any mechanical effect, but knowing that at the start should focus people's attention.<br/><br/>The other thing I was surprised the rules lacked was any mention of flashbacks. In modern vampire media, flashbacks are commonplace. VtM encourages them but, being a crunchy system, doesn't exactly make it easy for you to handle extensive ones. By contrast, with no character advancement rules, The Undying should be ideal for such a device.<br/><br/>I would suggest two moves to replicate that. The first would be a player flashback move, which would be to narrate/play a brief vignette at a period of their choosing, which directly reflects on what is going on in the current scene. It might even be possible to retroactively narrate a debt into the game (although that works both ways).<br/><br/>The other would be a GM move, essentially the same as Time Passes, in which you move backwards rather than forwards. I'm not sure it would need any more mechanics than that, except of course that more recent debts wouldn't count if they were agreed after the flashback. I suppose that if it was set a long time before, you could essentially set it up like a completely new game, with a (semi) new relationship map, etc.<br/><br/>What do people think? Am I on the right lines, or am I missing some obvious points?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle" title="Paul_Riddle"><img alt="Paul_Riddle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle">Paul_Riddle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420145/#Comment_420145" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T17:27:32+00:00" title="August 15, 2013  5:27PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            End game - In AW, moves have fictional triggers and fictional consequences. The proposed end game move starts with a conversation at the table and ends with another couple hours of play. That's totally a thing a gaming group can do; but, it's not a move. Fight, on the other hand, is a move you can use to end the game. Build up to the fight with flaring rivalries and start the fight when the characters escalate to violence.<br/><br/>Flashback  - That's an interesting thought. I'll think that over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420150/#Comment_420150" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T18:00:54+00:00" title="August 15, 2013  6:00PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: Endgame. I disagree up to a point. I certainly agree that it should be up to the group itself to decide when to end play, but I also think that endgame mechanics serve a useful purpose.<br/><br/>I found the end of season mechanic in Monsterhearts really useful, not just because it was useful to mention in my initial pitch, but because it signals to both the players and MC that it is time to turn it up a notch; in my experience that leads to a degree of heightened drama that you wouldn't get otherwise due to people's inclination to hold back (which ideally they wouldn't, but let's face it they do).<br/><br/>That's why I was thinking of a Kingdom-style discussion after every time moves forward move to decide whether to draw things to a close (or at least a break/season finale) at the end of that period. It wouldn't have any mechanical effect; it would just be a green light for everyone to break out the big guns.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle" title="Paul_Riddle"><img alt="Paul_Riddle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle">Paul_Riddle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420151/#Comment_420151" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T18:27:06+00:00" title="August 15, 2013  6:27PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a fine way to frame the scope of a game.

People have communicated to me a desire to play in a variety of different eras, but I'm not sure I want to do them all in historical order; I figured we'd start in the modern day (or close to it) for a few sessions, then, say, jump for an entire session back to ancient Egypt (or whatever) for one session. The tricky thing about this, of course, is that (a) you have to mandate that nobody be allowed to die from the fight move, and (b) the passage of time move isn't really designed with backward progression in mind. (Why should your blood total from today be relevant to your blood total from hundreds of years ago? And do you have to keep track of what you have now so you can come back in at the same point? And so on.) Still, it seems like a natural thing to think about in a setting with immortal characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420171/#Comment_420171" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T20:54:38+00:00" title="August 15, 2013  8:54PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could you take the IaWA approach, and have the players create their characters in different times/periods separately?<br/><br/>In other words, the 500 AD vampire has a completely separate character sheet (and maybe completely different stats/moves) from the same vampire in the modern day, with changes applying to each separately.<br/><br/>(The only thing I could see carrying forward is experience and/or Debt, if it makes sense fictionally.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle" title="Paul_Riddle"><img alt="Paul_Riddle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle">Paul_Riddle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420177/#Comment_420177" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T21:46:09+00:00" title="August 15, 2013  9:46PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's pretty high-concept, and why there is currently no such move.
