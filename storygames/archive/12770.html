I tried... stress tried... GMing Shadowrun 2E for 13 people with a small crowd watching including a girl I had a crush on. <br/><br/>I "thought" I knew the rules. After realizing I didn't, it turned into more of an improv LARP. I realized next time I needed to do a little more homework and start with a smaller group. Maybe less people watching!<br/><br/>I'm pretty amazed how patient everyone was with me. I remember feeling a little embarrassed but determined. After my first attempt I tried again a few months later with Star Wars. It took 3 years before I really got the basics down. And a few years more before I felt I nailed it. But it was worth it! I'm glad I didn't give up after my first time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287174/#Comment_287174" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T09:16:06+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  9:16AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2010 9:51AM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was eleven.

D&amp;D 2nd Edition, I believe: there was still THAC0 and it was still owned by TSR. The guys in my group had already forbidden me from playing female characters (this is a story I tell a lot and I think most of SG has heard it by now), and I was tired of playing dwarven warriors. I think the guys thought I was nuts when I said I wanted to run our next campaign\u2014 in hindsight, I WAS totally nuts. I didn't own any of the books. I had character sheets I made in DOS and printed out on my dot matrix printer, based off of the character sheet my friend Tom let me borrow from the real book.<br/><br/>I don't think we ever played a game that was in one of the canon settings: I don't even remember knowing such things existed. I threw together a fantasy faux-celtic world where three brothers were fighting over the throne: a wizard, a fighter, and a bard who didn't want to get involved initially. I remember they had a paladin sister that the guys kept trying to bang, until I rolled a natural 20 when she was about to kick one of them in the crotch. The boys hooted and hollered and never bothered my female NPCs again. I remember creating all of this setting and all of these decision points that seem so railroady, looking back on it in indie game terms, but somehow the unthinkable happened and one of the PCs (not the one from the crotch-kicking incident) was crowned king and married the paladin. The general consensus among the boys was that I was a great GM, but still didn't know how to <i>play</i> right.<br/><br/>I had a blast with that particular game (it was 2-3 hours 2-3 times a week for over a year), but weirdly enough, I don't like GMing any more.

I just played whilst my various friends took their turns at GMing.<br/><br/>I finally got around to it with a homebrew D&amp;D 4E campaign, at the age of 24, which I GM'd for a group of friends of a friend. The basic concept was stolen from Earthdawn (rebuilding societies after a hundred years of living underground, due to terrible cosmological/planar event), but set in a typical D&amp;D-style fantasy world. This allowed me to make up a lot of stuff as I went along, rather than having to write out histories or provide maps of the land. It met with limited success, with some great sessions, some not-so-great. Near the end, sessions were being cancelled too often due to someone or other not being able to make it. We made it to the second-last session of the story arc, before I gave up on trying to organize the next session. Tis a shame, too.

When I was about 11, an older friend (in his late 20's) introduced me briefly to something vaguely D&amp;D-like (basically, he sat me down, with no preamble, described a situation, and said "what do you do?"). I liked the idea--something in me saw the endless potential of such an activity--and asked him about it. He told me about a game called D&amp;D and gave me a book and some of his notes.<br/><br/>I immediately went to my group of friends and said, "Want to try this game someone told me about?" I ran the first session for them, but insisted that thereafter we take turns GMing (although in practice I ended up GMing more than 50% of the time). It was odd: we had a continuous "campaign" but with rotating GMs. Of course, pretty much everyone took advantage of their "turn" to give their own PC powerful magical items, which was questionable at best. We had to retire the campaign pretty soon because the inflation of powerful items got out of control extremely quickly.<br/><br/>I recall that the first adventure consisted of nothing but a carefully sketched dungeon, some imaginative monsters (I remember a giant mechanical brass spider, and a monster that looked like a pretty girl sleeping facedown, but when disturbed would jump up and attack), and my notes listed a "to-hit" number for the monsters--apparently I didn't understand the concept of Armor Class at the time, or at least wasn't interested in applying it to monsters.<br/><br/>The worst thing about the game was that my best friend really wanted to play a Wizard. Or he did right up until we actually started the game. Then he decided he'd rather play a Ranger. But I was so excited to give him some cool artifact for his Wizard that I <i>didn't let him</i> play a Ranger. I cringe, thinking about that, to this day.<br/><br/>Anyway, the upshot of it all is that I GMed a lot more often than I played for the first ten years or so of my gaming life.

I was eleven.  It was the first game of D&amp;D I'd ever participated in -- I DMed before I ever played a character.  It was a one-on-one game, and we decided I was DMing a few minutes before gametime.  I think I made up the dungeon as I went along.<br/><br/>I remember the ending very vividly.  Because I was a nut for ancient Egypt at the time, the dungeon exit looked like <a href="http://www.theboyking.com/Pic_Files/tomb1.jpg" rel="nofollow">Tutankhamun's tomb</a>, an uncovered 10x10x10 room cut down into the rock, with a stairwell emerging up into it, from the depths. <br/><br/>The PC had one hit point left when he came up out of the tomb, and he was surprised by the goblin sniper lurking above him.  But the goblin rolled two misses!  The player, desperate, and out of ammunition, threw his sword at the goblin.  The die came up 20!

I'm pretty sure it was 1975 because I think Greyhawk (the supplement, not the setting) had come out.  I would have been 16 or 17.  Mark Swanson had created a world map for all the MITSGS D&amp;D games to locate themselves.  I asked for and got a large island and small islands near the edge of a mostly unoccupied continent, and immediately dubbed the area "The Gothic Islands" (I was thinking of both Gothic literature and the historical Goths).  I drew up my own map with a bunch of good guy nations (The Grey Empire, The Seven Cities, the Northern Kingdom, the Republic of Freeport, Seaward Out) and a bad guy nation (The Necromatic Empire (why be subtle?)).  I decided the PCs would be based out of the Republic of Freeport (which was ruled by complicated mess of a local power named He-Who-Rules-But-Does-Not-Govern, A Civil Council and a Military Council).  Underneath the city of Freeport (I stole the name years before Green Ronin stole it!) there were unmappable catacombs (they were like 4- or 5-D) left by the Si'aric (an extinct, time-travelling race (or as extinct as any race of time travellers ever go).  And I built my first dungeon, the 9 towers (the remains of a mage guild that had once occupied a small valley, but the magical equivalent of nukes had reduced it to a sea of green glass with the stubs of several towers sticking up and extensive underground tunnels patrolled by blue-glowing empty suits of armor and various monsters).  And I started running with players who had been unable that day to get a slot in one of the better known MITSGS games like Gorree or Hellsgate or Edwyr.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289172/#Comment_289172" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T10:23:41+00:00" title="August 27, 2010 10:23AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2010 10:24AM by JuddG.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Red Box D&amp;D - I was 12 (so that was...ahem 26 years ago).

You'll do better next week, and indeed every week for the next year!<br/> AND SO IT WAS<br/>ME: I signed up for what?<br/><br/>----<br/>I notice that there is a lot of "I GM'd because that way we played the thing I was passionate about." Me too!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289257/#Comment_289257" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T15:56:37+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  3:56PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mh... first time i GMed... i tried putting up one session of Vampire:Dark Ages, elaborating on a plot taken from a cool vampire comics i read. it was terrible. I thought the homework i'd done was enough, but i found myself totally unprepared (or, better, unprepped) for what the players asked... and i didn't know the system that much. didn't go on... same for a D&amp;D module: it was a 11th level module, and my players knew the game much better than me, so they were bitching around with uber-powered PCs that i had some trouble controlling, and how the tactics i had used for the monsters sucked. Also, they knew  the module by heart, and were that kind of players that think that any level of metagame, even the most extreme, is legitimate. But in the end, it probably was my fault, i should have known the module better. <br/><br/>some 5 years fast-forward (some 6 months ago)... <br/><br/>ME: "hey guys, i discovered these new gaming scenes, mostly from the US. They're so much cooler than D&amp;D, and i want to try them!!! there's one called Psi-Run which is very cool, and is also perfect for One-Shots!!!"<br/><br/>This time, things went well, also (quite) on managing player interactions...<br/><br/>NOW: <br/>Me: "so guys, let's play something"<br/>Friends: "yeah, but you master. we wanna play Vampire"<br/>Me "but... but..."<br/><br/>So,  actuallly, my first serious attempt at mastering... is gonna be sometime soon!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short" title="Lee_Short"><img alt="Lee_Short" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short">Lee_Short</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289273/#Comment_289273" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T17:55:48+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  5:55PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was the summer between 8th and 9th grades, and me and my brother had read some newspaper article about this crazy new game called Dungeons and Dragons.  We didn't have the books, and couldn't (yet) convince our parents to buy it for us.  So we glommed on to the few scattered details mentioned in the article, and started playing.  It was a gas.  I don't remember anything at all of what we did, except that our very first adventure involved trolls and vampires.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
