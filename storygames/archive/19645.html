I'm Running a MonsterHearts game set in a British Manor house in the 1920s.  It's been really fun so far.  One of the Players is playing a serpentine whose landed noble family has fallen on hard times recently, and whose father is now sort of pushing him into an insane revenge plot against the newly rich and generally doing all the sort of horribleness that a Serpentine's family should.<br/><br/>The Wyrm (the aforementioned Newly Rich) showed the Serpentine his collection of treasures (Jazz Records) and the Serpentine Fixated on Victoria Spivey's Black Snake Blues.  He got the record from the Wyrm, but his father found it, called it N**r filth unfit to a person of the Serpentine's station, and smashed it.<br/><br/>The player has decided to take "Nest of Humans" as their next advance.  Pretty sure it's going to be a Jazz band.  With an African-American Singer as the highlight NPC within that band, and a potential love interest.  So the question is this:  Should that NPC have a snake motif?  Because on the one hand, the presence of such a motif calls out the NPC, and the band as a whole, as the escape route/new family for the Serpentine.  On the other hand, the absence highlights the difference between his potentially new family and his old one.  After all, the advance is "nest of humans", not "nest of snakes"<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436323/#Comment_436323" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-03T11:58:30+00:00" title="August  3, 2014 11:58AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like a fun game. I've never quite grokked the Serpentine myself, and this helps me understand it better.<br/><br/>I'd go with the contrast, myself, make it as stark as possible. But it would work well either way: both contrast and similarity can be used to create conflict with the Family, after all (which I would definitely highlight, to create problems for the PC).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436426/#Comment_436426" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-04T22:58:38+00:00" title="August  4, 2014 10:58PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To grok the Serpentine, think the Malfoys in Harry Potter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
