My aunt had made the cake... it's funny how I remember holding it, getting the frosting all over her hands. She was in such a rush to get it inside she didn't stop to think about it - or smile when grandpa took the picture. I wasn't sure if I should call out, or go outside - I wasn't sure if he would hear. I only stood and watched, grim... waiting for her to come in and see what had happened.<br/><br/>I opened the door to let her and grandpa in, shaken and silent. She could tell something was wrong - 'Cheer up, birthday boy! What's got you so grumpy?' - but she hurried off to the kitchen to put the cake in the fridge. Then, just as grandpa came in the door, the second gunshot rang out. It was so hard not to cry, but I had to be a man in front of my grandfather.<br/><br/>My aunt and grandpa rushed to the source of the noise - my parents' bedroom. Dad didn't know I saw him - maybe if he did, he'd still be alive. Or maybe I wouldn't. I just watched in silence as grandpa swore and my aunt rushed over to my father - her brother - to craddle his head in her arms. It was almost surreal; the frosting on her hands all over his face as he gasped out an apology.<br/><br/>We still don't know what drove him to kill my mother, and then himself. I went to live with an uncle; my aunt wanted to take me in, but she reminded me of that day too much. I wonder sometimes what might have happened if someone had gotten there sooner, or if I had acted instead of cowering at the door waiting and worrying.<br/><br/>We'll never know."<br/><br/>=====================================================================================================================<br/><br/>Wait, were we supposed to make up a story, or do you actually want to know what's up with this picture?<br/>It inspired me to write this - I don't know why.<br/><br/>Also, I'm bad at telling people's ages. And genders. I'm assuming the person in the foreground is a female somewhere between her 20's and middle-aged. And I'm assuming the person in the door is a male of 14 years.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213580/#Comment_213580" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-20T07:18:02+00:00" title="June 20, 2009  7:18AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not a real cake and I'm not a real girl. <br/><br/>It's going to be a big day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi" title="Kobayashi"><img alt="Kobayashi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zadkin.free.fr/logoBaveuse2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi">Kobayashi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213583/#Comment_213583" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-20T07:45:18+00:00" title="June 20, 2009  7:45AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Yeah we cloned your dead sister, happy birthday"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Her first kiss. Her first love. The first time she held a classmate under water, coolly assessing the bubbles and the frantic arms, waiting for the bitch to just give in and die.<br/><br/>Well, I forget the first and I've never experienced the second. So I spend a lot of time thinking about Jane. Jane's never experienced the first or the third, and so she spends a lot of time thinking about me. I know, because over the past five months I've learned to speak fluent ghost, and most of her sentences contain my name.<br/><br/>She watches me constantly. I'm in the shower and the curtains tremble for a second. <i>She's probably slid in right next to me, the shameless twit</i>. I'm waking up, and the breeze through my window suddenly gets warm and sweet. <i>She's trying to impress me again. The psycho watches me sleep.</i> Everywhere I go, there's people who look lonely. There's people who look abandoned; depressed. I was supposed to have that. <i>That was supposed to be me, and she took that away.</i><br/><br/>I spent last Thursday in the library. There's not a speck of practical information in the Britannica under 'exorcism'. 'Modern Spiritualism' doesn't have a single entry on ghosts or possession. In short, normal people don't seem to have to deal with this. When I got home that night - tired and frustrated, my father asked me what I wanted on my birthday cake. "I don't care. Something morbid." The best they could come up with was a cute civil war diorama.<br/><br/>And now I'm being told to say cheese. I've got the cake in my hands (being sure to stick my fingers right into that vomitous white icing), and I'm supposed to be smiling. Well, you know what? I'm not going to smile. Not for them, not for Jane, not for my batty grandmother they want to send the picture to. Instead, I'm going to march inside, cut myself a slice of cake, eat a single bite, complain about the texture, and then plunge that goddam cake knife into my own bloody neck.<br/><br/>And when I get to the other side, I'm not going to let Jane anywhere near me. Just to spite her.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi" title="Kobayashi"><img alt="Kobayashi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zadkin.free.fr/logoBaveuse2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi">Kobayashi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213634/#Comment_213634" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-20T13:41:01+00:00" title="June 20, 2009  1:41PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, if I'm doing "rihgt" :<br/><br/>"I started dressing like a girl for my fourteenth birthday, my sister didn't spoke to me ever since"<br/><br/>"their parents' bodies were found in the attic, notice the blood stains on the door ?

The father turned back toward the house as Gertrude winced at his words.<br/><br/>She did not look surprised when a short time later the father came out alone.  She said nothing, and held out the cake for him to take.  The father looked at the house and asked, "Are you sure you won't come inside?  You should give it to him yourself."  Gertrude's arms were tired from holding the cake out.  "Please sir," she said, "it will rain soon and I have to go back home."<br/><br/>Gertrude would not even face the house anymore, and so as she left she did not see Adlore standing silently in the doorway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213648/#Comment_213648" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-20T16:45:29+00:00" title="June 20, 2009  4:45PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2009 1:19PM by Nathan_H.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What is wrong with him?<br/>It's not even his birthday.<br/>He's not been right since mom died.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213655/#Comment_213655" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-20T18:24:10+00:00" title="June 20, 2009  6:24PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe, very cool.
