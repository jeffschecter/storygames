I don't know if they have any issues with consistency but I'm not aware of it being massively popular.  If there are only a small number of people working on something, surely inconsistency is much less likely?<br/><br/>I think what he's talking about is a whole pot of tiny, pre-written snippets.  Like a description of an order of warrior poets dedicated to a certain cause.  Stuff which is decently written, interesting and can be dropped into a variety of settings without requiring someone to write it up from scratch.  Just take it, adjust to fit the specific setting you're talking about and hand it to each of the players.  A big online receptacle for that sort of thing would be great, but I'm so not the person to create that...<br/><br/>EDIT: Actually, there was a sci-fi open source setting I read about a couple of year about where a society had reached singularity and somehow carried on.

Here's what I mean:<br/>\n<br/>\nd20 Monster books are often a hit because you can flip through the pages and read one, then think about adding it to a campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn't just about the art: The ideas are compartmentalized.  Most gamers won't open up a monster book and say "Quaggoths?!  You can't use them in my game, they were made for Forgotten Realms!"  There might be notes relating to other points but there are two things going for it.  The punch comes right away, there's basically no initial investment on the part of the reader (i.e. you don't have to read my two hundred page treatise on humanoid evolution in the underdark), and it's easy to think "Hey, I can use this in my game."<br/>\n<br/>\nTo a lesser extent the same holds for races.  But I think this appeal breaks down with things like countries or knighthoods and so on specifically because they're usually presented as inseparable parts of an interelated web of reams and reams of pages of a setting.  There's often poor division between elements at that level - one idea flows into the next and so on, which is great if you're already a fan but not as good for mining ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where I think the license can play a role.  If you made monster-manual style entries for things like cultures, plots, and so on, knowing specifically that you're creating Open Content, you're saying in the most explicit way possible "Hey, here's something you can plug into your campaign.  There's a few connected ideas here but you can use what you like and ditch the rest."<br/>\n<br/>\nPutting the document up under open terms is a big sign that says "this stuff is remix-friendly" right from the start, and that's significantly different even from an established setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Their sales model is already set. <br>\n<br>\nI think Malcolm's idea of opening up Greyhawk is an intersting one. I agree with him that for the vast majority of settings, opening them up is sorta pointless. There are so many settings with so much info, that who needs another one? When making one of your own is... well fun, actually. To say nothing of easy. <br>\n<br>\nOpening up Greyhawk or such wouldn't be so much about the quality of Greyhawk (which is not high), but about having everything integrate into a single world to make that world very rich.

Like, opening up your setting means that most likely (in reality, "Never") someone is waiting to jump on my Elven Europe with the Serial Number scratched off and STEALZ IT and sell it for MONIES. Because then I won't have ANY MONIES from my awesome setting, and the person who nabbed it will be making ALL THE MY MONIES.<br/><br/>That's the sort of thing that I feel, at least when I smell the development areas at places like RPGNet, EnWorld etc.<br/><br/>EDIT: Another thought: I think I recall back in the "d20 on the horizon" days that folks were entertaining the idea of releasing their own mini-novels or material based on stuff like Drizzt, Elminster, Dragonlance canon, etc.  And then it became clear that all that juicy setting info (and many monsters and the like) was going to get locked down and excluded from CC. Sure enough, that happened.  I think this is just the reinforcing of that early precedent started by WOTC themselves: <br/><br/>Rules? Sure, take 'em.

Basically because I want to encourage people to release other settings for the system for sale, but don't really expect anyone to want to do supplemental material for the setting. I see the setting as the "supplement" part itself already. Why would you supplement a supplement?<br/><br/>The other aspect is, in a backwards kind of way, that keeping the license for the setting material noncommercial actually makes it <i>more</i> open. What I mean is, the setting material defines the tropical and subtropical regions of a supercontinent in some detail, but leaves most of the rest of the very large landmass deliberately vague, so that if your group wants to go off to the north or south and define whatever the hell they like as being there, they can. I assume that other people will come up with cool ideas that I'd never think of in a million years. But if they publish those ideas commercially, they become quasi-official and people may no longer feel as free to make up their own stuff, which might be equally cool or cooler.<br/><br/>Am I making any sense at all?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102311/#Comment_102311" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T13:31:51+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  1:31PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2007 1:34PM by DannyK.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, I think your idea makes a lot of sense.  I wonder if one of the things holding this sort of project back is mutual fear.  The setting's creator may be nervous about explicitly letting other folks play in his sandbox, either because their work will be lousy and detract from the setting's interest, or might even be better and therefore draw attention away from the originator's work.  Conversely, another author might be unwilling to attach his ideas to "someone else's" setting.  Fans do this all the time, but  then they're fans.  <br/><br/>For the consumer, there's the question of canon.  That's never meant much to me, but for a lot of people who buy setting books, this is a big deal.  With an Open Source setting, by definition you don't have any sort of line editor to keep things consistent and avoid contradictions, and it's hard to avoid them without it.  The Glorantha experience is instructive here: the setting can be pretty confusing to get your head around, even with a single authority who can rule things in and out of bounds by fiat.<br/><br/>EDIT: I totally get what you mean about depriving a setting of coolness by mapping it too closely.  In my opinion, that's what White Wolf has done to the Exalted setting, by clogging up the setting to the point that it's just not fun for me any more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102322/#Comment_102322" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T14:45:23+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  2:45PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2007 2:49PM by Ry.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Ryan, what is it you think people would be doing with this open content if it existed?</blockquote>\n(I responded to the other part separately because it was a separate idea)<br/><br/>Ever had the experience of being inspired by something, getting a campaign idea, and then decided to make the project "yours" / "original" / "suitable for public consumption"?  I've had that experience when coming up with campaigns and working on short fiction many times.  I go "wow, it would be cool if there was an alternate universe where THESE guys were actually working for THOSE guys!" and then immediately "Well, it would be cool but I could never get the rights.  Heck, I couldn't even share it online without the danger of a Palladium-like cease-and-desist notice.  Ah well, maybe I can make up something with the same themes..."   You end up blotting out the thing that inspired the whole project in the first place.<br/><br/>Essentially, there's no straightforward answer to your question - because so much depends on what goes into the pool and how it's presented.  If I take my 9000 page campaign setting from 1982 with details from the celestial alignment of constellations over millenia to the consistency of manticore droppings, I am adding <i>nothing</i>.  No one wants to wade through that crap.  But modular ideas, worked together in a digestible format?  That's what would be fertile ground, IMO.<br/><br/>Speaking for myself, if there was a bunch of open content out there I'd be trying to make it into the digestible format if I saw it.  But what would people do with open content in a digestible format?  That's what opens the door.  Write a short story?  Design a campaign and then make it into a product?  Have another community project that builds on the first?  Make a boardgame off the same themes?  Convince a few dozen writers to put in 500 words each to get in on the cool community thing?

You basically have two streams:<br/><br/>1) A noncommercial user doesn't need a license to put their stuff up for an established setting. If I put up Oshawa by Night for Vampire on a web page or on PDF, the most I have to do is backlink to WW's site. If I write up a fictional continent and put it up, then anybody who views/downloads it can use it.<br/><br/>2) A commercial user has no interest in using derivative material from a setting unless it would attract people. Greyhawk Rulez, OGL Continent You Never Heard of Droolz. Something like Dawning Star might be interesting but at most, I'd sell to a subset of Dawning Star fans. This is just like the situation with licensed media games, where they don't draw in fans to be gamers, but draw a chunk of gamers who happen to be fans.<br/><br/>(The third, unspoken niche is the hobby publisher, who wants to charge money but doesn't have a rational economic motive. As Ryan knows from meeting me, I don't think much of that sort of thing, but that's a topic for another thread. Let's just say that the hobby could do with more no-strings attached free stuff.)<br/><br/>Now if you're talking single orc clans and strongholds and families such, you *do* see that in OGL material from time to time, but most d20 gaming uses the site adventure model. I don't care about the orc clan's customs and motives in a general sense, but in terms of where they camp in the dungeons, their tactics and gear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102438/#Comment_102438" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T09:00:37+00:00" title="October 11, 2007  9:00AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Malcolm, it sounds like you're talking about an individual publisher / author working in isolation, taking an open setting or product line and developing it (or not) with a new product.  While I see that as the obvious (and currently the only exercised) option with open content, it doesn't take advantage of collaborative effort.  <br/><br/>Instead of a single open source setting that you either extend or don't, I'm thinking about a collection of quality elements that an author can pick and choose from, add to, remix, and so on.

These days pitching the idea at EN World is mostly ignored - people say "talked it out, not happening" and grumble.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102515/#Comment_102515" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T14:11:38+00:00" title="October 11, 2007  2:11PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, man, if you used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_MediaWiki" rel="nofollow">Semantic MediaWiki</a> for it, you could easily have custom searches for, say, all arctic monsters between CR 1 and 3, or all feats available to a wizard with Dex 13 and Int 17.

While I see that as the obvious (and currently the only exercised) option with open content, it doesn't take advantage of collaborative effort.<br/><br/>Instead of a single open source setting that you either extend or don't, I'm thinking about a collection of quality elements that an author can pick and choose from, add to, remix, and so on.  Even to the point of "Man, my game's 95% done but I need a few words to create a good orc culture."  That goes back to JD's point about damn good stuff and what I was saying about form writing.</blockquote>\nWell, as I said, if you're not out to make a buck then you don't need a license. You can remix whatever you want and put it online and experience has shown that only jerks will threaten you for it. You *already* have the power to remix stuff, just like fanfic writers and gamers do with their Naruto vs. House Slytherin against the Galactic Empire.<br/><br/>When it comes to commercial use, it's just not especially worth it. Let's say I have a big culture database. Let's be charitable and say that only 50% of it is not very good (as opposed to Sturgeon's Law). Let's also assume that there are multiple options for each given thing, so I'm not stuck with the one shitty orc clan somebody bothered to put up and in fact have even multiple good options. Let's say that half of these work with what I want to put together and half of *those* can be inserted without significant changes. <br/><br/>So -- charitably -- 12.5% of the orc tribe entries would actually save me time. *If* there were multiple orc entries *if* half of them were any good *if* half of those good entries worked for my project.<br/><br/>(These are charitable numbers. I have made extensive use of other people's OGC and sifting through it is a pain in the ass -- and that's for rules content.)<br/><br/>Ideas? Ideas are cheap. There is not a caste of creative people whose unique ideas we desperately need. Everybody is incredibly creative in their heads. What's needed is implementations that people enjoy -- and that leads to the ratios above, which makes hacking text not particularly practical. It really doesn't have much to do with an evil design culture<br/><br/>I mean really guys. The whole "We'd have open setting material but The MAN is opposing it?" It's not happening. Phil Reed is not every OGL publisher.<br/><br/>If you want something about the OGL design culture to complain about, try Open Content designations that are specifically designed to make legal use difficult. Iron Heroes stands out as a major example of that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102610/#Comment_102610" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T03:20:12+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  3:20AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That situation is still too focused on the individual publisher / author working in isolation.  In a context where the author isn't "wading through the material" himself - but instead is communicating with other authors about upcoming projects in places like this, I think the situation is different.  Basically, I'm saying open content has extra value in a situation where people are collaborating, even informally.  There's a big difference between showing your notes to someone and them saying "Hey, there's a culture like that in Ebberon." and "Hey, there's a culture like that in The Open Lexicon, there's some characters in there that you might want to yoink, and this haunting spirit that would fit with your guys even better."  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's meant to address your point about "The MAN" too.  My point isn't to take on anybody - my point is that there's value in collaborative writing environments that hasn't been explored because the products that could help facilitate that kind of environment in the context of asynchronous internet communication don't exist (yet).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102615/#Comment_102615" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T04:13:42+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  4:13AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great argument for a database, definitely. I'm just not seeing why anybody who isn't planning on selling something needs to worry about licensing. We know from the fanfic community that IP-ownership is in fact no barrier at all to collaboration. And virtually every popular IP has a wiki or wikipedia branch now. I can create my own Halostar: Galactitrek of the Sith with a good hour of copy/paste. If I put it up for free, the chances of getting in trouble for it greatly resemble 0. I can do this with a group pretty easily, too. We just split it all up, people find the material they want and maybe we do some editing. It won't be pretty but I think that at this point any reasonably intelligent person or group can produce a remixed setting with existing resources, a half decent premise and a idea of the kinds of games they want to do. <br/><br/>Now if I take my D&amp;D barony and upload it with an OGL attached, I'm not sure how it improves things for average hobbyists compared to just uploading the barony.<br/><br/>For a team working on a commercial book, I'm having difficulty reconciling it with any project I can see being worth the effort. As I said, ideas are cheap. Everybody is creative. The value of the work is in its quality and the degree to which it is integrated into the overall book. Developing things to this level of elegance is a significant undertaking even with *one* writer who is producing content to order. A group of pieces written to different assumptions would be much more difficult, at least at the level of refinement I'm talking about. You could minimize this by making most of the contributions cliched, but who wants to buy another cliched setting?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102703/#Comment_102703" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T10:11:58+00:00" title="October 12, 2007 10:11AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>I'm just not seeing why anybody who isn't planning on selling something needs to worry about licensing.

Some of these are the "and want to get paid for it, kinda" folks that clog your market - but I find most of the motivation in this group is the fact that they want to share their ideas with others and be respected for doing so.<br/><br/>That makes licensing important in two ways:  <br/><br/>One, since we're talking about a spectrum of creative people, we'd want to choose a licensing scheme that both sides could engage.  What I see as the big problem is the thousand or so GMs that are right now squirreling away ridiculous hours on their campaigns - identifying the good and bad parts is easy, and yet all this work is getting repeated a thousand times over.  You're right that many hobbyists don't value their own time - but I do, and I know I'm not alone.<br/><br/>The other is respect.  Imagine you're being asked to write 500 words (a novel-sized page) for a collective project.  There's a difference between writing 500 words for a Star Trek community project and one which you "own" and just as much as any contributor.  The ability to say "Yes, you could write a novel about things in here if you wanted later" is important to those who think "Maybe one day I'll dip my toe in the industry."  I want to encourage those people to participate in a commons, and frankly there's less respect when building on properties you don't have the rights to - that's the difference between "fandom" and "authorship".<br/><br/>As for the Sci-Fi's Greatest Hits example, the chances of getting in trouble for it are proportional to its popularity.  The more popular it is the more likely a company owning the IP will notice and issue a cease and desist letter.  Yes, that's being a jerk, but we've seen companies do this to other kinds of projects and if you're going to make this kind of time investment that possibility is a definite dampener on your project.<br/><br/>For a group project like you're talking about, a central authority providing cohesion would obviously be important.  This happens in open source projects too - benevolent dictators that take the reins of a project and decide what's in scope and out of scope for the next development phase.  That's an eminently solveable problem.  But I think that the project needs to be framed in the right way from the start:  Licensing is part of that framing process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102773/#Comment_102773" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T14:21:18+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  2:21PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, this sounds like a total boss, project, though I really like the idea of including all the OGL stuff that isn't part of the d20 tree too, like Fudge, Fate, etc.<br/><br/>I think Justin's probably right about people making less of a stink about 3.0-3.5 stuff once 4 is out, but, I mean, I don't mind if some publishers feel a bit miffed, really, if it makes their open material more accessible for other people and if they're not gonna release an SRD for it themselves. I know John Kim was talking about doing this for True20 or Blue Rose at some point, but ended up not doing it for some reason? Maybe John or Chris Pramas (who sometimes cruises here) can let us know what was up with that.<br/><br/>I guess I would also worry about a quality filter, though.

So in a sense this whole thread is preamble, but since the good-natured fencing with Malcolm has naturally drawn me out here's the pitch.<br/><br/>There are reasons*, at this stage, to do a project like this:<br/><br/>Small in scope,<br/>Systemless,<br/>Containing single-page<br/>Interrelated entries<br/>With Distinctive flavor<br/>In a pre-agreed format and context,<br/>Containing Capital "S" Situations<br/>That can be explored in multiple game systems,<br/>Is filtered through a central authority,<br/>With veto power,<br/>Then edited extensively, and finally<br/>Released under the OGL listing it as 100% OGL material, then<br/>Released again at the same moment with a Creative Commons Attribution license,<br/>For free.<br/><br/>I have something that can provide a core for this, and if necessary can provide more than half of the text itself.  From the perspective of a completed project there would be a lot more to talk about.  I'm saying that to intentionally draw a parallel to the difference between discussing Actual Play experiences and blithering on the internet about games that we've never played until we die of radiation poisoning from the discount cathode-ray-tube monitors we use to feed our everpresent addiction to strawman arguments and flamewars, which I'm told is what got this community off its collective ass and into serious design discussions in the first place.<br/><br/>*I'm not bogging this down with the justifications because they're really long and extensive and mostly boring if you don't take issue with that particular point so if you want to challenge some part of this list and are actually interested in the project, my e-mail is hotmail.com's deeply loved account of ryanstoughton and it would be really great if I could deal with interested objectors out of thread in a way that could keep most of this discussion on the same page.  If you take issue with a particular point on this list but don't have any interest in the project I'd still prefer if you e-mailed me so we can talk about the nature of karma and suffering rather than bogging down the discussion into how much and why we disagree about something that you couldn't care less about in the first place.<br/><br/>All kidding aside, thank you very much for reading my post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102792/#Comment_102792" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T15:12:22+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  3:12PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here Lies<br/>JDCorley<br/>197?-20XX\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>"Radiation poisoning from the discount cathode-ray-tube monitors we use to feed our everpresent addiction to strawman arguments and flamewars"</blockquote>\nBANNED IN ARCADIA EGO                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102869/#Comment_102869" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-13T04:29:40+00:00" title="October 13, 2007  4:29AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan,<br/><br/>That sounds a lot like the Spherewalker Sourcebook, which is one of my favorite RPG books ever published.

The setting was something I had already worked up for a commericial adventure, and I had conflicting emotional attachments about making it OGL as well. However I was painfully aware that making it non-ogl when the rest of the book was OGL made no sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo eventually I decided to stop messing about and remove that setting from the book, and put another setting in its place, Fantasy Greece, which is OGL as well. I've set certain boundaries on the amount I write for it, it is meant to be a short evocative example setting after all, and by OGLing I've allowed other start up publishers to use something that will strike a chord with gamers so hopefully the fun will expand from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4509/open-content-brain-damage" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4509/open-content-brain-damage" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4509/open-content-brain-damage/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F4509%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F4509%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
