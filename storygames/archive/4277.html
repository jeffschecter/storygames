If it works the way I want it to it will be more like the first spy game we ever played than anything I have written thus far. But that is neither here nor there except that it got me thinking about plans and the things that can go wrong. This lead me to the idea of playing the bad guys in Die Hard.You have this perfect plan to take over the tower and get the money and get out of there but you didn't count on John McClane.<br/> <br/>As the game istarts, you will come up with an audacious plan divide the plan into steps, each of which will be a scene. Each player will control one or more characters, a bad guy and up to three mooks. The mooks count as hit points sort of, they can die without changing the game and so can be sacrificed early. In the early scenes mooks go out to do thingsn to move along the plan. The player rolls the dice and then divides up the points which must be put toward Completeing the Task, Hurting McClane, and Staying Alive. There should never be enough dice to make all three sure things. When your Mooks die they loose resources which wind up making McClane a stronger opponent. When all of your mooks are dead your lead must go into the scenes in their place. You are stronger than the mooks but still cannot kill Bruce (he cannot die) you can get more done but when you die you have to start running McClane and whatever resources he has acquired become yours to use against the other players.<br/> <br/>This will hopefully bring the game to another level. Initially McClane just acts based on the outcome of your dice, but when a player starts to run McClane he gets their turn to start hunting the hunters for real. As additional players die they get to help. adding dice to McClane's rolls. the winner of the game is the last bad guy. <br/><br/>The important things I have to figure out are: 1. How can I make it fun for the second player to die, 2. How to set up the caper both how to create a plan and how to set the difficulties.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96231/#Comment_96231" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T01:22:01+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  1:22AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe the second player to die gets to handle all the stuff that doesn't directly involve McClane or the terrorists: the news crew outside, the hostages, the cops, the FBI agents, and so on.  It becomes a second tier of problems for the remaining bad guys to deal with -- not only is McClane now actively hunting them, but their perfect plan is beginning to run into all those annoying little snags.  If they don't start devoting attention to blocking McClane from accessing these new resources, the end will come even sooner.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wombleton" title="wombleton"><img alt="wombleton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wombleton">wombleton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96264/#Comment_96264" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T06:42:26+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  6:42AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sidekick?
