There were three of us total and we used a history seed from the back cover: <i>An ancient line of dragon-kings dies out as magic fades from the realm\u2026  </i><br/><br/>Our history ended up being more about the degradation of one particular line of dragon kings, Clan Ito, (we'd put a Japanese-style feudalism and culture into our Palette), and the end of <i>dragons</i> from the world.  Clan Ito did essentially die out mid-history as Seiji "Sparrow", the bastard son of Soma Ito made a Faustian bargain with the Fae princes which ensured the relationship between Ito and any dragon allies would ultimately be corrupted.  All the current generation of the Ito Clan were spirited away to the Dreaming World and became changelings following that arrangement.<br/><br/>We had an repeated theme running through our history of costly arrangements and bargains.  Given that you can go far forward in the history to see the ultimate result of such arrangements or back in time to cast further irony or pathos on the "pending" bargain, I wonder if this is potentially a naturally recurring mode of play.<br/><br/>There was one on-screen "immortal" dragon character, Mala, who appeared across different Periods in our history.  Such a character was against the advice of the text but it seemed to work relatively well and it made sense to us to make an allowance for dragons.  The descriptions of Mala across the history were interesting (and sad towards the end).  As immortal artifacts, Legacies were a part of the game I really enjoyed as well.  I can see how I'd prefer to explore other humans and/or dragons in our history than repeatedly coming back to Mala.<br/><br/>We only started to play towards the strengths of the game as the session concluded.  I could begin to see how having Events and Scenes inserted in the history that cast new light and understanding on already played Events as being really powerful.  I think Microscope is a game that will really benefit from its participants becoming proficient at it through practice.  This interests me in a similar way as it does for certain boardgames with a lot of depth and mastery.<br/><br/>As I suspected, making sure to describe the outcome of an Event, rather than only the beginning of it was really different.  Not going into a general "GM-less-Story-Game-collaborative-mode" during most of the game and specifically when acting on other principal characters was also a stretch.  In a good way.  In this, Microscope reminded me a bit of when In A Wicked Age and a couple other games came along and said, "remember all those Story Games habits, practices and techniques you and your group have been developing for a few years now?  Yeah, well forget all that.  This is different."   e.g. Stakes setting, etc.<br/><br/>We did not have a single Push in the course of our session.  I don't know how much of that was having played together quite a bit.  I'll be curious to see how that varies at the con next weekend.  I think we were all pretty committed with just giving one another a ton of power, saying "Yes, and" and seeing where it went.  It went good and unexpected places.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317430/#Comment_317430" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-22T05:21:47+00:00" title="March 22, 2011  5:21AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great write-up.

The odd/interesting part is that even when you have what feels like a really tight/single-topic history, at any moment, any player can use their turn and break into completely unforeseen territory. It sometimes takes players a while to realize they have that power, and then --bing!-- the light goes on.<br/><br/>I find that lots of games go by with zero Pushes, which is jolly. Others have a bunch. It may just be a reflection of how much those particular people at the table are in the same mindset that particular day. Push is a safety net, not a tool you want to try to use for it's own sake, so yes, you were doing it exactly right. And just like you said, that can throw people who think they're supposed to move the scene towards a mechanical conflict, since that's what you normally do in story games.<br/><br/>(FYI I linked here from the <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/" rel="nofollow">lame mage</a> page, for people who want to see hot AP)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317608/#Comment_317608" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-23T14:42:24+00:00" title="March 23, 2011  2:42PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Matthew--we were really starting to engage the tools just as our four-hour time slot ran out.  That's to be expected with a new game, though.  We've talked about running another session with the same cards after Gamestorm.<br/><br/>Our game actually reminded me of the first time I played Archipelago, years ago in a one-on-one game at a house con.  We ended up just doodling on the map and telling stories for two hours, never engaging the coin-flip resolution mechanic, because it was more interesting to stretch your own ideas to encompass what the other person brought into it.  I think the "Faustian bargain with the Fae" event was Harry's contribution--there had been no hint of any mythology besides dragons up to that point, and it took me back a little.  Once I adjusted and started to work that thread in, though, it became really interesting and ended up being the major force behind the downfall of the kings.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I got as much out of the Scenes as I did out of playing Periods and Events, possibly because (as Matthew conjectures) I had to change gears against my normal SG mode of role-playing.  I liked the question-answering aspect of the scenes a lot, but I felt like in several cases the question was answered as soon as we framed the scene, and the rest was just making up dialogue until we got to the inevitable.  I think I could easily play a whole game of Microscope without even going to Scenes, though.  The worldbuilding aspect of Event/Period, mixed with the Lens and Legacies, is a fun and complete game on its own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317629/#Comment_317629" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-23T18:18:51+00:00" title="March 23, 2011  6:18PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Proficiency regarding the Questions for Scenes and the character's thoughts preceding were the main things I was thinking of that would improve with repeated play.  I was framing/steering harder with my character's thoughts out of habit (Story Games brain damage), and partly because I was in demoing-prepare-for-con-game mode.<br/><br/>I would probably take a more subtle approach in future sessions, hoping to be more often surprised by the answers and by the characters' actions leading up to those answers. <br/><br/>For the first scene, when we asked what Soma Ito had to give up to bond himself to Mala and I chose immediately to create the non-required character of Soturo Ito, honorable brother to Soma, rather than one of the required characters, I was making a strong suggestion that Soturo might be the sacrifice.  I was actually hoping that one of us, me especially, would find a natural path to some unexpected result, but we each made relatively obvious choices going forward.  It was a nice scene, and the Legacy of the Sword of Soturo the Worthy was ultimately born from it, but it was a scene with no real surprises.<br/><br/>That's something that might go a different way with repeated play as players get better at finding alternate paths towards answering the Question of a Scene.<br/><br/>I expect further play will also create some really surprising prelude Scenes and Events that, for example, cast an entirely new light on Soburo's apparently noble sacrifice.  That's where I see some ripe fruit that's not hanging low enough for me to reach the first time out but is definitely up there and which I suspect tastes different from a lot of the other gaming fruit I've enjoyed before.<br/><br/>I have a lot of other thoughts about Microscope but need to stew on them for a while.  And play again!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317812/#Comment_317812" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-25T15:19:03+00:00" title="March 25, 2011  3:19PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2011 3:50PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As players get the hang of their power, it should become clearer that no matter how much you think the answer is obvious and must be X, another player can change things to make it Y.<br/><br/>In fact, it isn't the top priority of Scenes to be surprised by the answer. If the answer is exactly what you expected, that's okay, so long as you learn about the characters and feel the moment along the way. Even if every player was pretty sure the captain was going to go down with the ship (answer: yes!) by playing out the scene why see why he did it, what's he like, what other characters cared and why. All those details inspire our play going forward.<br/><br/>Just like a normal story games scenes, where you're building towards a conflict and dice, the trick is not to rush things. Enjoy yourself, play the characters a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
