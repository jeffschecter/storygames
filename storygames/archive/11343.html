It kinda got me excited to try something like this at home. <br/><br/>To summarize perhaps too briefly, Arnold and his friend(s) run the same story through a series of game systems in a series of con slots. It's a really neat idea, but I think the strongest application of this idea isn't at a con. It seems best-suited to home-based, weekly games. <br/><br/>So, my idea (or my appliclation of Arnold's idea) is to chart the history of a new world, using a different game each week. Maybe start in early history with In a Wicked Age or Solar System. Maybe do something medieval or Renaissance with Burning Wheel or Chronica Fuedalis. Do an Old West type thing with Dogs in the Vineyard or Dust Devils. Maybe zoom into a relationship drama with Under My Skin, then start the sci-fi stuff with shock: to usher in th dystopia and explore it with Misspent Youth. Finally, you can see how the world ends with Apocalypse World, then do a historical miniseries event with Primetime Adventures. <br/><br/>I was figuring I'd pregen characters for most games, and try and run only one or two sessions per game system, and forsee the potential need for running them over two sessions. <br/><br/>How about you?<br/><br/>(Ordinarily, I'd italicize and link these games, but I'm doing this from my iPhone, so, no.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252055/#Comment_252055" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T10:45:33+00:00" title="January 22, 2010 10:45AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is a crazy idea, and I'll be amazed and impressed if you follow through on it.<br/><br/>Another idea: use "Diana: Warrior Princess" in the historical miniseries as an excuse to totally mangle the true history.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252058/#Comment_252058" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T10:56:46+00:00" title="January 22, 2010 10:56AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've thought about doing a serialized set of con games, mainly as a way to (hopefully) get folks to attend Sunday afternoon.

Some of them seem to be very unforgiving and brutal, so maybe a game without a lot of player control, and without much hope for help from dice... (I almost want to suggest low-powered characters from GURPS or something) but then some of them are full of possibility and dream, something really empowered like Lacuna could work.<br/><br/>That is a heavy task you undertake.

Ideally you'd need the same people to commit to three sessions or so (Friday Microscope, probably one Saturday, one Sunday) which might be a hard sell. But it would be a hell of a cool experiment. You'd need to block out a little time at the end of each session to agree what was next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258703/#Comment_258703" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T08:59:50+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  8:59AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Microscope?
