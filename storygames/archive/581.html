<p>What kind of abilities and resources should the GM in Misery Bubblegum be granted?</p>
<p>Here are a few of the sort of things that I see happening to protagonists in teen dramas:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can't figure out what another character is thinking  </li>
<li>They feel keenly the (perhaps imagined) approval/disapproval of another character  </li>
<li>They fail to express themselves  </li>
<li>Circumstances suddenly change in a way that impacts their relationship  </li>
<li>Coincidence conspires against true love  </li>
</ul>
<p>So what kind of goals should the GM be pursuing?  What should they be rewarded for?  What rewards should be given?  Are those all the same thing (i.e. "The GM should be rewarded for pursuing the right goals with more ability to pursue those goals")?</p>

<p>Can I turn your question on its head? Maximally three of those things, and two when I am feeling less generous, are importantly external. The other bits can easily be player abilities, and the three don't seem to have any independent motivation not to be.</p>
<p>That is, a character's perceptions are relevant to that character. His ability to act is also relevant to him. Changing circumstances are potentially a tool for players to manipulate - crucially see the way that <em>Breaking the Ice</em> handles external adversity.</p>
<p>So, <em>what do you need a GM for?</em></p>

                            Thanks for articulating my own question so well, Shreyas.  I wondered this in the "GM advancement" thread too, but figured that wasn't a place to bring it up.                        </div>

                            Here's a random idea:<br/><br/>From what I can recall of teen dramas, the "drama" tends to happen in very specific settings or situations.  For example, "alone with your crush" would be a time when there would be drama!<br/><br/>What if the GM had a deck of cards in the style of <i>Once Upon a Time</i>?  Each card could only be played in a particular situation, and would have an incident of some kind on it.  That incident could be instantiated by the PC or by the GM, but playing the card would mean "This has to happen now."<br/><br/>For example, there could be cards to be played "when alone with your crush."  The consequences could range from "you are discovered doing something embarassing" to "you can't say what you mean" to "your crush has bad news for you."  They wouldn't be specific, so that the players could interpret them to mean whatever they like - a la the Roach, I suppose.<br/><br/>The increased power of the GM would be the ability to have more cards available to them, increasing their options for how to make drama for the players when the players put themselves into teen-drama situations.<br/><br/>I don't know if it would be fun, but it's an idea - and as you can probably tell from <i>Decade</i>, I'm a fan of cards structuring scene framing (or, in this case, scene interventions).  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

<b>They can't figure out what another character is thinking </b><br/>The GM can roll Misunderstanding Dice to give the players red herrings (Jenny thinks you're not athletic enough -- you should try out for football!).  Keying into flags gets a bonus to the roll.<br/><br/><b>They feel keenly the (perhaps imagined) approval/disapproval of another character </b><br/>The GM dispenses Approval points from all NPCs.  Approval points are then spent by players for rerolls (Jenny believes in me!  I can do this!).<br/><br/><b>They fail to express themselves </b><br/>The GM is armed with creme pies, which he throws at the players as they are talking... no wait, that's just silly.  All those creme pies would get expensive.  The GM can use Misunderstanding Dice to garble the reaction of NPCs (although he doesn't change what the players say, just the reaction to it).<br/><br/><b>Circumstances suddenly change in a way that impacts their relationship</b><br/><b>Coincidence conspires against true love</b><br/>These are both pure situation creation and development.  The GM could have a budget of Complications that he can throw into the mix whenever things are working too well, perhaps.<br/><br/>One thing I'm noticing, Tony, is that all of this calls on the GM to <em>get in the way</em> which is slightly different than the "traditional" GM which sets up an evil plot which the players get in they way of ("if it wasn't for those pesky kids!").  That's an interesting dynamic.  How do you make it so that the GM is really facilitating, and not just being an annoying wet blanket?                        </div>

<p>Okay, I wasn't clear:  The things I listed are <em>examples</em> of what the GM might want to do.  If you think they should do something else <em>too</em>, or you would rather phrase/categorize some of the things I've written differently ... great!  I'm looking for ideas ... the examples are just meant to prime the pump.</p>
<p>As a for-instance:  opposition from big-bad style enemies ... in <em>some</em> teen dramas (Sailor Moon, Buffy) it's a big deal.  In <em>some</em> teen dramas (Kare Kano, Kodocha) it is almost non-existent.  In <em>some</em> teen dramas (Veronica Mars, Ranma 1/2) it's sorta halfway between.</p>
<p>I look at that and I think two things in quick succession:  "Oh shit!  How do I design a system that <em>might</em> be about throwing big bads at your teens, but <em>might</em> have no big bads at all," followed by "Wait!  It's obvious!  Those are two different paths of GM advancement ... one type of GM loads up on big-bad type abilities, and one GM puts his advancement in other areas!"</p>
<p>EDIT:  Imagine I were asking you "Okay, what types of skills should characters in a cartoon cthulhu game have?"  You'd say things like "Freak out like a wild-man," and "Read books and shit" and maybe "Magic."  We try to break up the space of things that the player might want their character to do into discrete tasks.  And then we could say things like "Do we need Perception?  Isn't that subsumed under 'Freak outlike a wild-man?' "  In the same way ... what types of skills should a shoujo GM have?  How do we break up the huge space of things that GM might want to do into discrete story-tasks?</p>
