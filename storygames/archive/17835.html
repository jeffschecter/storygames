I'm only a little way in, but I can tell you a few things:  <br/><br/>1) the cover and the Amazon page make this seem like its a book about games and simulations in general, covering a wide stretch of topics and history.  It isn't.  The things mentioned on the cover (chess and computer simulations and stuff) get only mentioned peripherally as far as I can tell. <br/><br/>2) This book is, simply put, 600 pages of meticulously research and detail on the early history of Dungeons and Dragons (and 70 pages of bibliography and index).  Those six hundred pages only cover D&amp;D up until 1980.<br/><br/>3) The author has some idiosyncrasies in his writing.  He occasionally jumps around from topic to topic.  He occasionally comes down in support of one or another controversy that most gamers have forgotten ever happened.  He refuses to use personal recollections as a source, and only ever cites written records from the time.  And he tries to reference every possible available record of the time. <br/><br/><br/>So if you're looking for way more detail than you need on wargaming and D&amp;D in the 1970s, this is a great book.  I love it so far.  For some people, this may be way more information than you ever wanted on such a narrow topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403628/#Comment_403628" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-13T17:44:44+00:00" title="January 13, 2013  5:44PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Worth noting tht the sample section up on Amazon is pretty massive.

I found it a bit odd that he so relentlessly favored written sources when a lot of the founders of the hobby are still around, but not getting any younger.  Yes, people's recollections are biased and unreliable, but they're still valuable and the documents will last a lot longer than the people will (well, except maybe for documents produced on photocopiers).  He also tends to attribute motives to people that may or may not have had (Ken St. Andre is kind of annoyed at some of the motives attributed to him vis-a-vis <i>Tunnels &amp; Trolls</i>, particularly as the guy apparently never made any attempt to contact him).<br/><br/>As for the book itself -- it's a very specialized thing, but if you're interested in that sort of thing, there's nothing else like it available.  I was particularly impressed that he went into detail about Midgard II/Midgard Limited -- that's pretty obscure!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403649/#Comment_403649" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T07:11:56+00:00" title="January 14, 2013  7:11AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I only read the sample on Amazon, and it was pretty thick going.<br/><br/>OTOH, it gave me a lot more insight into the development process that leads to D&amp;D eventually, and gave me a whole lot better idea about the kinds of play that was influencing those developers.<br/><br/>Personally, if found the story of how D&amp;D moves to being a dungeon bashing game at its core ( rather than being a variant of a broader game-- dungeon bashing being a neat side-quest kind of variant of it) fascinating. Weirdly, part of it seems to have hinged on Dave Arneson needing to hitch a ride with someone, there not being much room in the car, and heading off to show Gygax this game he'd been creating and playing where he lived.<br/><br/>The mapping/exploring/fighting in tunnels version was simply easier to fit in the car space available and faster to demo than the broader game. That variant is the one that caches Gygax's attention though, and becomes the one that is developed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/increment" title="increment"><img alt="increment" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/increment">increment</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403672/#Comment_403672" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T12:33:57+00:00" title="January 14, 2013 12:33PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Definitely I wouldn't recommend the book for anyone that isn't really interested in the minutiae of how wargames and role-playing games evolved. It includes a significant amount of history about how chess variants turned into wargames and then how wargame systems advanced up to Chainmail, but the book only gets into that in the middle (Chapter Three). The bits about computers are only dealt with in the last two sections, and they really only detail how the principles of simulation first made the jump from the tabletop into digital form. The treatment of those subjects isn't just peripheral, though, I'd say: the wargaming history section alone is about 100 pages. If the cover billed it as a history of D&amp;D, I suspect a lot of readers would feel misled.<br/><br/>In terms of the choice of method, dealing with only primary sources rather than interviews, it was really just a scope decision. You'll get a very different result if you rely on interviews than if you rely on primary sources, and the two don't reconcile well, to put it mildly. Now that much said, I think attempts to capture the oral history are also valuable, and there are great books out there about that (like Robin Laws' "40 Years of Gen Con"). If you look at the acknowledgments of PatW, you'll see credits to a lot of people interviewed for the book, including Gygax and Arneson and many others. From Peter's circle, for example, George Phillies was a very useful contact. These interviews were helpful as background, but again, the scope decision was not to cite them in the book itself. It's true that Ken St. Andre wasn't one of the people interviewed for the project, but Tunnels &amp; Trolls doesn't occupy a lot of real estate in the book, and to my recollection the book doesn't impute any "motives" to him other than producing a lower-cost and simpler dungeon exploration game. It's true that the book does cite some contemporary negative reviews of T&amp;T, and I can understand that Ken might not be happy to see that; it also provides a couple of contemporary quotes from him that perhaps he wouldn't agree with today. I would argue that including that material, however, was crucial for understanding how the nascent industry was evolving at the time.<br/><br/>Anyway, there are at this point a large number of reviews of the book out there, if you Google for them. If you want a less scholarly, more anecdotal history of D&amp;D, I gather that might be what we'll find in Dave Ewalt's history of D&amp;D, when it comes out this summer. There's plenty of room to approach this story with different methods and goals. The goal of PatW was to nail down the story of how we got from chess to MMOs as a scholarly history of ideas: to capture who wrote what when, and how chains of influence moved through centuries of game design. I'm sure the book isn't perfect, but the feedback I've seen thus far seems to be that it improves on previous scholarship substantially.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403694/#Comment_403694" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T17:49:13+00:00" title="January 14, 2013  5:49PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just wanted to pipe in a write a quick thank you to all the well-rounded reviews.<br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
