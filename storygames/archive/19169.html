This identity should be evocative enough to give your character some idea of what behavior is proper and what results are most desirable, for this is what success means in this game.<br/><br/>How much savoir faire does your character exhibit when filtered through this identity?  19 for a lot, 1 for very little, or anything between.  This should usually (but not always) reflect how much experience and confidence your character has in conceiving of themselves as this identity.<br/><br/>Using the same process, create one or more competing (but true-ish) identities for your character without repeating a savoir faire score.  After all, none of us have figured out exactly who we are.  You can have a total of 20 savoir faire.<br/><br/>In a challenge, roll a d20 for stress.  Under stress, we tend to respond according to ways of being with which we are familiar, no matter how much we might wish to be someone or something else.  If you roll a 14, for instance, you can only successfully respond to the challenge using an identity with a savoir faire of 14 or more.<br/><br/>The key to success: success isn't what the player would count as success, but what the identity would.  For example, let's say you are Blackbeard when he briefly attempted to retire from pirating life and become a wealthy gentlemen.  Pirate 9; gentleman 1.  You are at a gala, someone insults you, and you roll stress of 15.  No matter how much you might like to play the gentleman, if you want to succeed, you'll have to do it in a pirately way, like gutting him without giving him the chance to draw his sword.<br/><br/>Suppose you'd rather fail as a gentleman than succeed as a pirate?  This is fine, but the greater the gap between your stress and the savoir faire of your chosen identity, the more complete and disastrous the failure should be.  If Blackbeard decides to play the gentleman, then he probably not only fumbles his rejoinder but also rips his pantaloons or trips a duchess while attempting an overly flourished bow.<br/><br/>For every challenge, you get a success point or a failure point.  Success points can be used to increase the savoir faire of the identity that you used (up to 19) at the expense of another identity.  Failure points are use-or-lose and can be used to create a new identity with a savoir faire of 1.  This is an opportunity for the character to excuse or, ideally, transcend their failure; as such, this may well become the character's new favored identity.<br/><br/>One final point: Sharply diverging identities give you more options for how to behave, but similar identities whose differences are more nuanced mean choosing success under stress is less likely to produce behavior and results that conflict with your character's preferred identity.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Being that there is nothing new under the sun, especially when proposed by someone novice to design, what games should I look at to see a better developed version of this mechanic?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427673/#Comment_427673" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-26T18:20:34+00:00" title="January 26, 2014  6:20PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2014 6:21PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this!  I wrote something similar a while back using principles rather than identities, but I like a lot of these particulars better.  I don't know of a published game that focuses on this dynamic at its core.  Pendragon's passions redefine the character as they go up and down, the traits in Grey Ranks can turn nicer or nastier as the character matures, motives in Rustbelt give you new traits when you act against them, Cyberpunk, Vampire and Sorcerer all track Humanity loss... but none of those seem all that similar to me.<br/><br/>I'd want to play this in some sort of scenario where my character has an extremely pressing reason to change, so there's something at stake with all the identity-shifting (as opposed to an idle "let's see who I've turned out as when we stop").<br/><br/>One mechanical thought: I love the idea of creating new identities in moments of failure, but those are never going to become favored if you can only successfully use them on 1 of 20 rolls.  Maybe start them at savoir faire 3 or 4 instead of 1?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427683/#Comment_427683" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-27T06:29:34+00:00" title="January 27, 2014  6:29AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like you created a system with ingoing randomness, compared to outgoing randomness that most roleplaying systems use. Outgoing is about doing decisions and then roll for it, while ingoing is rolling and then do the best you can with the result. The boardgame <b>Kingsburg</b> uses ingoing randomness, and <b>Settlers of Catan</b> too. You get random resources and then you decide what to do with them. I think there is a huge advantage with ingoing, compared to outgoing, but it's a different discussion.<br/><br/>I've been looking forward to see roleplaying games with ingoing randomness, because I think it could render situations like the one with your pirate. When I thought of something similar, I had traits that were numbered. When doing something, you rolled 1d6 (or several) and could use the traits with the corresponding number(s). If you had six traits you could give them each a different number, or you could assign the same numbers to several traits which would give you more options when that number would come up.<br/><br/>I haven't done anything with this, other than playing around with the idea in my mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427684/#Comment_427684" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-27T06:35:19+00:00" title="January 27, 2014  6:35AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Being that there is nothing new under the sun, especially when proposed by someone novice to design, what games should I look at to see a better developed version of this mechanic?</blockquote>\nYou're describing the mechanical logic of <i>Hero's Banner</i> here.

I can see a player having a sheet of identities and rolling, seeing what their options are and picking a win or lose to get to their goals. They may fail their way to success if they play it right. Especially if they GM builds the story in a back and forth dialog. This could be great fun and offer lots of flexibility of play.<br/><br/>Mechanically I'd recommend having a set list of identities rather than have players make them up. Making things up as you go along uses up player creative energy inventing the wheel rather than seeing where the car will take you. <br/><br/>I can definitely see this as a published game.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
