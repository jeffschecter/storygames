As Blank Reg says in the pilot, "Remember when we said there was no future?  Well, this is it."<br/><br/>When I ran my cyberpunk games, both <i>Cyberpunk</i> and <i>Shadowrun</i>, I drew from three major sources: the c-punk fiction of William Gibson, <i>Blade Runner</i> and <i>Max Headroom</i>.  There was something quirky and subversive and oftentimes flat-out <i>funny</i> about how <i>Max Headroom</i> handled the tropes of the genre and humor played a large part in what might otherwise have been an entirely grim, even nihilistic view of the media-saturated future.<br/><br/>I'm curious to know how many of you were likewise influenced by <i>Max Headroom</i> in your gameplay or game creation.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284656/#Comment_284656" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T12:01:47+00:00" title="August  6, 2010 12:01PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, it was three-fold:<br/>-The variety of characters available. After <i>Max Headroom</i>, even though most of my friends were still playing hackers/deckers and mercs/street samurai, I suddenly wanted to play characters that used their wits and worked things out through clever thinking, on-the-ground contacts, and luck. It was no longer so much a matter of "I need to hack into this code" or "I need to fight this guy." It became "I need to get someone to hack this code for me while I do this other thing," or "I need to cause a scandal that will make this tough guy distracted long enough."<br/><br/>-The types of possible adventures. My friends and I, up until that point, had Cyberpunk campaigns that were, more or less, D&amp;D with cyberware. Get told to do a job, complete the job, get paid. After <i>Max Headroom</i> there were a lot more adventures where the characters would run across information that would pique their interest, and the tension and danger was caused by them looking into that information. Also there was one adventure that directly involved the parents of one of the characters (though it was so long ago now, I can't remember what exactly the situation was). Before, I don't think we ever seriously thought of the PCs family and friends as anything more than window dressing.<br/><br/>-NPCs and single-shot Characters. The show really opened our eyes as to the possibility of more involved and regularly interacting with NPCs. It also provided us with the opportunity to get some of our friends who couldn't always game involved. If they could only show up for the night, we handed them off a slightly beefed-up NPC that was a regular PC's friend/contact that was coming along for the ride.<br/><br/>Of course, this WAS back in the day when we were still young, and rarely thought more deeply than reward/fighting/getting the girl. But it definitely stuck with us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Not to mention totally crushing on Amanda Pays.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood news about the DVDs.  Philosophically I believe that once an intellectual property has been released to the public that the owners have a duty to keep that property available for ongoing consumption.  If they fail to do so then IMO efforts made by consumers to obtain access to it are not morally wrong.  If I can't get legitimate access to it, then you have no right to bitch about me getting illegitimate access to it.  So now that it is to be legitimately accessible, I'll have to go out and make sure I obtain it legitimately.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt pisses me off that Art of Noise's Paranoimia still isn't available on ITunes  <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEPq0FvFm3g" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEPq0FvFm3g</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI will say that Max aged much better than Matt Frewer himself did...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284716/#Comment_284716" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T18:56:39+00:00" title="August  6, 2010  6:56PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2010 7:09PM by nemomeme.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Max Headroom...  That takes me back.  I honestly don't remember the show all that well other than I liked it and I had it bad for Amanda Pays.  I remember thinking it was a little silly relative to things like Burning Chrome though.  Was there a pirate radio station in Max Headroom?  The longest running character (3+ years) in my cyberpunk campaign was "Yellowman," a Jamaican pirate radio dude and I think I remember him being inspired maybe by someone in Max Headroom.  <br><br>We did quite a few rogue journalism arcs that were probably inspired by Max.  Seems like <i>none</i> of our plots were inspired by D&amp;D.  That was one of the things I really liked about cyberpunk role-playing.  I stole almost all of them from things like Blade Runner, Burning Chrome, Hardwired, When Gravity Fails, &amp; Islands in the Net.<br><br>Did <i>Cyberspace: Sprawlgangs &amp; Megacorps</i> really swipe that "We make everything you need, you need everything we make." motto from Max Headroom?  I thought that was the motto one of their corps that I ended up using as a main antagonist in my game for a long time.  I'm going to have to go back and look at that.<br><br>Matter o' fact I'm going to go steal a bunch of stuff from When Gravity Fails for my current Apocalypse World.  That'll actually work <i>really</i> well.  Yeah...<br/><br/>edit: beyond role-playing influences it just now occurs to me that Max might be at least partly responsible for why I've always fact-checked corporate media and "journalism" (R.I.P.) so critically to the point that I discovered it's almost impossible to get anything approximating reality from mainstream sources inside the U.S.  Max was oddly prescient from this standpoint, with the FCC abolishing the Fairness Doctrine in 1987.  Though I suppose a lot of Max Headroom was a retread of memes unleashed by Network...                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284717/#Comment_284717" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T19:15:34+00:00" title="August  6, 2010  7:15PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yellowman is an albino reggae singer.

I think you need to solve an audience paradigm problem or incorporate it substantially it into your game somehow, and I think you need to look at Polaris too.<br/><br/>I assume this will be set "20 minutes into the future" similarly to Max Headroom and Transmetropolitan.  I say this with not enough recollection of either work (watched/read both of them in "real time" and not since), but even as forward-looking as both of those things are, they seem almost quaint in one important aspect.  While they both touched on this, I think they didn't do enough with "imagine a future where everyone's at the circus and doesn't give a fuck about the truth."  Even for many of those people who know or think they know the hideously immoral reasons behind much of American foreign policy, they shrug, ask "What can I do?" and go watch Hell's Kitchen.   <br/><br/>Modern corporate media doesn't care that there are niche areas where the truth is available.  They just drown them out and shunt them aside.  Other societal forces work to distract populations.  People are simultaneously cynical about every societal entity and in denial about where it will all lead.  That's the status quo.  Do you carry that forward to an alternate future where that paradigm is extrapolated into some imagined Shock?  It seems like you almost have to go totally retro and imagine a world where the powerful might actually send a group of agents to literally terminate a rogue journalist before he can transmit some mythical, earth-shaking copy to a huddled mass who would actually DO something <i>if they only knew the Truth.</i>  It's otherwise difficult to create interesting opposition and tension when it's all indirect, smothering, and amorphous.  Hedonism, apathy, and despair against the gentle-handed smiling face of fascism.  Where the drama?<br/><br/>From some of your post it looks like you've got The Daily Show on your mind as well.  But they don't ask questions outside a certain paradigm either.<br/><br/>I think it's an awesome design challenge with substantial obstacles.<br/><br/>I need to get Misspent Youth; I haven't looked at it since an early playtest three and a half years ago.  Maybe I'll feel less cynical?  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Even for many of those people who know or think they know the hideously immoral reasons behind much of American foreign policy, they shrug, ask "What can I do?" and go watch Hell's Kitchen.</blockquote>\nAt least for Max Headroom, I think they were working with a budget that really wouldn't allow them to cover all aspects of the 20-minutes-into-the-future society. And it was probably more poignant for them to focus on just the dichotomy between the super-rich and the "blanks." But a lot of the issue about an apathetic public who could be shocked by the truth and yet let it go to watch TV was in the background quite a bit, I think.<br/>I was watching the first disc last night (I should be able to finish the whole series within the week...assuming I want to be able to write some games and go to work as well...otherwise, maybe I'll just finish it over the weekend...), and two episodes really kind of suggest the true nature of the average viewing public.<br/>In "Body Banks," it starts off with Edison Carter doing an expose about how their city was built upon a toxic waste dump covered up by the previous generation. Ratings for the news story were high, which suggests that it garnered a lot of interest...and yet we don't see anything really getting done about it. The Blanks went about their lives (mainly because I think they didn't feel they had much to live for, anyway), and I think the viewing audience, while they were initially calling in droves into the TV control room to voice their concern, that interest seemed to die pretty quickly. Which probably suggests that they soon were distracted by the next commercial or Kung-Fu marathon.<br/>In "Security Systems," we get an expose into the possible hostile takeover of the world's largest digital security firm. Carter's producer keeps complaining that the viewers "won't understand all of the financial figures" that Carter is reporting. At the end (just so I avoid most of the spoilers), we have an event that mirrors what happens to financially or legally troubled institutions in our day and age.<br/>Also interesting about that particular episode is we DO get to see, however briefly, the mentality of the average person 20 minutes into the future. Edison's landlord is talking to him through locked doors after his access key has been denied. The landlord expresses how there is "nothing he can do about it," and while expressing sympathy, doesn't help Edison because according to the "system," he is a wanted man. His wife even goes so far as to contact the police, because she doesn't want to go against the system.<br/>Actually quite interesting.<br/>Scarily, it is much like a future that Libertarians keep threatening will come true with big government.<br/>...like a good viewer, I'm just going to gloss over that and keep watching.<br/><br/>But yeah, if they were to redo this show (which shouldn't happen, since remakes are largely crap), they would hopefully be able to show more of the average people, to really hit home how apathy has rooted itself into their lives.<br/>Though, when you think about Cyberpunk gaming (since this is what the thread is about), how often do we really see the "average" NPCs anyway? Pretty infrequently, I would think. Aside from those that work for the megacorps that hire the characters, or the schmuck whose car gets destroyed by a PC, or as a murder victim, most Cyberpunk campaigns seem, like the Max Headroom TV show, to focus more on the super-haves, and the super-have-nots.<br/>Hmmmm...<br/>I kinda lost my train of thought.<br/>Oh well. Time to watch more Max.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284772/#Comment_284772" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-07T12:51:53+00:00" title="August  7, 2010 12:51PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stupidgremlin</cite>Ratings for the news story were high, which suggests that it garnered a lot of interest...and yet we don't see anything really getting done about it.

A well-timed news story about the horrible thing their enemy corporation has done that gets the public interest until the commercial break may never have any lasting effect, but the twenty-minute-long dip in stock prices that the (dutifully reported) public scrutiny causes sure as fuck will.  If a powerful corporation can reliably focus the attention of the apathetic underclass on something, it gives them leverage, and journalists are basically the easy-grip handle on that tool.  The fact that the public outrage dies down so fast is a feature, not a bug.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284857/#Comment_284857" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-08T15:40:59+00:00" title="August  8, 2010  3:40PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.
