You need to bring something to the community that makes people actually want to get involved and get interested beyond moon-eyed fawning. But there's <em>none</em> of that. Someone gets to be That Guy(tm) who points out its not there; I guess its my turn in the barrel.</p>\n<p>Dudes, there's nothing to <em>care</em> about here. If you want us to care, if you want us to be engaged, if you want to elicit the interest and feedback from folks who aren't sipping the Kool-Aid with pinkie in the air, you've got to actually have something to elicit feedback about. Start there. Come back when you've got something worth looking at (and given the folks who hang out here, we'll settle for even a half-page outline of how you envision play proceeding, target audience, and writing style; we're not greedy).</p>\n<p>I feel like the guy at the bank who says, "Sorry, your loan application is not going through because your business plan is crocked." But our time (well, <em>my</em> time, anyway) is valuable. I can be thinking about game design ideas with some meat rather than distracted by this.</p>\n<p>Come back when you have some meat.

I'm keen to develop something based on a cross fertilisation between them and indie games.  <br/><br/>Is there something in the water at the moment?

I'm curious about this, so I'll at least lurk for a while and see what develops. ARGs are potentially pretty powerful, but they can fizzle too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
