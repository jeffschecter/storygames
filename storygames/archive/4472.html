Essentially, I was recently struck by how much <i>Spirit of the Century</i> and <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> have in common.   I noticed this while reading through SOTC, and quickly thought "well, duh- of course they're similar- they're both based on Fudge."  That got me thinking about the essential elements of Fudge that both systems incorporated, and where they diverged.<br/><br/>I was inspired to post this now partly because of Fred's post on <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4469&amp;page=1#Item_5" rel="nofollow">awesome-o-fying Fudge</a>.  For anybody who isn't already familiar with the mechanics of these games, open versions of them are available online - <a href="http://www.crackmonkey.org/%7Enick/loyhargil/fate3/fate3.html" rel="nofollow">SOTC</a> | <a href="http://www.crackmonkey.org/~nick/loyhargil/tsoy2/book1--rulebook.html" rel="nofollow">TSOY</a> | <a href="http://www.fudgerpg.com/fudge.html" rel="nofollow">FUDGE</a>.<br/><br/>So obviously, both games use Fudge dice, and the basic, adjective-driven scale of success and failure.  Beyond that, the similarities are most clear in the essential character traits, where there are strong parallels between Aspects/Keys, Stunts/Secrets, the use (and refreshment) of Fate Points/Pools, and Abilities/Skills.  Although obviously these elements are handled somewhat differently, they form a core set of mechanics that define play.  Aspects and Keys drive player action in very similar ways, and both games would fall flat without them.<br/><br/>At the same time, both designs clearly diverged from the core framework to focus on the themes of each game, and added rules that make them great- Bringing Down the Pain, for example, helps TSOY bridge the gap with mainstream games, and gives the game a grittier feel than other more narrative games.  SOTC does a great job of making PCs heroic and tying them to each other (and the world) with a ton of Aspects right at the start of the game.  This gives players an immediate sense of their characters and the game, in a way that Gifts and Faults in Fudge simply don't manage.  <br/><br/>So without going on about it, I suppose I'm wondering if other folks have thought along these lines before, and what conclusions you might have drawn from the comparison of these game systems.  What common elements seem absolutely essential in these designs?  What departures from the core Fudge rules have been especially powerful for reinforcing the game's themes or making play more engaging?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101183/#Comment_101183" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T21:09:38+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  9:09PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Note that TSoY actually moved towards Fudge rather than being based on it - the original edition used 2d6 + skill, as I recall.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101190/#Comment_101190" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T23:43:22+00:00" title="October  4, 2007 11:43PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a lot of sweet, sweet cross-pollination between the two systems, definitely. I was totally thinking about TSOY when I made this post to my LJ at <a href="http://lcdarkwood.livejournal.com/1339.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://lcdarkwood.livejournal.com/1339.html</a>, for example (which Fred caught onto with his vast perceptive powers), and many other times besides.<br/><br/>The most common elements I see shared are in how each game's subsystems help to focus situation in play. Both Aspects and Keys are very obvious flags, telling the GM what stuff to base play around. The procedures for each are a little different, but I think the end goals are very similar.<br/><br/>In fact, a frequent occurrence on the Fate Yahoo Group is discussion about how to handle "resolving" aspects for long-term, campaign-style play, and more than one person (including me) has suggested a house rule where you "buy off" aspects much like in TSOY, gaining you an instant, full fate point pool refresh or something similar for defying that aspect in a permanent, character-changing way. The implication is, then, that play should focus around this process of creating and changing aspects as the character develops.<br/><br/>I don't really know if that answers your question, Steve, but it's what comes to mind when I think about the shared mojo. And, you know, I don't get the chance to gush about TSOY often, in context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101207/#Comment_101207" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T05:10:09+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  5:10AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's actually part of what I'm interested in- what optional or house rules do folks use to reinforce their games?

Same cost as TSoY Secrets, same function as Aspects in SotC. Then I'll of course add all the other Aspect related rules from SotC into TSoY, but'll end up with fewer Aspects per character and more impact per Aspect.<br/><br/>Two questions come to mind.<br/><br/>#1) Will the TSoY Pools and Aspects step on each others' toes or not? The latter might diminish the former's value, but that's for a play test to determine.<br/><br/>#2) Would TSoY Keys and Aspects play well together? I think they would, but again, a play test will take care of that.<br/><br/>In playing both TSoY and SotC (FATE) I find that Secrets and Stunts feel to clunky and out of place.<br/><br/>Has anyone else experimented with something similar?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
