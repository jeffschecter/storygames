Chi. It just kind of sits there and does nothing, not really. I know it's a pacing mechanic and plot immunity for the PCs, but it's a game mechanic that doesn't necessarily feed into the fiction. There's a few lines suggesting Chi loss should be fed back into the description of the next round, but it's basically an isolated meta-mechanic in a game that's all about the fiction.<br/><br/>So my suggested house rule is this: Replace Chi with Complications.<br/><br/>Complications are negative traits that characters accumulate during a conflict. They can be used as Details, if appropriate, and can be basically anything that's narratively appropriate. Characters can take one Complication to ignore one hit, just like spending a Chi in Wushu RAW, and characters can only have up to three Complications at once. Complications are considered "used" as long as the narrative results remain a factor in the fiction or are removed. If narratively appropriate, Complications can be treated as Side Goals and removed with two hits. If a Complication remains after a conflict, they can be removed with two Details describing the character handling or removing the Complication in a narratively appropriate fashion.<br/><br/>At first blush Complications might look like a "wound system", but they're more than that. Like any Trait or Detail, they can be anything really. A dropped weapon that you have to retrieve, a blade stuck in your gut, some other character that's pissed at you, a barred door... anything. As long as it's drawn from or the direct result of the Details of that round's narration, it can be a Complication.<br/><br/>I like that they can be removed during a conflict because that brings in the idea of spending some time removing them and regaining your strength or plot immunity. See any number of "breather" pauses in fights where the character is knocked into the dirt only to rally back and be seemingly unharmed. But ultimately, I like that they introduce the need to react to a conflict in some way (they're only cleared away if dealt with). Even if it's nearly being taken out (3 chi/complications) and spending as little as six Details in a quick narrative description of recovering from the conflict or putting things back to normal before moving on. The short, quiet scenes between the strictly goal-oriented conflicts that give the reader/viewer a brief pause to catch their breath. <br/><br/>So what do you think? Late night drunk post or semi-reasonable house rule? Thoughts?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445192/#Comment_445192" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-11T18:41:18+00:00" title="May 11, 2015  6:41PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like it!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TheRoleplayer" title="TheRoleplayer"><img alt="TheRoleplayer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TheRoleplayer">TheRoleplayer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445208/#Comment_445208" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-12T16:20:14+00:00" title="May 12, 2015  4:20PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll try this out next time I run Wushu!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
