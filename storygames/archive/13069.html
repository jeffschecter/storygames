I'm not sure if it was a video game or a roleplaying game because, in the dream, I was there experiencing the spy game in person, not playing it at a table or looking at a screen.  But I think the core concept would work well for both.<br/><br/>The game was very Bourne Identity influenced, but also was clearly inspired by Portal.  I was playing an operative for a black ops security company and normally lived in this penthouse up on a cliff overlooking the ocean and that's where the game started.  I wandered around my apartment, watched TV, stared out over the ocean, took showers, went swimming in my private pool, and watched other people play on the beaches far below, but never left the grounds of my home.  A delivery man dropped off simple groceries and I made basic pasta for myself, spaghetti with sauce out of a jar.  The apartment was very clean, sparse, modern, and nondescript, with only a few books and no pictures.  The walls only had abstract art which was clearly chosen by the decorator.  It was nearly impossible to get a sense of who I was from my living space.<br/><br/>Then I would get calls for missions.  The director would explain that I had to break into a secret genetics facility in Siberia, kill the scientist running the place, and make it out with all his notes.  A delivery man -- the same one who brought the groceries -- would now bring me a fake passport, plane tickets, a bag of clothes and equipment, and anything else I might need for the mission. A car pulled up and took me to the airport.<br/><br/>On the missions themselves, I had an array of abilities that made me nearly unstoppable.  The Siberian base was guarded by attack dogs, but I could sneak up behind them and snap their necks before they even smelled me.  It was similar with the guards and scientists as I climbed through ducts, scaled buildings, shot people from the shadows, etc.  There were some interesting tactical choices to make during the game but, as a whole, it was <i>all too easy</i>.  There was not a lot of challenge for me unless I screwed up and released their genetically altered giant gorilla (no kidding!) which wrecked havoc on the place, drew attention to me, and made it harder or impossible to get the files from the computers and file cabinets since he completely trashed the place.  Generally, I would burn through missions very quickly, getting in, getting out, not spending much time looking around and not caring who I was killing or why that even mattered.<br/><br/>Then I would return to my nondescript, personality-less apartment and stare out over the ocean.  I knew in my head that I could play through the entire game this way, being super successful, but never really adding any complexity or true excitement to my life, aside from the occasional mission.  And the missions couldn't tell me more about who I was.<br/><br/>Then, however, things started going south for my black ops organization.  Another of their agents apparently had messed up a mission and run, so I was assigned to track the agent down and kill them.  That started opening my eyes to the fact that things weren't what they seemed.  I started paying attention to the places they were sending me and what I was doing.  In truth, there was information and secrets all over the missions, as long as I took the time to look for them.  I started to suspect that I had been brainwashed and they were using me for their own foul purposes.<br/><br/>The next time they brought me my passport and airline tickets, I went back in my house "to get ready" and instead jumped the balcony and fell into that deep blue ocean I kept staring out over.  I beat it up the beach, startling a few of the tourists, and managed to steal a car and make it to the airport before my handlers fully knew what was happening.  But I didn't go on the mission.  Instead, I bought a ticket back to Siberia and began searching through the ruins of the genetics facility where my first mission took place -- or, at least, the first one I remember -- combing through the remaining evidence that I had overlooked the first time.<br/><br/>In truth, and I knew this in the dream, I could have decided, right from the beginning, to follow all these secrets and rebel against the conditioning and handling of the agency, but my training from other video games made me initially follow what I assumed was a linear path.  In reality, the whole game was a sandbox, where you could approach missions in whatever way you wanted.  You could abandon the mission and run for it, setting up in an apartment somewhere and hoping that the agency wouldn't come and find you (which they inevitably would).  You could turn yourself in to the authorities, where they would try to convince you to become a double agent or send you on missions against your former employers.  You could seek out the clues from your past and discover that, on some of your previous missions, you had been ordered to kill members of your family or the scientists that conditioned you, covering up -- in some cases, irretrievably -- the secrets of your past.<br/><br/>I also knew that someday I could go back to that apartment over the sea, kill the snipers and guards that were waiting for me to return and had always guarded the place, and search it top to bottom for signs of their conditioning methods and secrets they had kept from me, right under my own nose.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294534/#Comment_294534" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-24T10:55:42+00:00" title="September 24, 2010 10:55AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds cool. <br/><br/>But, shhh, Jonathan.

And, in one of your games, if your agent went AWOL and started fighting back against the agency, when you play a different slot, your other saved agent could be sent after the first and even kill them outright, preventing you from continuing play as the AWOL agent when you return to that slot.  Or, of course, the two characters could collude together or one of your characters could even awaken another to how diabolical the whole plot was.  But having interactions occur between saved characters on the same machine would be awesome.  You could even be sent to clean up after a failed operation on another slot. Or team up with another saved agent on a mission.<br/><br/>3) There should definitely be a "sex move" in this game (as in AW), whether your character has escaped and has shacked up with bystanders and accomplices (like in Bourne movies), or if they are secuding/being seduced as part of an operation, or if they're just masturbating in the shower at their ocean-view villa/prison.  And the sex move is that your character flashes back to other (female) characters in the story, including both tourists you've spied on with your binoculars from your villa deck and former lovers hidden away deeply in your memory, with scenes of violent things (real or not?) interrupting and spoiling both the sex and the flashback.  It's a way to learn information, sure, but it's like Opening Your Brain to the Maelstrom in the sense that it's also potentially dangerous and can destroy whatever situation you have going on, especially if you're in the middle of an op and are trying to play it cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294543/#Comment_294543" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-24T12:47:24+00:00" title="September 24, 2010 12:47PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

The storyline makes it clear that you're a test subject, and there have been many like you. You die often and have to revert to saves, so why not randomly generate new player models each time?  They could scatter more reflective surfaces throughout the game, just to throw the player off.  The dialogue from GladOS wouldn't even need to change...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294548/#Comment_294548" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-24T13:09:07+00:00" title="September 24, 2010  1:09PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to play that video game <i>so bad</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus" title="Ignotus"><img alt="Ignotus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus">Ignotus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294550/#Comment_294550" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-24T13:42:33+00:00" title="September 24, 2010  1:42PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is basically what I wanted bioshock to be, given it's themes.

He stumbles upon a little mountain vacation cabin with a Honda Civic parked out front.  Instinctively, I saddle up to the car, preparing to pick the lock, hop in, and hotwire the car, Grand Theft Auto-style and something I've done previously in the game a dozen times.  However, SHIT.  The handcuffs.  I don't have access to my arms, so pushing the triangle button doesn't do anything.<br/><br/>I back up and hit the attack button, bashing my face through the window of the car.  My vision swims but I lean through the window and pry up the doorlock with my teeth. Then I turn around and back up against the car door so I can grab the handle with my fingers and pop it open.  Sprawling across the seat, I look at the transmission and try to figure out a way to get the car started without my hands.  After a minute, I know it's totally hopeless.  Even if I had the keys, there's no way I could crank it started with my teeth.<br/><br/>So my only option is to get inside the cabin quick, before the gun-toting guys arrive, and convince the vacationing couple inside to hide me from the goons and smuggle me out of here.  Now I just hope I'm not going to get both them and me killed in the process.  Unfortunately, that scene never finished playing out, so I don't know what happened.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294627/#Comment_294627" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-26T03:28:08+00:00" title="September 26, 2010  3:28AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/John">@John</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/Jonathan">@Jonathan</a>: so... basically this videogame would be what Deus Ex 2 should have been. <br/><br/>Deus Ex, with much more possible branching points and more freedom to choose the next location. ^__^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294643/#Comment_294643" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-26T09:40:57+00:00" title="September 26, 2010  9:40AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2010 9:41AM by J_Walton.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess so, Renato.

I just happened to have tried Deus Ex last week, by chance. It's a pretty old game now (2003 I think) and it runs perfectly in linux (with wine) even with a lousy Intel graphics card.<br/><br/>It's got a huge following, its one of those games (like say UFO/X-COM) that continue to be played to this day despite their age.<br/><br/>You're some super-cyber-agent of the UN in a cyberpunk future. After some missions you start seeing clues that your organization might not be that humanitarian. Then, your twin brother (another super-agent) defects to the (up to that point) enemy, and tries to convince you to follow him. The overarching story is pretty much fixed (AFAICT) but the way the other characters treat yours and the dialogue can change very much depending on your choices (and based on how ruthless you are in missions, since you're supposed to be a 'policeman' and not kill people but sneak and stun instead).<br/><br/>That's why I joked about Deus Ex 2: a modern sequel to that game could well have been a mix of the original plus the freedom and sandbox play of the Rockstar games, leading to something very similar to what you and John were dreaming about. Unfortunately, judging by the stuff I read online, the actual Deus Ex 2 was a dumbed down game that lacked the depth of the original.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
