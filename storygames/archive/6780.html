I would note though that I'm a freelancer, not Atlas staff, so I can't talk about the future of the line or upcoming releases. <br/>\n* I am happy to talk about Ars issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue that I was asked to talk about in the new thread was how I play Ars, because I said I mostly play it diceless and it is crunch heavy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I've been wiriting for Ars, I've done most of my play as PbP, and most of that with dice. I do this because I know my style of play is an odd variant and people paying their money for books deserve what they expect, not my weird take on things.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore that though, I used to avoid dice quite a bit with Ars, because I generally didn't see the point of them.  Insert your standard Amber Diceless spiel here about the (un)necessity of dice.  I know Ars uses dice for spell botches, but I never saw the point of killing off PCs for doing dramatic stuff in my home games.  I know people in the wider Ars community like it, and to keep up to date its what I now mostly use, but I really never had much of a problem running Ars and saying "Always assume your roll is a 5" and using Amber style tricks to make combat more interesting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, I as a GM was already designing the monster's magic resistance to give players the chance of hitting it I wanted,  right?  I was giving it the armor I wanted, right?  In Ars, if the players are getting too easy a kill, the monster gets tougher by GM fiat, with added health levels, or, in the book example, toxic blood. So that meant I was fixing the story events regardless and giving the players the idea that what they rolled was more than a theme guide for me..so why bother?  Why not just..talk.  My main group was used to Amber...so we just worked it that way. It works - you really can play Ars like this. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know the point of spell botching is to make characters leery of casting magic in Infernal or Faerie or Divine Auras, but I didn't really ever get the point of that, in my home games.  I -know- it adds tension when you have a bigger botch pool, but I'm one of those sucker Amber GMs who really doesn't like random PC death, and so I found I'd keep trading random deaths off.  If random death doesn't work for me, and it doesn't, then I don't need the randomiser for that death.  Also, it seemed contrary, to me, for me to make the places where the bad guys would try to eat you, and your home, be the places where your magic was most likely to kill you, because that's where you spent most of your screen time. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, for some people, magicians wielding power at the fringes of their control and grapping the lightning with their fingertips is a great thing, and for them, the botch rules work really well.  For me, not so much.  I'm happy the option is there for other people: I'm not saying its a flaw in the game by any means.  I'm just saying that I like a more flowing cinematic style of game and for me, that means I tell a better story if I ditch the dice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does take some of the tension out of spontaneous spellcasting, but I think that what it loses there, and I agree it does lose something there, it makes up for in people having confidence to pull weird ideas and try them.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150904/#Comment_150904" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T13:58:54+00:00" title="June 15, 2008  1:58PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That all sounds pretty cool.  I will say in defense of the Ars die mechanic that the exploding "1" on stress rolls has led to several hugely memorable moments (rolls of 60+ when the character's back was really against the wall), but those rare moments aren't worth the hassle to me of enduring the rest of the crunch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
