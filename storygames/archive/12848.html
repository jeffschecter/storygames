Have a look.<br/><br/>Over in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12829&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Jason Morningstar's thread about tone in Apocalypse World</a>, Amnesiack wrote:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: amnesiack</cite>Interestingly, this thread is really making me think a lot about Miyazaki movies like<i>Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind</i>and<i>Princess Mononoke</i>.  In many ways, those movies feel like "verdant wastelands" as someone put it, with lots of PC-NPC-PC triangles and non-horrifying-but-still-dangerous threats.<br/><br/>Also, the anime film<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin:_Spirits_of_the_Past" rel="nofollow"><i>Origin: Spirits of the Past</i></a>fits the bill signifcantly.</blockquote>\nAnd no one really commented on it. We all agree the game can mean lots of different things to different people, and can be hacked into many shapes -- but could Apocalypse World, in its current form, really play out as a Miazaki movie? Whatever the answer to that may be, this comment immediately made me think of how beautiful those movies Amnesiack mentioned were, how sometimes bad things happened but the movies were basically about good people. But this was the exact opposite of my first impression of Apocalypse World, after reading it through the first time. In another discussion called <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12513&amp;page=1#Item_72" rel="nofollow">[Apocalypse World] love and brutality</a> I basically tried to argue that the game has doom and gloom, hate and brutality built into the very rules of the game, but tons of people wrote back to me saying, no, it's a game about hope! It was specifically written so that it wasn't just about screwing other people over. I tried and tried but couldn't see it at the time. Now I want you to show me.<br/><br/>What's the most hopeful, most beautiful thing you've seen while playing Apocalypse World?

Sammy, the Driver, was a reckless, destructive bastard, who liked to pick fights he really shouldn't, and ramp his car into the air so he could land it on his enemies. Once, when he had his brain open to the world's psychic maelstrom, I asked "So is there any line Sammy wouldn't cross?" And got, as my answer, "Sammy wouldn't hurt a kid." So of course his nemesis used a kid as a human shield. That's the sort of thing mindfuckers did, in the olden days of playtesting.<br/><br/>The kid survived, even though it meant letting Balls get away, and thanks to the magic of the ungiven future, became a PC.<br/><br/>At that point we skipped ahead a couple years, and the Kid was stylized as a diplomat, and peacemaker (operator with brokering deals, honest work, technical work, and a reputation as a smart kid with no-nonsense solutions to all problems that's really helped out everyone who has listened to him). And let me tell you, I made him struggle inch by bloody inch for every ounce of peace and friendship he eked out in that world. Everybody wanted to fuck over everybody else. Even with the expanded manipulate/seduction rules, there's only so much you can do, one person at a time? And this one time, he went to try to apologize to Barbarossa, another PC, for calling him an evil bastard or something like that, and found said PC warming himself by a bonfire made out of corpses of the villagers he and his gang just slaughtered. Seriously. That's what the Kid had to work with.<br/><br/>But he still tried. He wasn't perfect, but he was definitely trying.<br/><br/>The other thing the Kid was trying to do was find out what was beyond the world's psychic maelstrom. He had the expanded move, but not great weird, and couldn't roll that 12+ to save his life. In fact, trying it got him into more trouble than almost anything else, except that bastard Barbarossa.<br/><br/>So in the final session of the game, all the PCs, who more or less all want eachother dead despite the Kid's best efforts, are in the same area, and there's guns blazing, and people dying, and I don't even need my fronts because they're all doing it to themselves, seriously, the Kid, ultimately, zigs when he should have zagged, rolled low when he should have rolled high, and bites the bullet.<br/><br/>And the player goes "Hey, can I open my brain to the world's psychic maelstrom, in my dying moments, one last time?" And I say "Sure. Hell, new custom move, when you die, take +1 to opening your brain rolls."<br/><br/>He rolls, with that +1, a 12, <i>exactly</i>. It's like the dice gods offering their final benediction to a life spent toiling almost entirely in vain.<br/><br/>Wham! His spirit punches through the cloud of ash and smoke that have kept the earth in endless night and nuclear winter, since the Golden Age went up in flames. And a single shaft of sunlight, the first the world has seen in 50-odd years, falls upon his body, and green shoots sprout up out of the ground around him.<br/><br/>Fade to black, roll credits, good game everyone and thanks for playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" title="Kayfall"><img alt="Kayfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">Kayfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289567/#Comment_289567" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T09:08:15+00:00" title="August 29, 2010  9:08AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is truly beautiful, Ben.

If the players are all about a better world and the MC keeps throwing them up against berserker cannibal rapists, it's not going to work.<br/><br/>The players have to want to make characters who are trying to improve the world for more than just themselves and who are genuinely striving for hope and beauty.  If the MC and two players want this, but the third player just wants to pile up the corpses and kick back while they burn, it's not going to work.<br/><br/>So, I guess it's a lot easier to go dark/horrific, because a single person can easily inject that into the game.  For anything else, you really have to have everyone working in sync.  This matters a lot to me, because I will be MCing a game of AW starting in a couple of weeks, and one of my players has an extreme aversion to (as he puts it) "games that make him sad."  I'm really hoping that I can facilitate a game that is as rough and tumble as I feel AW should be but without sacrificing hope and beauty.  I'll check back in after we've started playing, and hopefully I'll have something to share.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289934/#Comment_289934" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T12:06:17+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 12:06PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2010 1:12PM by John_Harper.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">@Kayfall</a>: The "theme" of AW is what you make it.

Scarcity is one, conflict is another -- in particular, conflict due to desperation caused by scarcity is a part of any AW game, right?<br/><br/>On the other hand, the game definitely doesn't tell you, "okay now shoot and kill everyone with as much gore as possible! muahaha!" It's more like, "okay here are some people, some problems, and some weapons, what do you do?" Someone who has an urge to hurt or manipulate others can do that relatively easily, and someone who wants to make the world a better place can try to do it with a lot of difficulty, and maybe succeed, maybe not.
