Imagine something like Stardew Valley (well, harvest moon, but I've only played the former) where you mostly play out the "chore" type parts and now and then you get little scenes with the characters or little main story scenes. The chores are still fun and allow for a lot of freedom and decisions of what you want to focus on, but the story parts are also something to look forward to.<br/><br/>Now there are two challenges here, as I see it. First, making the day-to-day living not boring. It needs to be equally enjoyable as any other roleplay scene, otherwise you <i>should</i> just skip it, which is exactly what we're trying to avoid. This is certainly a challenge, but there are many videogame designs and boardgame designs that tackle these kinds of subjects (gardening, running a business, building a town) while remaining fun. This is complicated by the second challenge, which is making it a roleplaying game. I don't think it would be effective to simply bolt on some boardgame mechanics to an otherwise rpg system. There needs to be some level of integration there and the mechanics also need to allow for player character expression, in my opinion, for them to feel like you are still playing a roleplaying game. For instance, D&amp;D combat can, if you play it in a dry rules only kind of way, feel like just a boardgame bolted on to the RPG. Other games, and even D&amp;D played in a certain way, make combat include just as much character expression as other parts of the game and this feels better in my experience.<br/><br/>Why do I want this? I suppose I'm looking to recreate the coziness I feel when engaging with certain fiction where there are parts that aren't the main plot but just feel nice to live in, and you find yourself imagining all the things that you would be doing or could be doing in those worlds if you were just a regular joe and the main plot conflict wasn't necessarily there. Not sure if that makes sense.<br/><br/>Blades in the Dark long term projects are an example that I think is pretty close. I like the freeform nature, the ability to express your character via the longterm projects. It works well for this game, though its a smaller part of the game and very abstract, but perhaps abstraction is what is needed in this area. I think the idea of creating things (eg. crafting, building a castle) is something that a lot of RPG's kind of include but don't pull off especially well and is related to the ideas I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Now Gardening is not the be all and end all of my interest in this, but I thought of it as a good example of something in this category, and I challenged myself to make a mini RPG about gardening which I've done and needs a bit more playtesting.<br/><br/>I have some thoughts on the matter, but I'm afraid that I don't necessarily have the language to convey my vague ideas. <br/><br/>So what do you think? Is this coherent? What would you keep in mind if you were making a gardening RPG for example? Do you know of examples of RPG's that do things along these lines in an interesting way?<br/><br/>Now I'm definitely coming at this from a more traditional rpg (using that term broadly) perspective than full on story game, but I welcome thoughts involving both. For example I think A quiet year might have some interesting elements to draw from, though I haven't played it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChumofChance" title="ChumofChance"><img alt="ChumofChance" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChumofChance">ChumofChance</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467358/#Comment_467358" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-31T11:46:23+00:00" title="October 31, 2017 11:46AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 31, 2017 11:46AM by ChumofChance.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What you want is slice of life.

They function more as cool-down moments between scenes of action/tension, but I think the slice of life feel is still in pretty full effect.<br/><br/>And <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lcJjYz47aoVBdz9CrfAaqtdfrnc68neQUPEYeOPZOU8/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">here are the tables that make up the core of the Kancolle RPG</a>. For context, this is based on a computer simulation wargame about anthropomorphic WWII warships, and perhaps more specifically on the large volume of fan-made works focusing on the everyday lives of the characters. These table-driven scenes usually make up the bulk of the game, with one or two setpiece battles thrown in inbetween, and spending resources on crafting equipment and/or keeping your characters "life bars" topped up.<br/><br/>Since you mentioned this very concern, I should point out that this approach does end up feeling exceedingly "boardgamey" at times, owing at least in part to the fact that using slice of life events as opportunities for mechanical character growth begs for a kind of limiter on the number of times you can engage in them (otherwise you could just spam them endlessly and get way too powerful). There's lots of points-juggling, the procedure is the one in the driver's seat, and narrative player input is minimal, often being constrained to choosing between rules-defined options. "Roleplaying" is largely confined to scenery-chewing and descriptive input, and in fact these sections of these games can involve no in-character acting at all, and can just be glossed over save for the rolls and consequences (the Kancolle RPG can even be played solo, and has some published scenarios in the vein of classic CYOA-style gamebooks). I know a lot of people don't desire this amount of disconnect in a role-playing game, though I think it strikes a good compromise in attempting to meaningfully incorporate those small, cozy moments into a greater whole.<br/><br/>Anyway, sorry if that was disjointed, it's hard trying to talk about games that almost nobody is familiar with and can't just pick up and read themselves to understand. Also sorry that I mentioned Beginning Idol (a game where you play as idol singers) but didn't talk about it, as it may be the most slice-of-lifey of the three; it's essentially zero conflict and all "training, working, and/or hanging out with your friends" and the most "pure" as far as the core of the game being about progressive character building, but I don't have much concrete to share regarding the game, and this post is already getting way too long with information of dubious value. If it seems like it could be fruitful to conversation I could followup on it sometime later though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467384/#Comment_467384" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-31T17:35:30+00:00" title="October 31, 2017  5:35PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 31, 2017 5:47PM by DeReel.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To a certain extent, Ryu Tama does this, and the ancestor, R\xeave de Dragon 2e (Oniros).

Secondly, this is really interesting, as this is in line with some of the ideas I had. This idea of constant progression along with resource management and random elements. I'll have to look at the games you mention to see if it is similar to thoughts I've had. At least my thoughts were, in order to make these things interesting they need to have impact. So progression is a good way of creating a fun feedback loop and making these actions important. At the same time, you have to balance this very differently from a lot of RPG progression which confers a significant advantage since it is happening constantly. So you need both meaningful progress, that is small or constrained enough to not snowball after a month of in-fiction play for example.<br/><br/>Those tables are a cool resource, thanks for that. Interesting to look at, but too prescriptive for me in terms of RPG's. I wonder if this sort of thing could be replaced with a set of GM moves or similar, to try to move away from the board gamey feel and allow for more player choice / input.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" rel="nofollow">yukamichi</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Anyway, sorry if that was disjointed, it's hard trying to talk about games that almost nobody is familiar with and can't just pick up and read themselves to understand.</p></div></blockquote>\nNot at all that was great.

But the GM handled it well and the end of the session was pretty magical. We didn't get that deep into the mechanics though, would you mind giving a quick summary of the gathering and crafting part?<br/><br/>As for the railroaded quest part, that sounds interesting. My ideal would be a combination of overarching play to find out type quest, and slice of life mechanics.

So theoretically the "Harvest Moon tabletop game" would be one where the players iterate through a garden sheet day by day, updating numbers, checking and unchecking boxes, and making simple decisions about this activity (but mostly going by routine - the intent is not to make daily gardening decisions a harrowing strategy game, but rather to let the player express themself in small ways).<br/><br/>There are games that utilize this type of activity as part of their aesthetics. Two examples I'll mention here are <i>GURPS</i> and <i>Ars Magica</i>, both of which dedicate significant amounts of player time to calculating stuff and iterating through processes. This works in terms of the game's atmosphere and fiction because the situation the player is calculating on their papers has been firmly established in fictional terms first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rhysmakesthings" title="rhysmakesthings"><img alt="rhysmakesthings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rhysmakesthings">rhysmakesthings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467396/#Comment_467396" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-01T10:05:38+00:00" title="November  1, 2017 10:05AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm, I'm not sure that I want to achieve a feel of "everyday activity". I want the subject to be "everyday activity" but the feel to be... different. I'm not sure, but maybe with more roleplaying/expression. But I think bookkeeping is probably necessary in part.<br/><br/>The issue with making the feel an "everyday activity" is that it is not necessarily engaging, and probably not something you (read: I) would want to do as the main focus of an rpg.<br/><br/>I think Stardew Valley, at least, uses a lot of techniques to avoid the farming portions feeling simply like checking and unchecking boxes, and updating numbers. They use sound effects, visual effects, progression, and rewards systems to make this fun. This is the part I'm more interested in. Not the checking and unchecking of a box, but how to make that fun and how particularly we can use roleplaying style play to make it fun.

With that in mind, while I don't think you will find the exact answers you're looking for spelled out, I think that komradebob's "minis+" threads might contain some fruitful ideas about how the physical materials of your game can be used to maintain player engagement. <br/><br/>Rickard (and other posters, but mostly Rickard) has also made several posts over the years about 4-act "kishotenketsu" structure, something that I believe would be fruitful for constructing stories in no-conflict games. Particularly, I would conjecture that it may be a helpful way for players to contextualize events/actions that seemingly aren't connected to each other through an obvious, pre-stated objective. I'm not sure the extent to which it can be effectively baked into a system, but I do sort of suspect that it might be an issue at play in games that use a lot of random events, in impro-heavy play, and in secret-information games (like The Mountain Witch or Shinobigami).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467399/#Comment_467399" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-01T14:54:02+00:00" title="November  1, 2017  2:54PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nevertheless, I stand by what I said.

Doing say magic item crafting in Ars Magica is no less atmospheric than gardening in Harvest Moon. It doesn't have sound effects or visual cues, but it does have other players adding little tidbits of fictional detail to the process, and talking about what your character should get as a Christmas present now that they're spending another Christmas working on that one and the same project, and so on. The game has been constructed intentionally so that it requires and rewards the player for working on pretty concrete, superficial atmospheric bits, such as whether this magic item you're working on has a wooden or metallic haft.

A character sheet is already a series of spreadsheets, and in combat youre checking off spent resources (arrows, spells)  and depleting or increasing others (damage, healing) but it doesnt feel like thats all your doing.

I narrowed it down to 'doing Ars Magica right', but i see the connection with your vision of gardening.<br/><br/>I dont have the answer but I think I've found a key aspect which is 'phases'.<br/><br/>In Mouseguard  you go on GM written missions and collect points to be able to do what you want in the player's phases.<br/><br/>Blades in the Dark is the same.<br/><br/>In my zombie parkour game players had to leave their shelter and go outside (GM phase, around an hour) to collect things which can improve their characters and develop their community (Players phase, around half an hour). After the second session I realized that the players are more into the freeform community developement part and what it means for them than the running and scavenging phase.<br/><br/>So it's possible to design a game where the slice of life phase is quick but also a lot of thing happens in it (chores). Which could lead to player driven life events (marriage, etc.) in the player's phase.<br/><br/>With random tables it's very easy to make the chores phase fresh and diverse. Here I think Fiasco and Protocol.<br/><br/>I immediately envisioned my draft version of your dream game:<br/>1. In every season there are two phases: slice of life and life events.<br/>2. In the first phase every farmer has to narrate 3 'vignette' style scenes.<br/>3.A If the topics of scene are rolled on the season chart, the player gets a token. For example: pumpkin + pests. Or sunshine + watering.<br/>3.B If the player wants to invent a scene, she has to pay a token for it.<br/>4. After the 3-3 farmer vignette scene, the life event phase starts.<br/>5. Each player can direct one scene which must be about some life turning event. It can be a sudden realization, a fight between two farmers or anything like that. It's possible that these scene types can function as minigames in The King is Dead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rhysmakesthings" title="rhysmakesthings"><img alt="rhysmakesthings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rhysmakesthings">rhysmakesthings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467483/#Comment_467483" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-05T02:25:02+00:00" title="November  5, 2017  2:25AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great thoughts <a href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">@hamnacb</a> . The phases and the receiving a token for season chart / paying token for your own scene seem like they are good ideas. If I were to generalise those ideas, I'd say they both have an aspect of injecting scarcity into the personal projects / moments the players want to see for their character. This can give weight to the decision of what they want to do, even if what they're deciding to do is something small like nursing a lost animal back to health.<br/><br/>I like what you've done in your example game with this, where one of the ways to buy time for your little personal projects is to create other slice of life scenes, which means the players want to do the smaller slice of life scenes in order to buy the other scenes they want to do. Creates a nice feedback loop of a series of slice-of-life scenes as opposed to other games where the more adventurey bits are what buy you slice-of-life scenes.<br/><br/>Also general update, I'm looking into ars magica and I've purchased Chuubo's to read.

It's more about <i>discover</i> the <i>meaning</i>. When playing <b>Psychodrame</b> for the first time, the pitch included French <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_realism" rel="nofollow">social realism</a>, and my interest died a little bit. The game play were about having loong pauses and take time to establish anything. We did the setup, which included tensions in a family, and the first scene were about the dad - that we knew were absent from the family - sitting and sighing over a cup of tea, while wrestling with (any kind of) thoughts and looking at a photo. The scene were a couple of minutes long but the rest of the participants were still engaged in the scene. We all asked the question "Why?". We wanted to discover the meaning of this scene.<br/><br/>As been mentioned before, <a href="http://stilleatingoranges.tumblr.com/post/25153960313/the-significance-of-plot-without-conflict" rel="nofollow">kishotenketsu</a>. In the Korean movie <b>Memories of Murder</b>, that is based on a real story about an unsolved crime, it's not about finding out who did it but about how the detective thought. In the Korean movie <b>Hope</b>, it's not about finding out who sexually molested the child (a horrific backdrop), but how the family coped with the situation afterwards (a sweet story). It's more about understanding how other people think, than solving conflicts.

The game play were about having loong pauses and take time to establish anything. We did the setup, which included tensions in a family, and the first scene were about the dad - that we knew were absent from the family - sitting and sighing over a cup of tea, while wrestling with (any kind of) thoughts and looking at a photo. The scene were a couple of minutes long but the rest of the participants were still engaged in the scene. We all asked the question "Why?".

Do you think that the wondering is enough for a game? Or should there be some amount of resolution where the meaning is eventually made more clear. I imagine that leaving it unresolved could work well for shorter games where you can let the ambiguity be something you leave the game with and each have different ideas about, while for longer games you would want the meanings to come together or be made clear through other scenes, while introducing more scenes with unresolved meaning.
