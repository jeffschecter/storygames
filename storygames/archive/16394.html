Humor, sure; but also a way to play a variation on your character (i.e., the next clone is subtly... different). Much like having a stable of PCs for OSR play--set 'em up, knock 'em down, new flavor every couple of sessions!<br/><br/>I second Christopher's second point, too--so much so that I baked it into the GLASS rules for Player Priority games: a PC can't die unless its player Commits. He or she has said something significant about the conflict, now that death is on the table (and has also drawn every murder-hobo in the site!).<br/><br/>Finally, I think playing AS dead is a largely untapped play space. I never played Wraith; but it would be cool if more games supported PCs converting into some form of afterlife entity that can still participate WITH the rest of the PCs, not orthogonally, in parallel, or at the system level. An extension of this notion of "death, played" would include games in which death is the price of entry to play (e.g., D&amp;D-Descent-Into-Hell-type thing).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374505/#Comment_374505" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T09:44:28+00:00" title="April 26, 2012  9:44AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had more character deaths in the current Call of Cthulhu campaign that I'm playing than I've had in a while, and I have to say I like it.  We've had six deaths over little more than a dozen sessions.  I'm the only player who hasn't had a character killed yet.  Maybe I would speak differently if and when I do have a character die, but I don't think so.  In particular, I like how there isn't imposed dramatic meaning on the deaths, which contrasts with the sense of drama of many games.  <br/><br/>Character death is not under player control (although it is certainly influenced by player choices), and death is generally neither glorious nor melodramatic.  This Monday, we almost lost two characters, when three of us went into a cavern in Scotland.  The retired soldier at the end left behind one body but risked himself to save another who was knocked unconscious.  <br/><br/>Meaning is created by how the other characters react to the death later (sometimes much later), not via a death scene.  We are growing hardened to death, though.  It's not something I'd want to do for every game, but I think it is working reasonably well for us in this campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374509/#Comment_374509" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T09:54:23+00:00" title="April 26, 2012  9:54AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Character death sucks in games where you put a lot of work into create a character. If you're playing a game where you can have a new character in a few minutes, and then develop them further in play, you tend to accept death a little more readily.<br/><br/>Even so... In the Labyrinth Lord sandbox campaign I ran, my players could stat up a character in ten minutes, yet they often came to the table with detailed back-stories and developed personalities for these characters. They hated the high turn-over, and we ended up changing campaign styles (a bit of participationism and me clearly keeping them safe from bad luck, but not bad choices). I'm just saying that simple mechanics for chargen don't solve the problem entirely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374547/#Comment_374547" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T12:15:30+00:00" title="April 26, 2012 12:15PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2012 12:17PM by C_Edwards.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The upside to character death is that I get to play a lot more characters.

Resolution or long-term development of character issues and such isn't a big deal to me. I find even a small window of time that lets me explore them to be enough. There's also a sense of boredom that can set in for me in a game where character destruction isn't a thing that can happen or is incredibly unlikely to happen no matter what choices I make.<br/><br/>Back-story isn't something I tend to start play with though.

Any upset is entwined with an appreciation of the story, drama, or event from an audience type perspective. Then I smile and get excited about what's going to happen next. It's not something I sit in, as I'm far more excited about exploring what's to come, whether that be a new rpg character or continuing events in a book or television show. If these things didn't have an emotional effect on me (joy, dismay, righteous upset, etc.) I wouldn't partake of them. But the degree of my emotional response is measured by being triggered though an event that happened in some fiction or a game. They're pastimes, enjoyments, hobbies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374564/#Comment_374564" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T13:18:46+00:00" title="April 26, 2012  1:18PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way it's phrased in the thread title is telling: "Killing Characters."<br/><br/>Killing characters is usually lame.

If we did not have character death in our campaign, we would not have a real bottom-level loss condition, and thus the game would become a mere hamster wheel of patience. This feel has been remarked upon many times during the campaign: even the somewhat laborious bits of play have enhanced significance because the game is nothing like an experiental hamster wheel where you're just there to experience a ride that ends the same no matter what you do. In D&amp;D the contrast between success and failure is stark and irreversible.<br/><br/>Specifically, the "character death" here is the loss of fictional positioning and experience points. If we hypothetically played in a way that allowed the "same" characters to reappear with zero experience and without their contacts, wealth and responsibilities, then that would satisfy the structural requirements a D&amp;D campaign has in this regard. Even taking away the experience points, the dominant score-keeping device, might be sufficient to retain a clear loss condition.<br/><br/>One way of phrasing this is that without character death we don't have a clear end to the story of "how high can this guy rise before he burns in the sun".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374573/#Comment_374573" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T14:03:14+00:00" title="April 26, 2012  2:03PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C.

In LARP, one tends to build up costuming and kit to go with a particular character; and that expense combined with the expense of just playing makes folks feel far more attached and death- (but not risk-) adverse. Probably why most local LARPs run with all sorts of ways to 'save versus death.'<br/><br/>That said, I loved it when my first guy died in a LARP that had intentional death mechanics (and I was the FIRST character to go in that world). I actually, intentionally let a mob do for me, out of grief (long story). The GMs couldn't believe my first pull was a black stone (one out of, IIRC, twelve in a bag) and so they made my PC into a lich (i.e., made me up scary and buffed the hell out of me) and I went to town... literally. Great way to go, I say!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374592/#Comment_374592" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T15:01:19+00:00" title="April 26, 2012  3:01PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a lot of players work hard to empathize with their characters, and those characters -- were they alive -- would not want to die, so the players don't want them to die. (Carefully not using the I-word here, so you shouldn't either. Ha.)<br/><br/>There's something about Stance bopping around in my brain, too, but I'm not sure how valid it is.<br/><br/>At the very least, you lose fictional positioning. In some games, that is hard-gained position. No one starts out being the Conquerer of the Nine Kingdoms; you had to "earn" it through play. Probably you've also lost a lot of in-game currency: your hit points went from 50 to 5, you no longer have a +2 long sword, your gold pieces are reduced from 25000 to 80, and your level dropped from 8 to 1. If it took two years to accomplish all those things (fictional position or game currency), that's a serious investment. Starting over feels like a real loss. You have two choices: either let the players start at the "cool place" at 8th level or whatever, in which case being 8th level is no longer an achievement, or make players start over to earn their way back to the achievements, in which case death is painful.<br/><br/>Of course, if you care only about the journey, and not about any kind of achievement I'm talking about here, then you're playing a certain kind of game. People who care about those achievements are playing a different kind of game. Wisdom gleaned from one type of play must carefully be applied to the other kind of play, if at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374624/#Comment_374624" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T18:03:38+00:00" title="April 26, 2012  6:03PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They serve two equally valuable, but completely different functions.<br/><br/>Character death at the hands of dice and system function, OS (Old School) style, reinforces survival as one of the major challenges.  It got a bad rap from me for a long time because of games like those White Wolf put out, with heavy focus on story and character development, and a combat system that was enjoyable and detailed, but also surprisingly lethal with a good roll of the dice.<br/><br/>Outside of old school games, I love it in Unknown Armies and Godlike/Wild Talents (ORE). In UA, it works because the combat system makes it clear that gettig into potentially lethal fights is BAD NEWS. In fact it starts with some great text on how bad of an idea trying to murder someone else who is aware of your intentions and does not want it to happen. The players don't know their hit points, which just reinforces that.  In ORE, the tone is that, despite super powers, death still can come easy. A lucky roll, or the right superpower, can perform one hit kills reliably. WT offers some rules to make it less lethal for more traditional super hero stories (which I sometimes employ). It works for the game. In both of these games, death is rarely meaningful. It's messy and stupid. Though it still can be meaningful. I've seen more than once players in Godlike games put their characters at risk to save another. Being a hero usually gets you killed, so when they survive (or save the person and die in the process) it really makes it memorable.<br/><br/>Keep characters around if you're trying to emulate fiction, and build stories. That doesn't mean character death can't happen, it just shouldn't happen randomly. Involved players should have a say. It can suck when people disagree on a character death being important for the story. Sometimes people get too attached to characters. Other times people get too attached to the idea that Death needs to happen for a dramatic and memorable story moment.<br/><br/>This is my favored mode. I want players to get invested in their characters, understand them, and grow them. But if there's a player who wants death to strike, there's usually room to make that happen for them without putting all characters at risk. I find it best when the system forces big changes, and death is implied as an option, but not required. Like In A Wicked Age, forcing players out of play (not a big deal for a 2 hour game). Though also good when it's not on the table (like Smallville). You get really powerful moments when a player chooses to have her character die. It's the culimation of a moment. And there's nothing stopping it from being ultimately stupid and meaningless, but it's up to the players to determine that. It gives power to the group to set the tone.<br/><br/>I've heard arguments that fiction operates the first way, but that's never true in good fiction. The characters who die do so for reasons, even when those reasons are to show the cold and meaningless and randomness of death. The characters who die that way were still in the story to die for that purpose, ironically. One popular novel series about iron thrones has a famous death that seems to be random and pointless, but it's the culmination of that character's story, everything leading up to that point makes sense, and it shows that the world is not fit for characters like that, and that this world is brutal and kills its heroes and villains, as long as someone else has something to gain from it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374654/#Comment_374654" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T22:38:05+00:00" title="April 26, 2012 10:38PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I've learned two things about how I feel about death in rpgs.<br/><br/>1.

The problem is that there is a single specific, incredibly massive outcome from the random component.<br><br>Could my character randomly fall in or out of love? Randomly get have a child? Randomly discover his father presumed dead is alive? Randomly get dishonored? Almost certainly, no to all of those. Death is unique for some reason for being the only prescribed outcome for getting into a conflict.<br/><br/>All those other things can happen, but there needs to be some significant scene setting and interaction going on, in character or out, to get us there. Unlike combat systems, which are usually interesting and fun systems that I want to engage in, there's no equally compelling system for figuring out if my character falls in love or becomes dishonored in most games where random death is possible.<br/><br/>For some reason, it's recognized by many rules that fiction driven by player interaction should be a major influence in the outcomes of every single type of conflict as long as it is not physical. Once swords or guns are drawn, death is on the table, regardless of how meaningless it would seem to the fiction being created. And worse, it's often the only victory condition.<br/><br/>I have no problem with randomness. But what I want it to do is guide the fiction, not determine it. Is this action I am about to take going to benefit me, or will it cost me? That's a great question to bring to random resolution. Maybe the cost is my character's life. But maybe it's my character's honor, or the life of a person my character is trying to protect, or something else. <br/><br/>Unless a game is very specifically about life and death struggles (such as early D&amp;D and Godlike), forcing that outcome isn't just a problem with the fiction, it's completely unimaginative for the myriad of bad outcomes that might be possible in a fight that could fuel our fiction even more than a character death could in a given moment.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374735/#Comment_374735" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T11:41:31+00:00" title="April 27, 2012 11:41AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jogesh EZ</cite>Could my character randomly fall in or out of love?

"He hits\u2026and you're killed."<br/><br/>The players, for their collective part, get sad/mad when their individual characters are slain. But I have to hand it to them, they have a good attitude. After the sting of death subsides they say, "It's cool. It's not your fault. It's just the game."

As Luke says, "through dint of luck, wits and hard work." <br/><br/>I think the amount of luck required is a dial one can tune for a group's preferences. Let's say it's 99% luck and 1% wits and hard work. There's no achievement there. Even games of chance generally let you decide when to roll the dice. If it's 1% luck and 99% wits and hard work, then I'm not sure if it's as exciting. Also, I suspect "luck" fills in system here. The game designers can't enumerate all the ways to adjudicate if you fall in a pit or not, but they can give you some rules for determining the likelihood. <br/><br/>That is, it's hard to write rules for GM fiat but easier to write rules for random chance. We accept those abstractions, and they don't even have to be accurate. We accept a game's statistical probabilities as the physics of the fiction. Of _course_ I fell in the pit: I rolled a 1.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374980/#Comment_374980" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-29T20:17:44+00:00" title="April 29, 2012  8:17PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2012 8:20PM by Jim_Crocker.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because of the store, I run a lot of games for people who only play one game.

A mindful GM ought to be able to keep the story interesting and the players engaged and tense while still doling out some limited narrative immunity in the same way any skilful creator of serial fiction can.<br/><br/>It surely comes down the the common-sense rules lots of people have invoked here: be very clear about expectations and the range of possible outcomes when you sit down to play. Not everyone is a jaded, con-going grognard. Some (I'd say the majority of casual) players just want to be part of a fun ongoing narrative, and I've had 20+ years of totally awesome gaming without ever telling someone who wasn't ready to give up their avatar that the dice said different, so go in the other room and rewrite your life. People get unexpectedly fired and divorced and lose friends to car accidents and shit in real life. I only want to lay the narrative equivalent of that on them during fun time if we all agree that's what we're there for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
