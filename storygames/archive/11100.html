I'm thinking they all tie together because there are, sort of, two "factions" - monsters and humans - and rather than just straight-up conflict or violence, they fight AND dispute things and collaborate and stuff, basically wherein humans have rather complicated interactions with monsters or monstrous people.<br/><br/><img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246478/#Comment_246478" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-13T19:10:28+00:00" title="December 13, 2009  7:10PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a few different approaches here.<br/><br/>In <b>My Life with Master</b>, you play minions working for a dark master, but trying to establish loving connections from the people they prey on, in order to overcome the cycle and kill their master. It doesn't mirror Pan's Labrynth really, but definitely is THE Frankenstein game.<br/><br/>In <b>Heart of Ashes</b>, a game I'm developing, you play children who've stumbled into a dark fairytale kingdom on the brink of civil war - humans and monsters and things which are both are drawing factions and preparing for a dangerous war. You are children who must solve the problems of adults - adults who would rather use your powers than heed your advice.<br/><br/>In <b>Don't Rest Your Head</b>, you stumble into an anachronistic and nightmarish world constructed mostly out of inconsistencies and the strange. People and monsters co-exist, but there are layers and layers of pervasive fear, weirdness and mystery to wade through.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246484/#Comment_246484" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-13T19:32:24+00:00" title="December 13, 2009  7:32PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Heart of Ashes</i> sounds pretty sweet, Joe!

I can send you the most recent version of <i>Heart of Ashes</i> once I finish it up, if you'd like. Whisper me, if so.<br/><br/>2.) My Life with Master does a lot of this stuff really well, and it's worth playing at least once, if you want to design a game in its vein of storytelling.<br/><br/>3.) Pitchforks and Torches sounds awesome. The one issue is it seems like the structure would be constant attempts at niceness, abruptly endcapped by a single act of violence. It'd be nice if the story arc had more nuance and up&amp;down to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246493/#Comment_246493" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-13T20:43:16+00:00" title="December 13, 2009  8:43PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2 - Then I shall endeavor to check it out, and share it with the Thursday night crowd at the local gaming place ^_^<br/><br/>3- Thanks!
