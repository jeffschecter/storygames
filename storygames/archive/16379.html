So, being stunned - unable to act, posessed and in a trance are all rather dull for the player concerned. I'm not saying there isn't a place for it, but I'm keen to make such things more interesting.<br/><br/>Clinton mentioned that Stunning is a right bastard in 13th Age, which prompted this post.<br/><br/>Someone pointed out (might have been Graham) that in GUMSHOE, that if your mental stability is below 0, then you can't make investigative spends  which are the best way to have spotlights, narrative influence and find info to defeat your foes. Between 0 Stabilty and actual mental illness, there is a dull spot. So, I suggested that instead of being unable to use investigative abilities you have to make another Stability test when you want to use them - risking insanity. For GUMSHOE Fantasy, when characters were possessed, we gave them an internal mental landscape and let them fight their way out of it each round. <br/><br/> So, which games make you miss a turn, and what can we do about it? Perhaps you don't mind miss a turn?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374068/#Comment_374068" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-23T03:41:58+00:00" title="April 23, 2012  3:41AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FUCK miss a turn.

Ultimately it's the same issue as character elimination has: the player doesn't have anything to do while their character is out of the fight.

I chose the skill Shadow-Walk, which means you basically roll and disappear for a turn, effectively missing your turn.<br/><br/>But while I feel like I'm missing out a hair (everyone else engaging the system, doing attacks and stuff while my dude is off the board in shadow-space) I can live with it because when I reappear again I'm usually on top of someone, murdering them with a fistful -- FISTFUL -- of dice. So that's the kind of Missing A Turn I can stand. :-)<br/><br/>Stunned... haven't seen it happen. One turn would be okay, but if its one of those things that happens over and over again (oops, you lose your third turn in a row) yeah that would kind of suck I'd wager, but maybe tactically it could be countered somehow.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374073/#Comment_374073" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-23T05:51:50+00:00" title="April 23, 2012  5:51AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Missing a turn, like mind control, is a clever tool in D&amp;D 4e.

It meant I could be used for blocking doors or running wheelbarrows across ditches. That was amusing but it was a bit dull missing out on the action.<br/><br/>That said, I don't think it's too bad, it's a risk I accept to be there in combat. It's dull if it happens too often though. I know in AD&amp;D we use a lot of Time Stop and Otto's Irresistible Dance but when a PC gets hit by those, or even one of a volley of 20 Hold Persons, it's very hard being taken out the scene for the duration.<br/><br/>I can't comment on 13th Age, but games where being stunned makes it more likely for you to be stunned again, a death spiral of sorts, aren't quite so attractive.

Like, if you're fighting a medusa or basalisk, everyone knows that being paralyzed is a thing and probably involves losing the chance to do other stuff. If it's not as clear-cut as that, it's up to the GM to do the "threaten badness" thing (which you do in all games, not just AW) and establish the danger and/or the mechanics to make losing a turn interesting instead of just lame.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374115/#Comment_374115" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-23T11:46:26+00:00" title="April 23, 2012 11:46AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>There isn't as commonly a way for one player to keep other players in the action.

I love games with Team Tokens which can be used for this purpose.<br/><br/>However I do think the risk of madness, disablement or death is important, more important than the miss a turn problem it causes.<br/>I agree that the risk is important.  However, I think that in practice the risk is linked to the problem.  If disablement means that the player doesn't have fun, then the GM and/or the group are generally going to adjust things so that it doesn't happen.  So that means that the risk isn't real any more.  The best way to make the risk real, then, is to make sure that the process as a whole is still fun.  <br/><br/>In terms of game design, I think the best way is to ensure that combats resolve quickly after the first character is taken out - because the alternative ways of keeping the player involved have not been very successful in my experience.  <br/><br/>The two old solutions that I know of are: (1) having back-up characters that the player can immediately switch to, or (2) temporarily switching to play the opponents, like Rafu suggests.  Neither of these have been popular in my experience, and GMs more often fudge things to keep PCs active.  <br/><br/>(Rafu - could you say more about the design technology here?

If for any given game there are <i>things</i> that the player routinely does <i>besides</i> acting through their character, those options for action stay available to the player whenever the character is disabled.<br/><br/>You want examples, uh\u2026? Let me see\u2026\n<ul>\n<li>Sebastian Hickey's <i>Hell for Leather</i>: players portray one character each, and those characters can be removed from the fiction permanently because of death (as a consequence of player skill). Additionally, all players are responsible for bringing adversity to the table, which includes <i>challenging</i> other players. Thus, if my own character is dead, some of my play options are disabled for good, but I'm still able to bring adversity and issue challenges.</li>\n<li>Shreyas Sampat's <i>Mist-Robed Gate</i>: in the game I played two days ago, 2 PCs out of 4 were killed before the epilogue. Their <i>players</i>, though, remained as active as ever: they framed scenes and participated in resolving Wirework sequences (through their vote), despite not being able anymore to <i>initiate</i> Wirework or to employ the Ritual of the Knife.</li>\n<li>In Tim Kleinart's <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, you can always betray another's Trust, as long as there are Trust points you can pervert this way: it doesn't matter that your own character is not in the scene at all, or that you've been taken out  by a deadly wound.</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374127/#Comment_374127" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-23T14:17:12+00:00" title="April 23, 2012  2:17PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, right.

However, MW compensates by the mechanism where characters will be removed from play only in the latter stages of play and for meaningful reasons (remember, you only get removed via conflict resolution). In practice this works out so that you might be out of the last act, roughly, but your character's interests are still present - the other players need to choose whether to uphold of despise whatever it was that your character stood for.<br/><br/>In fact, I would categorize MW in the same box with the games that don't have character elimination. The same goes for all the other games where character elimination is basically up to the player. Dust Devils, TSoY... there are many games where it's entirely viable for a player to go into a violent fictional situation and just declare that they're going to give, and then the GM is obligated to continue the narrative with e.g. the character getting captured and hoisted to see the big bad as a captive. Those games don't have problems with characters dying off left and right because the players control when and if their characters are going to die.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374143/#Comment_374143" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-23T15:27:40+00:00" title="April 23, 2012  3:27PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>but they aren't something that can be dropped into other games.<br/></blockquote>\nOh, of course.

These drama games, on the other hand, are scathingly performance-based: make a character the other players don't get nor appreciate, and see how your degree of inclusion plummets. It's very easy to position your character in the fiction in a way that leaves you out of the <i>entire fight</i> (or other intense scene) in a way that is rare in the basic D&amp;D set-up. You don't even need to be a very bad player, you just need to be a bit unlucky. In D&amp;D the character concepts and activities are at least so constrained that you can sit dumb for the entire session and still be fully included in the fights.<br/><br/>But yes, there are some games that have come so close to eliminating player-sidelining as to make no difference. Games with formal turn-order and formal spotlight-distribution like Fiasco or Zombie Cinema, for example, don't really have anything you could fairly call "missing your turn", unless you include things like the player wasting his turn because he doesn't have enough skill to play. Primetime Adventures... generally, games that do formal spotlight distribution don't really get turn-missing, as the system mandates the same amount of attention and important choices to each player.<br/><br/>Whether this is somehow generally superior in comparison to games without missed turns is, of course, a complex question of rpg theory. I would be inclined to say no, if only because many games derive their zest from the creative risks involved in the choices the players make. TSoY, for example, is totally a game that I specifically want to play now and then because it provides no creative safety rails, making for an exciting ride. Create a dramatically sucky character in that game and you <i>will</i> get less turns and less interesting choices during those turns than some other player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375013/#Comment_375013" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T01:20:51+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  1:20AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero">@Eero</a> - The first such game I remember playing is My Life with Master. Everyone gets their turn, though I find such games much more a series of loosely connected stories than a team activity. I like the insight that in fact, except as an audience, everyone is missing a turn in some games, whereas the games I'm referring to the players act as a team. However, I do think there are some mechanical things you can do to reduce the issue in games where it occurs as a consequence of nature of play - so even where there is possession, charm and paralysis, you can keep players' choices interesting.<br/><br/>I am interested in how the systems of Apocalypse World and Burning Wheel reduce or eliminate these issues. How do they deal with effects which remove or disable characters physically or mentally?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
