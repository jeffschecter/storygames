Hey it's got a table of gods in it! And it says they've got an interest in the stuff the heroes do. How does this relate to what the PCs do? Is this so I can force the PCs to do the quest I want (do it or the god'll hit you)? Can my PCs fight a god? What would that look like?<br/><br/>As an aside, even though you wrote Agon under my nose, I was absent for most of the discussion and playtesting, so I don't necessarily "get" Agon.<br/><br/>And here's this game on my shelf called Nine Worlds, and it's got stats for the gods! Holy cow! These guys will kick my character's butt! What the heck kind of game is that? Is this supposed to be like when I bought Deites and Demigods and my 30th level Wizard toasted off Thor with a fireball?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102405/#Comment_102405" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T04:45:02+00:00" title="October 11, 2007  4:45AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, fine. You've given me an excuse to talk about one of my favorite games.<br/><br/>In Nine Worlds, the gods have stats precisely because you are supposed to get all up in their business and challenge their power. So... yeah. It <i>is</i> a lot like your 30th level wizard, actually. The gods have set up the universe to be a certain way. Don't like it? Challenge them to see who's boss. Do like it? You better step up and champion their cause, because there are a bunch of super-beings lined up to kick them off their thrones. That's the "core story" of the game, and the mortal/god relationship is a key driving force of play.<br/><br/>Oh, and the gods are powerful, but they are not invulnerable. A PC has a chance against any of the Immortals, if he has passion (his muses), a little help, and luck on his side. In Nine Worlds, the god write-ups are a catalog of the characters you are eventually going to beat the crap out of.<br/><br/>I haven't played a long-running 9W game yet, but I imagine this around session ten: "Remember back when Zeus was running things? Man, those were the days."<br/><br/>The other thing that 9W does that makes dealing with the gods awesome: Matt's write-ups convey the deities as <i>people</i>. You can really picture them as characters with interests and quirks rather than just symbols of power. Sure you could <i>fight</i> Apollo, but you could also just make him feel like a dick for all the shady crap he's done.<br/><br/>Let me know if this is what you're looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102417/#Comment_102417" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T07:31:49+00:00" title="October 11, 2007  7:31AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            yep, that's exacty it!<br/><br/>So how does Nine Worlds keep the GM from using the gods as a crowbar to make the players do stuff? Is it just how the game is written? Does making the gods real NPCs withe real stories stop this from happening? Is is it because mechanically the players have the means to challenge the gods? <br/><br/>I realize I should know the answer, since I've played and run Nine Worlds several tiems, but I'm really a little in the dark about the whole thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102459/#Comment_102459" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T10:29:45+00:00" title="October 11, 2007 10:29AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>antagonism means a couple of things, right? it's opposition <em>with volition</em> and <em>it can be overcome.</em> that's all.</p>\n<p>"god" is just a word and by allowing it to contaminate your thinking you've lost the essence of antagonist. that's where you have to return to the nest.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102482/#Comment_102482" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T11:22:18+00:00" title="October 11, 2007 11:22AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The gods are not that powerful in most myths.

A paternity lawyer is after them for impregnating his client while disguised as a sunbeam and they're ducking service. The golf course where they are the pro is cutting back its hours and they're worried about getting another job.

Focus on them as antagonists, not on the fact that they're labelled "gods".<br/><br/>For "god", read, maybe, "the most powerful thing in your setting that can still be an NPC." My current thinking is that "most powerful" means can mean something important. It seems to mean something in Nine Worlds, like maybe the decision of where you stand in relation to the gods is the most important decision your character has to make?<br/><br/>I'm not quite sure.<br/><br/>Here's where I'm going with this, though. In Principia I've just added the sentence "The players are more powerful than the gods." That seems to me to be an important statement that says what the players want out of the game is more important than what the gods, or GM for that matter. And it's backed up mechanically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102548/#Comment_102548" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T16:39:41+00:00" title="October 11, 2007  4:39PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That game looks very interesting, Tony!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
