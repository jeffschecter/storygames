The game is called, "<a href="http://spiffup.org/betrayers" rel="nofollow">The Legerdemain Betrayers</a>" and it focuses on contemporary, if a bit gritty, magic. It follows four characters that have just discovered there are other people out there with the ability to perform magic. Sadly, they will not get to enjoy their new discovery as they are about to be executed by this newfound community of witches and mages.<br/><br/>Betrayers' mechanics use a deck of playing cards (jokers included) rather than dice. You might find two decks a little less cumbersome than one - you'll see that it leads to less, constant shuffling though one deck is definitely enough to play with four players (not including the GM).<br/><br/>I thought I would try Story Games first because I think you all will understand the focus of the game very well. The rules fit on one page and most of the rest of the pages (20 pages of content, in all) are about how to GM the game or talk about story/world information. This is by no means a final version of the game, as a good number of extra content is missing. I am simply looking for some outside feedback, separate from my own observations of how the game works and plays. <br/><br/>If you like, you can berate me for the atrocious format of the PDF (the book layout here was not focused upon, at all - ironically, I intend to have a nice, spiffy book design for the final version) and any horrible grammar or spelling mistakes (I only gave that a cursory lookover). Hopefully, though, the mechanics of the game, as well as its setting, are clear and easy to understand . Please do ask me if you have any questions.<br/><br/>I would definitely love a general playtest report of the game, should you run it. Playtest reports are the main reason I am releasing this version, so please do feel free to email me with your report or a link to it. Alternatively, you can just post here - I don't mind either way. Specifically, I would like to hear about the difficulty of the game's mechanics (e.g. do you find Conflicts too difficult? Are there not enough options for players during Conflicts?) and how interesting, if at all, the story seems to be. <br/><br/>Anywho, I'm sure you are tired of my chatter so please download the game PDF here if you are interested: <a href="http://bit.ly/wDcPPS" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/wDcPPS</a>. Again, I would really appreciate it if you could email me with your playtest reports or post them here. You can email me at <a>static.veil@gmail.com</a>.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy the game.<br/><br/>Thank you very much,<br/>-Daniel<br/><br/>EDIT: I accidentally added an "f" to the end of the PDF download link. Should be fixed now.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
