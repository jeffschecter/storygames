It was inspired by a Norwegian forum thread called "What role-playing game would you like to see?", where a friend (\xd8ivind) wrote:\n<blockquote>A "dream game", literally, where the players are investigators in the 1800's with the ability to enter people's dreams. I imagine a game with simple rules that can guide play towards the stories, and a definitely surrealistic feel to the dream sequences. THAT'S a game I'd like to play.</blockquote>\nI made the first draft a few days after that, in February 2008. Since then, I've changed the game so many times that at times it felt like I'd completely lost track of my vision. A few times I declared that it was ready!, and then changed it again just afterwards. <br/><br/>But now I think I'm finally there. <br/><br/>I played the game at this year's HolmCon with \xd8ivind, for the first time. He was satisfied, which means that I've accomplished that goal. Other players say it's "looovely", it "scores 33 on 6D6", they're "looking forward to playing it a third time", and that it's "one of my favorite role-playing games".<br/><br/>So now it's ready for external playtest. I mailed out the very first English-language version today!<br/><br/>What's it like? Here are some key points:<br/>- Structured freeform. There are rules; there are no dice or numbers. There is no GM; there are instructors. <br/>- Rituals and ritual trappings. The game starts and ends with a banishing. There's a group cohesion ritual. You set scenes using a ouija board. <br/>- Dream. Dream sequences are the closest thing I've seen to a waking dream. Immersion-heavy techniques are based on "Silence keeps me a victim".<br/>- Exploration. There are creatures, mnemosites, living in dreams; we don't know what they are, or what they want. The game is about finding that out. In each game, the mnemosites will be different.<br/><br/>So this is me, saying "the game is here". If you want to try it out, ping me and I'll be glad to send you the playtest PDF.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh" title="Maitresinh"><img alt="Maitresinh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh">Maitresinh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259066/#Comment_259066" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-28T05:53:10+00:00" title="February 28, 2010  5:53AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i personally love the idea.

It's not that I'm religious, it's just that kind of activity makes me feel uncomfortable in a game if it's meant to be a serious thing rather than just play acting. I had the same initial response when 'the Everlasting' suggested it. Naturally it depends on how that ritual is handled. If it's little more than a series of warm-up exercises for actors then there's no big deal. But calling it a ritual and treating it like ceremonial magic... no, that strikes me as very dangerous ground to tread, psychologically.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259172/#Comment_259172" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T01:02:35+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  1:02AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2010 1:18AM by Matthijs.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ash, if you don't want to do it, don't do it.<br/><br/>[EDIT] Sorry, that was a little short. Basically what I want to say is that I've never had problems with this style of play; there are things I wouldn't do, and things I would. I've never encountered problems with rituals or phrases, hypnotic induction etc. Others say they have - that probably means there are certain games and experiences they should avoid. I'm not going to change the way I make games just because they make some people nervous, though.

Everything went according to our time plans until we hit the game - it seems that our slow thinking about each scene,<br/>the length of the scenes we played and the joking and off-topic conversations that sprang up led us to play only six scenes in<br/>the three hours- enough to get each character through their childhood and teenaged years.<br/><br/>Now, the characters are really fascinating, and what little we know of the mnemosites is incredibly intriguing. The character-generating<br/>cards worked really well, the mechanic to decide who instructs the childhood/youth scenes was neat, but since there was only three of us it didn't<br/>really impact us that much. As these things go around here, we won't be able to play this particular game with these same players again,<br/>as that we aren't guaranteed to be in the same state... ever again. Sigh. <br/><br/>With those six scenes and the conversation about how the society formed at the end of our session, i am even more excited to play<br/>the Society of Dreamers again. There were a few hard sections for me, where i expected to play "in character" only, and not affect the world<br/>around me except through the character's actions, and since the rules said nothing about this, the other players had no such issue.<br/><br/>We explored our excitement levels as well, one player's "this is fascinating" was another player's "nothing is happening". this only appeared a few times, however, and i'm sure with more experience together we could sort that out. <br/><br/>&amp; i took photos of the play session, too, but the (extremely crappy) digital camera i found at the free store managed to delete the five photographs that it was capable of carrying on the way home from the play session, which was in a lovely field surrounded by trees and rushes. Sigh. <br/><br/>here's a photo of the board i made for the session, which we didn't get to use. Next time!<br/>(pardon the extremely crappy photo. It seems easier to use this camera than dig out my other one.)<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://fallaway.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/pic1.jpg"/><br/><br/>I'm very excited about the freedom i felt during this game, &amp; the idea of providing quiet, focused activities for the players to do when the fiction isn't directly being engaged in during a scene. Very nice.<br/><br/>Matthijs - is your intent that this game mostly live in the conversation between its characters? Several of our scenes had a section wherein the protagonist was solitary, interacting with their environment. Is this what you pictured? Did you picture the instructor having more sway over the scene's backdrop once the scene has begun, or is that level ground for all players to dabble with? <br/><br/>So, in closing, a very nice afternoon in the sun, and we'll do the math on scene length next time and try to move the scenes along much more quickly.<br/><br/>as a P.S: it's less stressful to play games that i didn't make, even if it is in an early playtest stage.

The childhood and youth scenes are one of my favorite parts of the game, no wonder you wanted to stay in those scenes so long.<br/><br/>The game needs focus and efficient pacing if you're going to finish it in three hours; otherwise, it's a two-sitting game, I think. I've never played it over two evenings, though.<br/><br/>With regards to being "in character" vs. controlling the story: I want everyone to be able to do both. In a scene where I'm not the instructor, I like to portray my character, or a secondary character; I also like to describe things I see around me, events that take place, as they pop up in my head. So my intent is that everybody contributes as they see fit. Sometimes a scene has only one protagonist, and those can be great scenes; in the childhood and youth scenes, I prefer having only one player character in a scene, and other players running supporting cast.<br/><br/>Afternoons in the sun, that sounds nice <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Mmm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
