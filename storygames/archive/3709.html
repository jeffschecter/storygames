All day Friday and Saturday, and part of Sunday. Long enough to matter, not too long to get everyone sick and tired (literally!). Also, relatively easier to schedule for.<br/><br/><b>How long should game sessions be? How should they be organized?</b><br/><br/>A mix. Some people like the schedules, some do not. So, schedule slots in those hour blocks. Then, simultaneously, just provide ample, relatively quiet space for open play. (Games on demand -- that kind of thing.)<br/><br/><b>How many people is too many? How many is too few? Any particular kind of people? Who shouldn't come?</b><br/><br/>For me, personally, I'd like to be able to know several people there. The more there are, the fewer I know among the crowd. <br/><br/>Once you start to "sink" below 25 people or so, I think you start to lose cohesion and energy as a worthwhile con.<br/><br/>BUT, my dream convention is the Cannes Film Festival, the Sundance festival of Indie RPGs. <br/><br/>Bring on the people. Hundreds!  <br/><br/>But, please, leave out people with whom I'd not eat dinner with my parents. That's my new slightly humorous measuring stick. If I'd be embarassed to bring you home to meet my mom and dad, I'd prefer you stay away from the con. That means hygiene and socially acceptable behavior. It doesn't mean everyone must conform and be "normal." It means we don't put up with bullshit in the name of accepting. Accepting dysfunction and disrespect of others isn't tolerance. It's stupid.<br/><br/><b>How should time be scheduled, if at all?</b><br/><br/>See above. Slots for games. BUT!!!<br/><br/>Insert some nice breaks. Breaks for food, with plenty of time to make that happen. Let's be people, socializing. Not robots gaming nonstop. Maybe an evening session at the bar for drinks and soft drinks.<br/><br/><b>What sort of organization is in place? </b><br/><br/>I'm not sure I get the question.<br/><br/><b>What sort of interactions should be facilitated, if any? </b><br/><br/>Allowing people to both: <br/><br/>1) Play with friends, particuarly long-distance ones (Maybe somehow have a "buddy system" sign up for game slots).<br/><br/>and <br/><br/>2) Meet and play with new people who are enthused about games you're enthused about.<br/><br/><b>What's the venue shaped like? </b><br/><br/>This one's tricky. Big, loud rooms with everyoen talking like a bumblebee hum stinks for good gaming. That means hotel meeting rooms are often a pain. More private rooms would be ideal. Good luck finding such a facility.<br/><br/>Also, since this is my DREAM convention, there's a show floor for Indie publishers. The booths or tables or whatever are not a zillion dollars. They have games for sale. This is something people want, despite a handful of people mentioning they don't want a "sales" thing going on at a social gathering. Cool games I can buy from the creators! Fucking right I say!<br/><br/><b>What are the organizer's responsibilities? The participants? </b><br/><br/>The organizer has to plan and reserve the event. And, especially, make it crystal clear what attendees can expect and expect to pay.<br/><br/>Surprises suck. One aspect of this is that you need to set up a good pre-register / RSVP system that's reliable. People duck out at the last minute. So, figure out some way to not leave someone holding the bill.<br/><br/>Since I'm advocating indie sales as well, the organizer has to come up with an equitable system and payment process for handling the publishers' sales efforts (tables, sales room, etc.)<br/><br/>Given my druthers, I'd want only indie publishers and their fulfillers. So, creators and folks like IPR. Retailers, no thanks. Dice companies, etc. No thanks.<br/><br/><b>How much should you pay, and for what?</b><br/><br/>I'd pay upwards of $50 for a quality event, possibly higher. Other people have a harder time justifying such expense. I respect that. <br/><br/>I'd say that there's no way ANYONE should expect a quality event like this for less than $20. So, somehwere between $20 and $50?<br/><br/><br/>Oh! One last bit -- I'd love to see some time slots for seminars on relevant topics -- how to get a game group in your area, story-game techniques in play, how to publish and/or design games, maybe even in-con design competitions for fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83260/#Comment_83260" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T12:04:22+00:00" title="July 25, 2007 12:04PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As may be evident, I've been thinking about this lately. My dream convention scenario is that GenCon becomes a non-event in terms of the indie scene. YES, of course, the games would sell there. But, instead of it being The Scene, a new, strictly indie-RPG con would take on the role of The Scene for the year. <br/><br/>I keep thinking, very loosely, of the Cannes Film Festival or Sundance (a big, annual indie RPG con) INSTEAD OF the big summer blockbuster premier party (GenCon).<br/><br/>Man that would rock.

Adults. It should be adults. No kids.</blockquote>\nHere's an idea I've had for a while - provide activities for kids (maybe 5-12 years of age) at the con whose parent(s) are playing. This would probably only work well at a minicon, with people who know each other, and where the physical location is small enough that parents would feel comfortable leaving their kids. Possible activities could include group storytelling exercises, imagination games, The Princes' Kingdom,  Faery's Tale, simple board- and cardgames, depending on age group available.<br/><br/>I've always thought it important to involve my kids in a hobby I consider very stimulating for young minds (and they'll grow up to buy games someday, too) but it's not always easy to bring your kids to cons, for you or for other players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83873/#Comment_83873" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-29T11:39:07+00:00" title="July 29, 2007 11:39AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>I've said it before: JiffyCon is pretty much perfect.</blockquote>\nWord to that. <a href="http://jiffycon.com/" rel="nofollow">JiffyCon</a> is everything I ever wanted from a game convention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83891/#Comment_83891" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-29T15:35:39+00:00" title="July 29, 2007  3:35PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>I've said it before: JiffyCon is pretty much perfect.</blockquote>\nWord to that.<a href="http://jiffycon.com/" rel="nofollow">JiffyCon</a>is everything I ever wanted from a game convention.<br/>I really enjoyed last JiffyCon.
