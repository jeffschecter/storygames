Until now, my games have just been designed for use by my local gaming group (and my own obsessive enjoyment). However, recently I've decided that I want to attempt to develop one of my games into a more polished, complete product, and possibly to self-publish it.<br/><br/>The problem is that I have a small pile of unfinished games that I like more or less equally. All of these games have been played, but all are also very far from completion and most don't even have a real design document. This means that each of these games would take a significant time commitment to complete. I don't mind this, but I do want to be confident that I've chosen the right game to devote my time to. <br/><br/>This is where I'd like feedback. I'm going to give a brief synopsis of each game and some of my concerns, and I'd appreciate it if others could offer their opinions. I know commenting on such limited information isn't ideal, and I don't expect profound insight. I'm really just looking for a nudge in the right direction.<br/><br/>Here are the games that I'm considering:<br/><br/>- <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/48430111/Danse-Macabre" rel="nofollow"><i>Danse Macabre</i></a>. <i>Danse Macabre</i> is a largely freeform game about confronting death. Based on medieval Memento Mori art and more modern work like Bergman's <i>The Seventh Seal</i>, the game brings characters from all different social classes into contact with a personified Death. Pros: This is my most complete game, and I have a rather clear idea about how I would expand upon the design doc in the finished text. It has also provided some really interesting, compelling playtests. Cons: It's very jeepy and it's form and subject matter could potentially be off-putting to a lot of players. I'm not sure if it's likely to generate much interest.<br/><br/>- <i>Escapist</i>. Escapist is a game of parallel universes. In one universe, the players portray mundane "real world" characters, struggling with disillusionment and delusions about their abilities and self-worth. In another, they portray epic adventurers in a heroic fantasy world. Each player's two characters are mechanically and conceptual linked, so that they struggles and failures of the real life characters strengthen their fantasy counterparts. Pros: I see a lot of room for expansion here. The mechanics are unconventional without being too "out there." This has become a favorite for my players. Cons: The fantasy portions use a dice-based resolution system that is fairly simple, but still involves enough math to make me concerned about game balance. Parts of the game are in flux and there is no solid desgin doc yet.<br/><br/>- <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/48430366/Six-Page-Manual-Unfinished" rel="nofollow"><i>Six Page Manual</i></a>. This is goofy, improv-heavy parody of jeepform/"serious personal issues" RPGs. It's supposed to have a party game feel. Players roll character concepts from a chart--most of which are of the "mundane life with one big, sensational person problem" variety--and role play those characters. However, as play advances more and more ridiculous/extreme concepts are added to the original, and players have to juggle all of their character concepts as convincingly as they can. Pros: I have had a lot of fun both writing and playing it. Plenty of room to add bonus content via more charts. Cons: Pretty fringe in every possible way. Character charts are unfinished. Goofy writing style could be a turnoff. (Will have to add appendix that explains the words in conventional English.)<br/><br/>- <i>Shade</i>. Designed because I wanted to run a ghost game for Halloween and was unhappy with how most RPGs handle ghost stories. You begin the game as a human character who can be killed and become a ghost during play. Self-contained with each session contained scenes for five life stages: Childhood, Adolescence, Young Adulthood, Middle Age, and Old Age. Each player begins play with five cards, each of which includes a personality trait that character possesses. After each life stage, each player with a living character loses a card. (So characters wear down over time, becoming narrower and more extreme, withering away.) However, each card also contains a power that a ghost could possess--mysterious footsteps, cold spots, supernatural stains, etc. When/If your character dies, you flip your remaining cards and your character becomes a ghost who haunts the living PCs with the powers on the cards. Pros: Uh, hard to say.  Cons: Hasn't been playtested much. Definitely needs mechanical work. Would require designing and printing physical cards.<br/><br/>- <i>Isolation</i>. A game based on stories/film/tv episodes about characters who don't know each other but are trapped together in a small space with a timer counting down to disaster and a traitor among them. The mechanics are loosely inspired by party games like Werewolf and Mafia. Characters draw unique roles--like hero, traitor, survivor, bounty hunter--and keep them concealed from other players. Most of the mechanics involve drawing cards from a hat for tools, events, etc. and in character bartering. Pros: Lots of subterfuge. Cons: This is a competitive game, and I'm having trouble balancing the mechanics to make them as fair as possible and to prevent cheap/exploitative strategies from becoming dominant while still keeping them as simple and intuitive as possible. Also, I hate the name. Need something more exciting.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314112/#Comment_314112" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-24T09:43:15+00:00" title="February 24, 2011  9:43AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This may be Mr. Master Of The Obvious, but I'd ask my friends who had played the games which one they thought was most worth pursuing.<br/><br/>From just the elevator pitches, *Shade* makes me go "oooh!" and nothing else really grabs me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314114/#Comment_314114" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-24T10:00:09+00:00" title="February 24, 2011 10:00AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>This may be Mr. Master Of The Obvious, but I'd ask my friends who had played the games which one they thought was most worth pursuing.</blockquote>\nAbsolutely.

Sort of the reverse of gaining conditions in Mouse Guard, you would have cards which you discarded when you took damage.

I definitely appreciate it. What most you have said is probably right. This does have to be motivated by my own personal desires, obsessions, and compulsions. A also like Pau's suggestion that I make the game that offers me the greatest opportunity fr growth. (I can't say, right now, which game that is, but it's certainly something to think about.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Pitre</cite>My proposal is to hold up "Danse Macabre" next to "A Flower for Mara" and ask if it would be a good compliment to that game.</blockquote>\nThanks for letting me know about "A Flower for Mara." I do think that it has a lot in common with <i>DM</i>. <i>DM</i> is about characters facing their own deaths, while "Mara" seems to be about coping with the loss of a loved one, but they do seem to have some thematic and mechanical similarities.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Don't listen to all these auteurs and artistes. Make the game I want. The Six Page Manual sounds fun.</blockquote>\nI would really like to at least finish the charts for <i>6PM</i>. I think I would be satisfied even if I left it at that and distributed the game for free, just because I've had so much fun playing/writing it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mease19</cite>I like the concept for<i>Escapist</i>, I see in it a cycle where failures in the mundane then empower the alternate and successes in the alternate empower the mundane, ultimately resolving the character's issues. </blockquote>\nYes, this is exactly how it works. Failures in the mundane world enhance your abilities in the fantasy world. Meanwhile, failures in the fantasy world lead to uplifting events in the mundane world that generate hope for that character. That's the basic outline of it, anyway. Whether or not this leads to resolving the character's problems and building a healthier outlook or to an endless cycle of delusional hope and disappointment will depend on how the player chooses to develop their character.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>Didn't someone give you fifty bucks to develop Danse Macabre into a published game?

It's definitely playable, and I've run it a few times, usually when my group didn't feel like running something serious or as an ice breaker for introducing RPGs to nongamers. But I was always present to explain the rules, so it probably needs an appendix that explains how to play in straightforward English.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>Don't let math issues stop you from working on a game.

I'll definitely keep that in mind.<br/><br/>I've decided to move forward with <i>Danse Macabre</i>, since it is the most finished design, and since I have a pretty clear sense of how I want to expand upon and polish it. That doesn't mean I'm abandoning the other games though. I'd like to see all of them finished someday.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
