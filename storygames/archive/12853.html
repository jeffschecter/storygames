We've started an AW campaign.<br/><br/>The very best part, for me as a MC, was the beginning where we talked about the characters and their environment. After everyone'd set up their characters from the playbooks, I did the "ask questions like crazy", we drew maps, and it was beautiful to see how all of a sudden a whole environment sprung forth from seemingly nowhere. It all seemed to make sense and fit. Having a Hardholder as one of the characters is great, probably essential.<br/><br/>We experimented a bit with the characters' moves, just establishing how they worked and what was what. I did some "future badness", set up a (very) few PC-NPC-PC triangles, tried to make the world seem real. It was pretty easy, really (though, of course, I've spent a lot of time studying the rules and threads). <br/><br/>The players really seemed to like it; one commented that it was "the best RPG so far". <br/><br/>I do think, though, that this session was more fun for the players than for me, simply because they're in character so much and experience things that way. I was worried that they wouldn't have enough to do, but they did, and we had fun.<br/><br/>Looking forward to trying out the fronts and threats next time. And making more NPCs. And most of all, getting out of the hold they spent almost the entire session in. <br/><br/>Weird game thing: One character, a Brainer, got all his experience boxes checked, so he got an advance. He chose his own hold. In the fiction, that's pretty much out of nowhere, so we'll need to have something interesting happen between sessions, I think, to justify it. I considered going against it, but hey, two holds, it'll be fun.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289431/#Comment_289431" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T15:45:10+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  3:45PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, there is no explicit setting, but there's so much implicit stuff in the playbooks, moves and rules that it all emerges as a coherent world pretty easily.<br/><br/>Also, once you've done the first session and have your threats and fronts it gets easier to MC, imo. You still have to do a lot of work, but most of that is done before play, by setting up fronts, then in play you just do your moves and follow your prep, whereas in the first session you have to hold everything together, with barely any character glue to work with.<br/><br/>A second Holding right out of the door, eh? What has been established about the Brainer so far? Maybe, instead of giving him a different hold, give him the current one. Well, half of it, if you have a Hardholder PC already. Have them juke it out for control, maybe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289432/#Comment_289432" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T15:45:51+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  3:45PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite><br/>The players really seemed to like it; one commented that it was "the best RPG so far".</blockquote>\nThe most to-the-point (and true!) description of Apocalypse World yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289439/#Comment_289439" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T16:02:02+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  4:02PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2010 4:02PM by J_Walton.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dear Brainer,<br/><br/>You know how you got that holding at the end of the last session?

Like, you could clearly open with the scene where the Brainer is standing amidst the ashes of the conquered hold.  Or just have that already have happened, days or weeks ago.  Or start with their plan to conquer the hold and have that conquering be the opening scene or two.<br/><br/>Kinda depends on how you want to roll with the narrative.  Framing the opening of a session is a place where the MC is pretty powerful, since generally after that -- at least in my experience -- the players are like "Man, I'm gonna track that fucker down and shoot him in the face," so you don't have to worry about where the next scene is coming from.  But, then again, a good way to start is like, "So, X amount of time has gone by, where are you and what are you doing?"  Or you can always start with "It's noon on a Sunday.  A strange smoke cloud has appeared on the horizon [threaten badness].  What are you doing?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
