I started on RPG.net but quickly expanded to reading stuff pretty much everywhere.<br/><br/>Initially my already good games improved.  I liked a lot of what I learned from reading and, occasionally, taking place in these conversations.  But at some point the quality of those games leveled off.  Today I notice that I very rarely encounter something that makes me reconsider my games or even my approaches to RPGs generally.<br/><br/>What I want to know is whether you have had similar experiences?

A great game, a game that you leave filled with awe and love and the world a little bit different from before is a home run.  Home runs are pretty rare and that's alright.  <br/><br/>I have found that thinking critically about what makes games I participate in good has made  it so that I hit more base hits.  I assume that a game is going to be a base hit.  Strike outs and such are nights where there's something going on that doesn't have a hell of a lot to do with the gaming table anymore.<br/><br/>Home runs are still as rare, though a good system will make them easier to attain and possible with total strangers, a feat I didn' think was possible before.  I thought a home run would HAVE to be close buddies and friends, in the privacy and comfort of a buddy's home.<br/><br/>I hope that made some kind of sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elmago79" title="elmago79"><img alt="elmago79" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f41/doguiii/rdh12.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elmago79">elmago79</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68747/#Comment_68747" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-12T22:04:15+00:00" title="May 12, 2007 10:04PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi there, first post on Story Games.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm in the same curve as C.W. above. I stopped gaming just as all this theory discussions started to appear. Now I get the benefits of several years of advice and study in a single leap. Obviously, at some point I'll reach the State of the Art and I'll have to take it from there. I think critical thinking on any topic ought to pay out. If I read a critical analysis on Ulysses, it might help me understand the novel better, and therefore enjoy it better. However, the real magic of Joyce (let's get risky here and call it Art) is something else, that will happen perhaps in parallel with the analysis. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think Judd is on to something. If you don't gt that many hits, you start to feel frustrated or bored, you might quit the game, and, therefore, you're denying yourself completely the possibility of a home run. However, to get that many hits, it's not enough to practice at the start of the season, you need to keep training regularly, i. e., you need to keep your critical thinking sharp.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think theory allows you to hone your craft, but to reach a state "where you will be filled with awe and love and the world a little bit different from before" (lets call it Art again) requires an entirely different thing. However, you need to keep your wits sharp to facilitate that magic moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think C.W. original question contains another one in its formulation. How good can a game be? How good can a game become? Is there a cap somewhere? I think there is a lot of new ground to cover. Right now, theory only encompasses small niches of the role playing experience. It's very probable to assume that, ten years from now, games will be completely different. Will they be better?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68760/#Comment_68760" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-13T05:22:07+00:00" title="May 13, 2007  5:22AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome to Story Games, Rene (how does one make that accent over the -e-?).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: elmago79</cite>I think theory allows you to hone your craft, but to reach a state "where you will be filled with awe and love and the world a little bit different from before" (lets call it Art again) requires an entirely different thing.

I still appreciate that my floor for 'failure' is so much higher.<br/><br/>I've finally digested R-Maps and their relationship to reincorporation, and used it effectively in a game.<br/><br/>The best general approach/technique that I've found is a short warm-up. You have to do this right before you actually start playing (no more rules explanations, chit-chat), but if you get that right everyone starts out focused and in the same place.

The fun curve and the learning curve.  The learning curve is still climbing for me, as other have mentioned.  I can't even say that it happens is big steps.  Sure, it did at first but there are techniques that still evade me and I have to take one at a time.  just like Remi, relationship maps are something I have been exposed to for decades but for some reason I hadn't used myself.  Ganakagok (and Mendel's comment at one of my Artesia sessions)changed my mind.  I don't think I am a particularly slow study but I feel these things take time and effort to master.<br/><br/>Additionally, the other side of the learning curve lies with my players, both old and new.  So many more folks are used to "the old way" of gaming.  Now I have always been considered a good GM but now I feel like I'm spreading the wealth.  And a group of people learning together is always slower than a single sharp individual's mental climb.  I think the first game I really cut my teeth on this stuff as a group was Mortal Coil.  It was jarring and we had to adjust as we went.  But we muscled through it and came out better players as a group.<br/><br/><b>TESTIMONY</b>: The fun curve is as Judd suggests, a more steady endevour.  More of my games are fun again and I am more certain that if I go to a table of like minded folk that I'll have fun.  Conventions were a crap shoot.  I went to GenCon a couple of years back and was astounded over how bad the play was - namely by industry demoers!  I swore off GenCon.  I only came back due to the DexCon/Dreamation/Nerdly crowd assured that I wasn't wasting my money and that my fun factor was assured - no pressure  &gt;8D .<br/><br/>the end result is that my games are constantly getting better in small measurable ways.  There are assured moments of awesome within good games instead of moment of good in mediochre games.  And I don't see the trend slowing for a good while.  Certainly not until I have converted every willing soul.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>- Don<br/>aka The Burning Prophet                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69297/#Comment_69297" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T12:23:48+00:00" title="May 15, 2007 12:23PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C.W.Richeson</cite>'m certainly a relative newcomer.

Have all of the RPG basics been laid out already or is there still new ground to discover?  What is the most innovative new idea or approach to RPGs that you have encountered in the past 6 months?</blockquote>\nWhile I can't say I've seen anything that's given my gaming experience some grand, illuminating experience in the last few months, I continue to try things I read or hear about.  Doing that, I think, keeps my gaming from becoming stagnant.  So, while my gaming isn't producing any more home runs (to use Judd's language), the base hits keep coming in because we're trying little things.<br/><br/>Two examples:<br/>1. I listened to a Sons of Kyros episode around three months back, and they talked about being too comfortable at the table.  That's when I decided that I was going to stop doing dinner in the middle of our games, and it's made for a pretty good impact.<br/><br/>2. The way scenes work in Burning Empires is making us think about non-player scenes in a new light, and how they change the feel of the game, for both better and worse.<br/><br/>Neither of these are huge illuminations for us, but (to totally mix metaphors here), they're helping to keep those base hits fresh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
