Bog standard FR and Greyhawk bore me to tears. But at my core I enjoy the emergent play of D&amp;D adventures. (If not the 3.X or 4E mechanical issues. *ahem*) However it is rare in a D&amp;D edition that within the first few years my prefered play style is supported. <br/><br/>Take 2nd Edition. It wasn't until I picked up a copy of Dark Sun, Spelljammer, and Planescape that I found my nitch. I'm one of those psycopaths that LIKED 2nd Editions psionic rules, bugs and all.<br/><br/>The same could be said about 3rd Edition. I got really happy when Forgotten Reams added details about the far south (airships!) and then that excitement was eclipsed by the Eberron setting! (Airships, Psionics, robot people! oh my!)<br/><br/>4E offered me some weirdness out of the gate with Warlocks, and then the new Primal world idea from the 2nd PHBs, etc. Mind you I didn't like 4E's take on how powers worked and well. (Lets simplfiy it and say I'm heavily in the 4E was a mini's war game camp but try to be polite about it.)<br/><br/>So here I am now looking at Next with curiosity and aprehension. Hasbro/WotC's abyssmal marketing aside I feel that my playstyle is again going to be marginalized. I do have a saving grace that Pathfinder seems to have hit my 'sweet' spot but mechanically I'm looking for something that gets away from 3.X's power creep. (Something I've recently had to deal with high level Jade Regent play.) And while I hope Iron Gods will excite (and I'm sure it will.) I'm middling in my desire. Pathfinder psionics isn't directly supported by paizo and the 3rd party product while very beautiful feels like a recanning of 3.X mechanics and though.<br/><br/>So what do I do? Pick up Next, try it out and try to world build my own take on D&amp;Disms that fit closer with my more Sword and Sorcery/high fantasy weirdness vs the Tolkein idea?<br/><br/>Or well, rehased Forgotten Realms doesn't excite other. Are they going to give us Next Sword mages too? No?<br/><br/>*lament*<br/><br/>Your thoughts?<br/><br/>Are you a Fringe D&amp;D player too?<br/><br/>Do you like Psionics?<br/>Strange races?<br/>Extreme settings like Midnight, Dark Sun, Eberron?<br/>Injected technology?<br/>Setting elements inspired by earlier 60s/70's fantasy or late 80's to modern material?<br/>Etc/insert your own D&amp;D weirdness here?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe" title="mostlyjoe"><img alt="mostlyjoe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/285/nVQ8MX37HELA3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe">mostlyjoe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428713/#Comment_428713" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-24T11:58:32+00:00" title="February 24, 2014 11:58AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to give a frame of reference for each edition:<br/><br/>2E - I'm one of those nutters that dropped players into Sigil at 1st level.<br/><br/>3E- Incarnium wielder teams up with Psionic detective to battle the Dreaming Dark.<br/><br/>4E- Pirates of the Astral Sea (level 1)<br/><br/>Pathfinder - Numeria or Bust, party is 85% really NOT human.<br/><br/>While I appreciate 13th Age and Dugeon World for what they are I have to custom build a LOT to make what I want with them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428716/#Comment_428716" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-24T12:06:43+00:00" title="February 24, 2014 12:06PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I might be a fringe player too! For mysterious reasons, 4E seems to be my favorite (rather: it's the edition I tried to read a lot) but part of that was how they pushed a lot of less standard content as central. I loved having various Ardents and Seekers and Fightbrains at the table, and I liked having a table made up of a living tree and a rock person and a psychic crystal and this tiefling and this dragon. It just worked for me, personally. I liked the promise of a mixed-technological setting, and the intense premise of Dark Sun. Basically cosigning all of your bullet-points!<br/><br/>Note, I also like hitting the straight-ahead fantasy tropes as well, what with the Dwarves of the Iron Hold guarding the Shadow Gates against the Forsaken Etc, but this stuff above is gold.<br/><br/>I'm experimenting with using Planarch Codex as a base for delving into "fringe" D&amp;D content. It's a wild premise, but part to if is that you'll explore and create new content/cultures at the table, so you're all discovering some fringe content for the first time, rather than replaying a classic trope. (IMO, Planarch Codex could fit onto a Pathfinder chassis. I'm still figuring out whether Dungeon World or World of Dungeons is a better fit for my style.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428717/#Comment_428717" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-24T12:08:41+00:00" title="February 24, 2014 12:08PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Please stop me from talking too much about my Planarch game last weekend unless you want that derail, but party make-up was: mammodon, ratfolk-doppleganger, djinn-doppleganger, djinn-vampire, nirvana wasp, and this human with a demon eye, and not a single "standard" class to be seen.

I suspect if you're cool with AD&amp;D2's mish mosh of systems many of the problems in 3.0-3.5-Pathfinder are not problems for you, so I would suggest instead of chasing after Next, look into some of the third-party stuff.  Malhavoc Press did a psionics system that was pretty solid, and there are numerous setting books out there that are relatively cheap at this late date. <br/><br/>If you're looking for something that really locks down the advancement and balancing system (although it's quite a bit more complicated than 3.0+ in terms of character generation), I might check out Fantasycraft, because that one uses such clear and explicit balancing mechanisms that adding in psionics or whatnot is really easy.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe" title="mostlyjoe"><img alt="mostlyjoe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/285/nVQ8MX37HELA3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe">mostlyjoe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428724/#Comment_428724" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-24T12:37:44+00:00" title="February 24, 2014 12:37PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2014 12:37PM by mostlyjoe.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have plenty of Patfinder material to meet my 3.X needs.

I do like Next's approach with swapping +'s for feats and Background packages attaching to a class then the sub-classes built from there. Pathfinder archtypes are great but fall in to the 3.Xism issues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428822/#Comment_428822" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-26T06:22:27+00:00" title="February 26, 2014  6:22AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I too have Whitehack on the brain and believe it can address any level of weirdness you want.

(fantasy and sci-fi games respectively).<br/><br/>From the bits I've read, O.L.D. seems to be rooted in the D&amp;D tradition (thematically speaking), but without being tradition bound like OSR games or overly complex like 3e/4e.  It's also very open-ended, and compatible with it's sci-fi equivalent in ways that allow for the addition of psionics and other non-traditional weirdness.<br/><br/>Of course, it's also only in early playtests...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
