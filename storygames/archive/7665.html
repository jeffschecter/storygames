There's a lot of bars around, but people don't like busting out dice and boards and such.  But a game of cards works well even on a small bar table.<br/><br/>So I've been thinking about a game with no character sheets, no pens or paper, no dice, just a regular deck of cards.  That would make it a good "stealth" rpg for public places.<br/><br/>But then I thought: I'm probably not the only one who has thought of this.  Are there other games out there that do this already?

I don't think so, without writing another game. I mean, the pieces (the conflict rules with cards for example) could be reused in another game, but a game is not only its conflict resolution rules, and pretty much the entire game text is focused on film noir<br/><br/>2) the prisoner's dilemma endgame (with the twist that you are never sure it's really the endgame, so you are never sure you will not get payback...) is like the conflict resolution rules I talked above: it's a piece of the game, not the entire game. And in practice I have seen that doesn't work like a prisoner's dilemma. I mean, the structure of the choice is the same: who will betray/ the others. But the prisoner's dilemma it's a dilemma only if you play it to "win" (to get less prison time, or any other definition of "win"). But if there is nothing to win, if people really only want a good ending, it evolve in a table consensus-built chosen ending at that specific time of the game (that could not be the real ending). You will not get the Femme Fatale by winning conflicts, you will get her by having the other players care about your character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170272/#Comment_170272" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-20T06:59:06+00:00" title="September 20, 2008  6:59AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            timeLESS is right.

Still an interesting premise. The designer may create sheets of card-interpretations, or a rules system that makes free interpretation easy and fun. And then you may use the cards as characters too, building them as you play (with more cards, following certain rules). And the cards can be used to reesolve conflicts too.<br/><br/>Hmm ...

Its biggest drawback for you will be that it's in Russian <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br><br>It's a game about organisations. Every player describes his organisation, be it a research institute, a ninja clan, a web forum, a military force unit, a TV channel, whatever - depends only on the genre and setting they agreed on beforehand. On their turn, players acquire cards, with each card modelling one valuable member of the organisation. Aces are geniuses that die if put with low cards but can beat even Kings otherwise; Kings are best specialists the organisations have; Queens are femme fatales, "Bond's chicks", Jeanne d'Arcs, etc; Jacks act as higher leaders' most trusted; whiteskin cards are just regular folks somehow linked to the story. You can also play with Jokers - they beat Aces, but that's all what they do (let your imagination define the meaning of a Joker in every game you play - anything from avenger to kryptonite will do) . Spades are motivated by being against someone/something; clubs fight for ideals; hearts are enthusiasts and fanatics; diamonds just want money - this idea was already posted by Ryan above. After getting new cards, the player narrates who are these new characters, how they are linked to the rest, etc.<br/><br/>The game uses poker mechanics modulo some obvious tweaks (feel free to ask me for details or fill in the gaps yourself). Straights are composed of consecutive cards of the same suit and represent hierarchical teams. Pairs, sets and quads act better depending on size (say, a pair of Jacks is the same as a straight from Queen, a set of Jacks is as good as a straight from King, etc). All groups of all organisations are visible to all players. Any player on his turn can take one of his groups and attack any group of another player, in case of a "tie" the attacker wins, used cards are thrown away. The characters whose cards are beaten are somehow narrated out of the picture.<br/><br/>There are also some rules about how to take control of the "free" open cards - each turn and each time they run out there are 1d6 added from the deck (you can just replace 1d6 with a constant value like, say, a total number of players). One can always take a single card to the organisation if that organisation already has a higher card of the same suit. One can also always take any other single card that will immediately become a part of group (straight, set, pair, quad). One can also influence the free cards into getting into a group by themselves and then take all of them at once on the next turn. There are some rules on getting the higher cards, but they involve dice. If a player neither attacks, takes a card, takes a group nor makes a group, he must throw away one of his cards (does not apply for the first 3 rounds of warming up). And, of course, narrate the result.<br/><br/>This <i>might</i> seem overcomplicated, especially if you're not a poker fan. But as with any card game, the rules are extremely fast to learn when you try it.<br/><br/>I've seen this working mighty fine for 2-4 players and a variety of genres. Elite didn't win anything in that contest and some people even complained that it's not a RPG at all (hmm... I blame the lack of hit points!), but it's definitely a Story Game and if you want card mechanics, here ya go.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176749/#Comment_176749" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-29T19:33:14+00:00" title="October 29, 2008  7:33PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hey Ryan,</p>\n<p>It's Mike R., from TAG.  I just recently started browsing this forum, and I figure that I've gotta start posting somewhere, so why not add my two cents here?  Yes, the thread is a month old, but I like the idea, so here goes:</p>\n<p>I understand that this is the "Little Ideas" category, and thus the initial ideas don't have to be fully fleshed out, but "game with cards" is a pretty broad category.  There are a lot of questions to be asked (and answered), in order to narrow down what might actually be suitable.</p>\n<p>You've already mentioned that you want no character sheets.  I think that you might be hitting the right note with the idea of assigning traits to the face cards, and handing them out.  My initial thought was to assign each face card a different character archetype, and hand one to each player, creating a sort of Commedia dell'arte feel to game wherein you have the same characters appear over and over again, but in different situations (that might actually make a good soap opera game).  However, assigning specific traits to the cards and handing them out in pairs means a wider variety of characters can come about, including some interesting combinations of characteristics.  This method also helps facilitate the quick setup that you like so much from IaWA, as players don't have to think so much about what character they want to play.</p>\n<p>To what degree do you want the mechanics of the game and the feel of the game to be intertwined?  In many traditional games, dice are merely a resolution mechanic, and any fair random number generator could be used to replace them.  Do you want the cards to merely be a random number generator, or do you want to acknowledge the fact that you're playing with cards instead of something else?</p>\n<p>The former is easy, as the cards could be tacked on to pretty much any system.  For Fate, strip one suit out of the deck, assign the other three to plus, null, and minus, and for every time you would roll, just draw four cards instead.  The probabilities would be a little off (unless you draw one card at a time, and replace it in between draws, but that's clunky), but not by very much.  Or for Risus, merely draw a number of cards equal to your cliche value, and add up the totals.  And so on.</p>\n<p>The latter option, however, is where things get more interesting.  You can explore the intrinsic nature of cards in your mechanics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Like dice, cards have values.  Without using replacement, however, the probability of drawing a certain value goes down.  For example, the first card drawn is an ace, with the probability of 4/52.  The chances of the next card being an ace are 3/51.  Perhaps these probabilities can be played with?  </li>\n<li>Unlike dice, cards have also suits.  This could be replicated with dice by randomly drawing differently-coloured ones from a bag, but obviously, it's much easier with cards.  How do the combinations of suits and values affect the game? Do suits represent certain types of actions, or forms (to borrow a term from IaWA)?</li>\n<li>Cards have orientation.  Could the positions of face-down, face-up, upright, and sideways somehow be part of the gameplay?  Perhaps cards are stacked over the course of a conflict resolution?  Or perhaps face-down cards are used for a secret bidding mechanic?</li>\n<li>Cards can be drawn randomly, or handed out like assets.  Does each player get a hand of cards to choose from, facilitating player "strategy"?  Or are cards always drawn from the deck, facilitating randomness?</li>\n<li>Cards have a limit to them.  What happens when the deck runs out?  Are the cards in play shuffled back in? Is the game over?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on how you deal with these elements, you could end up with a game that feels more like a card game and less like a traditional roleplaying game, but that might actually be a good thing.  Just combining a few of these elements together, I could see a story game that plays out a bit like a card game: each player gets two face cards, representing character traits.  Then each player is dealt a hand of cards (let's say four).  The game could progress in a series of rounds, each player secretly playing a card to the table and declaring their intent within the story.  Cards are revealed, and highest value "wins" and gets to have their intent played out, bonuses being added to the value of your card if it's suit matches the suit of one or both of your character cards.  At the beginning of the next round, players each draw a replacement card.  When the deck runs out, players stop getting replacement cards, and the story within the game enters an endgame sequence, reaching a climax, and resolving with the play of the last round.</p>\n<p>That's just a few rough ideas thrown together, but maybe it could grow into something more refined.  Anyway, I just realized that this post is getting long.  I hope I've thrown out a whole bunch of ideas out there that might get your mind churning.  Or maybe you've already considered them all.  Just thought I'd put in my two cents.</p>\n<p>-Mike R.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gmdice" title="gmdice"><img alt="gmdice" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gmdice.com/prodimages/02019.jpg.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gmdice">gmdice</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176822/#Comment_176822" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-30T15:36:58+00:00" title="October 30, 2008  3:36PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I gotta have the socialization of dice in my games.

Also, everyone pretty much already knows exactly what's in both...........<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, but once a card is played it is out for the count unless you shuffle every time before you draw a card. If your game uses 3d6 you have 216 different options (big jump). With seven different styles of dice the mixture gives you numbers that are too large to count (for me anyway). This of course depends on what you are playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith cards there is after all only one deuce of clubs in a deck. Once it is played, you know it will not show again until a reshuffle. With dice, each number can come up more than once so unlike poker you can't take played cards out in your head allowing you to know what is left.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a mixture of cards and dice are best but in a bar setting I can see where this will stand out a bit too much. Cards are quiet and less obtrusive. You can always quietly rock paper scissors for those needed turning points.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option is to sit near a pool table and determine specific ball numbers. If they sink your number in say the next three shots you were successful. You of course should not have the option to ask the pool players what to shoot at. This will certainly give you a fully random event. There should also be a twist on how to do this with darts or beer pong too.<br/>\n<br/>\nPick a bar stool and when someone sits down there or gets up before sitting down or getting up from a different stool can also tell you success or failure. Sorry, my mind is always full of game ideas and I fear I just let my geek factor come through.<br/>\n<br/>\nGMDice<br/>\n<br/>\nsorry looks like blockquoting is broken in my browser so I did it the old fashion way                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
