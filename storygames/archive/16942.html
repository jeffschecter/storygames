I think the argument could be made that Fiasco also has a clear algorithm/play rubric. Penny for My Thoughts, Dirty Secrets and to some extent Umlaut and Shooting the Moon have well encoded moves that lead to semi-predictable endgames. I'd like to see more games like that and here what others think of this kind of thing.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385852/#Comment_385852" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-27T00:23:18+00:00" title="July 27, 2012 12:23AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first thought upon seeing the title was of algorithmic trading, and by extension computers playing through a thousand games of My Life With Master with one another every second.<br/><br/>On a more serious note, I tend to not be much of a fan of these games, though I've certainly had a lot of fun with them several times. I think it's because they're too easy to play sans all color. They suffer from a lack of the Asterisk World "To do it, do it" rule. The actual details of the narrative end up feeling, for me, like a thin patina scraped atop the rules superstructure, skins easily switched out. This is less evident on the first playthrough, but I find I don't get as much repeat value as I'd like.<br/><br/>With the exception maybe being Shab Al-Hiri Roach, because Regina Sutton.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385865/#Comment_385865" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-27T06:14:04+00:00" title="July 27, 2012  6:14AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ahh, in other words the whole "Games With Endgame Mechanics" thing. It was a very unique and novel idea at the time! And indeed, the games themselves can be really fun. But I've noticed that too-too procedural games for me sometimes fall into the traps that Jeph mentions.<br/><br/>There was even an oblique thing I noticed, Games With (for me) Too Much Procedure (again, for me): Agon and Nine Worlds fell into this, despite being both fun-as-shit games.<br/><br/>in 9W you have this effect where you want to interact with the world, but to do so requires constant manipulation of cards. Everything that can be done in the world is ruled by the hand of cards you have and your intention. So you're constantly sizing up everything against what you have in your hand and what you can do. It can be a little overwhelming at times.<br/><br/>In Agon, to do Anything, you need to have a scene about that Thing. So if you've gotten the crap beaten out of your characters, and you're looking to face off against a "boss battle", say for the reason that "We wanted to play this game for X Sessions/Y Months and we're at the end of that cycle", you still need to go through the procedure of, say, each character requiring their own 3-5 competitive scenes in order to restore abilities they're based on. In play, we had to say "fuck it; just heal up 3 abilities and we'll be good", but it really felt like we shorted the game, broke out of it in some way.<br/><br/>Maybe there's something to be said about games that are /too/ internally consistent? <br/><br/>Sorry, a little sidetrack from the Endgame mechanic thing, but still relevant I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385867/#Comment_385867" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-27T07:02:08+00:00" title="July 27, 2012  7:02AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sure everybody has different breakpoints for tolerating this sort of thing.

I think it's an easier sell for casual gaming because it can help the pacing of the game match the allotted real world time.  It encourages playing games to completion because there is an end in sight.  Sometimes, too much freedom in a game can be paralyzing but the hard structure gives you something to play off of.  I generally like the decision between exploring more of what's going on in the current fiction or taking one more step toward the end (for example, if things slow down in Fiasco, the option of moving to the next player's turn gives you an easy out but you could keep going with the scene if it was interesting).  I love that endgames keep everyone on the same page about establishing fiction in the early game and then everyone can see the tipping point and start wrapping up the plot threads in time for the ending.  A lot of games with an endgame built in also seem to have good replay value and/or allow you to wrap up the game and then play a sequel.  I'm not sure that having an endgame and having story structure are necessarily the same (e.g. I see Lady Blackbird as having an implied ending without imposing structure), but they often seem to go hand in hand. I'd like to see more games with structural mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385892/#Comment_385892" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-27T13:27:05+00:00" title="July 27, 2012  1:27PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I feel somewhat comforted that I'm not entirely alone in this discussion, mease19.

I'm not a good GM and although I would like to improve, the reasons I run games is to give another GM a break and to help out for various other reasons, or simply to expose new players to a game.  I would prefer if other GMs ran most games, but when I do run a game, it's nice to have some assurance that it's going to flow well, and that it's going to wrap up well (as that's mainly what the players remember).  I've played Fiasco many times and Penny for My Thoughts and Dirty Secrets once each, and I like the aspect that once you are out of dice or whatever, an automatic end game is triggered.  The first time we brought 2 new players in to a Fiasco game, the 5th player didn't even know what kind of character she was going to play until it was her scene, and then it was obvious who she should be, as there had been foreshadowing earlier in the game.  It feels like we fold all the ingredients for a recipe together during the first and second parts of Fiasco and then we see what we pulled out of the oven with the Aftermath, which we know will be a sum of most of the ingredients and will come at a predicted time.  Since so much of the rest of the game is flexible, wild and crazy, it's kind of nice to have that structure.                           </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
