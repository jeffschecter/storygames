Including a description of how the money helps us bring over more Japanese/Anime-themed games in the future.<br/><br/>Because of that, I'd say that we got easily 1/5 of our sales by people who found a pirated copy of the game, then bought a regular copy after reading it or trying it.<br/><br/>It's gotten to the point that when we see the PDF posted here or there, we see people chime in to the comments with a "Hey, check out their announcement regarding piracy, it's pretty laid back...", a link to IPR (or the original Maid site, etc)... And they're not people that Ewen and I know. The extended community is fueling those efforts, which is cool to see.<br/><br/>Still, it was really cool to have people email us (or posting to places where the game PDF was posted) telling us they bought a copy after reading and playing it (then looking up IPR stats to see, in fact, that they did actually buy a copy). <br/><br/>And in the end, yeah it's probably better than obscurity. Most people DL stuff just because it's there, without even cracking the file open to even read a page of it. If you're lucky, people will crack it open and read it. Or even play it.

I even feel that that price might be too high.</blockquote>\n(edited to clarify I didn't steal BHB)<br/><br/>Piracy aside, it is the reason I snagged it.  If a PDF is $10 or less, it is more attractive to me, sight unseen (I will go higher if I know the game is a worthwhile purchase).  I saw the price, saw the cover art, and knew at least one or two pals who would like to play it at some point and snagged it.  Was glad I did.<br/><br/>Not to pick bones, but I agonized over buying "Bounty Head Bebop" because of its much higher price-tag.  For what the PDF cost me, I could have gotten a printed version of a paperback game with many more pages.  Once I did break down and purchase it, I was much more willing to spend money on the add on for cyber-stuff.<br/><br/>I know you have to cover your costs and make a profit, but without printing and distribution costs (or lower ones from shipping distribution), you can slice the margin closer and still do well.  I wonder what pricing elements went into a pricetag so high.  Some of it, I am sure is that it is a niche game and you expect to sell fewer units, but I would love to see how PDF games get priced.  What is a good sales unit volume for an indie game?<br/><br/>I know that was disjointed, but it was something that was on my mind recently when I made that purchase - almost a month after I knew of the game and figured I would enjoy it (I do, by the way).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188744/#Comment_188744" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T19:03:39+00:00" title="January 16, 2009  7:03PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Halfjack</cite>Ideally you would now insist that I not use it so I can.</blockquote>\nI will add to any denial of permission the fact that I will boycott any game that publishes sucha  disclaimer without having gotten the permission of the author...<br/><br/>...but, face it, if its less than $10 and has a spaceship on the cover you <b>know</b> I'm gonna buy it...<br/><br/>Now, I know your game won't have a ship of the cover, as I understand it, but I know if has spaceships (and FATE goodness) inside it.
