Wrote an awesome game called "Barbarians of Lemuria" (and a bunch of other indie games, I just happen to love BoL the most).<br/><br/>It's now licensed in French. And the French, as they are wont to do, have created tons of awesome new art for the game.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.lesludistes.fr/jeu/index.php?option=com_expose&amp;Itemid=53&amp;album=38" rel="nofollow"><b>BEHOLD</b></a>.<br/><br/>The game is laid out already, kinda spartan-like.<br/><br/>Simon doesn't really have the time to go back through the thing and replace the original art with the new art.<br/><br/>But he commented that, if someone wants a free copy of the game and to test out their layout chops, he'll let you do it for him.<br/><br/>I love the game, and am interested in practicing some InDesign skills, but I simply do not have the time right now for another side-project. If no one else picks it up in a few months, though, I totally will do it to completion.<br/><br/>But anyway, if that sounds like fun to you, check it out.

In general I agree, but strange things can happen when you're converting between languages.

The only other designer I have is MS Publisher, but that isn't a great deal better, so I went with the simplest option.<br/>With regard to standard size; I have three sizes, simply because of the limitations of LULU. US Letter size and hardcovers are printed in the US and to get them sent to the UK costs a fortune. So I experimented in three sizes to give purchasers the option. (This does heavily affect my sales rank on LULU though)<br/>With regard to IPR - I sent it to Brennan and he didn't like it. So that is that, as far as IPR is concerned.<br/>I have approached Mongoose under their Flaming Cobra imprint. I have also approached Cubicle 7, under a similar deal to the Mongoose one. So this might be the way to go.<br/>I have now had a few responses to getting the thing laid out - so thanks Andy for that!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200598/#Comment_200598" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-04T10:27:49+00:00" title="April  4, 2009 10:27AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2009 10:28AM by tadk.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Simon,<br/><br/>I got a quote for a stock template yesterday from a graphics designer firm to create me a template to apply to my upcoming products, I use Word also so I know what you mean.<br/><br/><br/><a href="http://www.kempdesignservices.com" rel="nofollow">Kemp Design Services, Graphic Artists, Rendering, Layouts</a><br/><br/>$200 was the rough phone quote so you know, and waiting on final quote before I decide.

On the other hand, BoL has been getting some good web coverage and that is likely to count in your favour. FC aren't daft, they only want to publish books that they are reasonably certain will sell, and both excellent art and good provenance are strong selling points. Whichever way you look at it, it doesn't hurt to discuss things with them. If there's one thing about Mongoose Publishing, they are very approachable. I would recommend looking at all options available before making a firm decision though.<br/><br/>Didn't know Cubicle 7 were accepting submissions though. I may have to talk to them myself.<br/><br/>Oh, regarding size, have you looked at Crown Quarto? Can't remember the exact dimensions but it's about the same size as an old-fashioned school jotter book. Personally, it's one of my favourite book sizes. You've got plenty of width for a double-column spread, but the size of the book is much more manageable than letter size.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon%20W" title="Simon W"><img alt="Simon W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon%20W">Simon W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200702/#Comment_200702" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-05T02:58:48+00:00" title="April  5, 2009  2:58AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2009 2:59AM by Simon W.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you reread my post, Des, you will see that I already do a Crown Quarto version!

As Matthew said, you can get v9 for a pittance. What I'd be inclined to do is do that, then see what cheap offers Serif has for upgrading to a more recent version. The current one is X3 (13). I'm on 11... it has a number of quirks, like sometimes having to fight to make the cursor appear at the point you want on the page, but I haven't yet been motivated to shell out for an upgrade. <br/><br/>Or you can buy versions new on Amazon at pretty low cost - just saw a package with PP11 for \xa325.<br/><br/>But, again as others have said, there are tons of threads on various forums about software alternatives.

It's about half an inch out in either direction, slightly taller but slightly narrower than Quarto. As for the lack of letter size, A4 is very similar so you could probably convert to that without too much fiddling around. Assuming you can get A4 of course. I generally feel that A4 converts to Letter a tiny bit better than Letter converts to A4, but it's pretty subjective.<br/><br/>Incidentally, for low-cost layout solutions, keep an eye on computer magazine coverdisks. I got my copy of Quark from one of those, and it does everything that I really need with no license restrictions. Just make sure you check that commercial usage is OK.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
