I mean directly referenced or actually used as part of designing a character or hook or whatever, stuff that I browse that may go into some general pool of inspiration doesn't count, I count it as actually used if I can point to something in the book and say "I used that in actual play".<br/><br/>So, 70 books pass that test, though with some of them I have used one thing once.<br/><br/>That's far less books than I used to have, I have been steadily culling for over a year now, but even so it's ludicrous. It's not that everything has to be used, some stuff is OOP and hard to replace so if I ever intend to use it it would be a pain to get rid of it and then have to find it again, but that can't apply to 215 books.<br/><br/>So, those of you who've been there, how did you go about culling your collection? What did you cull it from and what down to? <br/><br/>And note, I don't consider myself a collector, I'm a gamer, but when you've only used 25% of your books in play you plainly have a collection whether you mean to or not.<br/><br/>So, assembled hordes, those of you who've been where I am now, how did you deal with that?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Flynn" title="Flynn"><img alt="Flynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Flynn">Flynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62180/#Comment_62180" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-26T14:23:05+00:00" title="March 26, 2007  2:23PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote a huge post and lost it -ARGH!<br/><br/>So instead, I will summarize:<br/><br/>Is it a game you see yourself playing the future?<br/>Does it still intrigue / interest you?<br/>Are there cool / unique rules that you want to use for inspiring later design?<br/>Is there a cool / unique setting that you want to play in (either in this or a different system)?<br/>Is there great reference information or art in the book you want to use in the future?<br/>Is it a game you don't play anymore but want to keep for nostalgia?<br/><br/>If it's not hitting hard on a few of these, it's probably not worth keeping (especially if it's a sourcebook / splatbook / supplement for a game you're not currently playing).<br/><br/>If you can play a system you're already familiar with and get a similar experience - say by using the one cool setting idea from this game - then you have derived all the value you need from the game with the "one cool setting idea" and can get rid of it.<br/><br/>I'm facing a similar problem and this is what I'm using.

Do you like having a concise collection, so that you don't feel like you are wading?<br/><br/>I think that maybe learning a bit more about your game purge might help to provide some suggestions on how to go about it.<br/><br/>First of all, don't throw any books away.<br/><br/>Some folk (like on RPG.net, etc) might be interested in trading them. Maybe an old-skooler tried one of these newfangled indie games and found it to be bunk. You could end up trading him a couple old dungeon modules for a sleek indie game that would be more likely to see actual play.<br/><br/>Personally, with my book collection (like, book books, not RPG books), I have about 30-40 books on my shelf, and a huge amount in boxes in storage at my mom's place. I like having a shelf that I know intimately, but at the same time don't want to let go of my books - it's like a timeline of my reading interests. Putting *most* of your stuff in storage somewhere is a nice way to feel like you've "culled" the shelf, without going through those pangs of loss.<br/><br/>Alternately, pick some weird, wacky old-skool stuff you'll never use, and give it to gamer friends  for Christmas. Imagine Tommy's face when he opens his gift and says, "No way, Module B-114: The Curse of the Dire Were-Rabbit, Pt. 2!"<br/><br/>Hm... alternately, donate stuff to a local con. If you have 40 books you'll never use again, toss them to con organizers to use as swag/give away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62218/#Comment_62218" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-27T01:45:08+00:00" title="March 27, 2007  1:45AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nothing is getting thrown out, most of it will get sold to a second hand games dealer here in the UK (it just takes too long to ebay it all or get rid of it through trade threads, plus trades imply my getting a ton of new stuff which I don't really need).<br/><br/>Why cull?  Firstly, games are meant to be played IMO, I'd rather someone who would play them had them than have them sitting unplayed on my shelf.<br/><br/>Secondly, I think that in a way having that vast selection hampers my actual play.  I ran a while back a game set in 1770s Naples, for which I took my CoC book, amended a character sheet, did some research and started play.  I ran a game set in the Ancient Near East, I took Paul Elliott's Zenobia, made some changes to a Runequest sheet and away I went.<br/><br/>When I actually play, I rarely use many books, and they tend to be the same ones.  But when trying to plan a game, I end up looking over shelf after shelf with so many options it gets hard to know where to start.  But, at the end of the day and at the risk of offending many here, system matters but it doesn't really matter that much.  It's far better to grab a game you're comfortable with, make a few tweaks as necessary and go play than it is to search the shelves for that one perfect system.<br/><br/>So, a mix of things really.  We don't really have local cons in London much anymore sadly, with the death of Gencon UK, there's Dragonmeet but it isn't really set up for giving as swag which is a bit of a shame really.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62219/#Comment_62219" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-27T03:53:56+00:00" title="March 27, 2007  3:53AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>Nothing is getting thrown out, most of it will get sold to a second hand games dealer here in the UK.<br/><br/>We don't really have local cons in London much anymore sadly, with the death of Gencon UK, there's Dragonmeet but it isn't really set up for giving as swag which is a bit of a shame really.</blockquote>\n<a href="http://wiki.mk-rpg.org.uk/index.php/ConcreteCow" rel="nofollow">Concrete Cow in Milton Keynes</a> is a small con that's almost local and not too long to wait (29 September).

To put things into perspective, I haven't counted my RPG books, but I store them on a 2 metre wide bookshelf.  I store mostly "Indie" games separately on a different bookshelf because they're often a different size (Games like Donjon and Unsung are in this book case though).<br/><br/>The bottom shelf is all WoD stuff from the 90s.<br/>The next shelf up is Shadowrun, Torg and Gurps.<br/>The third shelf is "Misc", that is, games which are not WoD, Shadowrun, Gurps or Torg.<br/>Just before we moved, Claire told me that I had too much stuff.  So I separated out a 1 metre stack of RPG books to stick on Ebay.  As soon as I get interweb back at my new address, I'll start ditching that stuff.<br/><br/>That's still 7 metres of gaming books.  Nobody needs that much.<br/><br/>The thing is, when Claire or one of my mates asks me why I have so much of it when I only game once a week (and lately all I ever run is indie stuff and playtests of my own games) I have a simple answer: I genuinely have a perverse pleasure in owning all those books.  Most of them have seen use at some point.  All the Shadowrun books for example were used to a greater or lesser degree while I was running various games between 1990 and 1996.  Chances are that if I ever run SR again, I'll run a short game using SR4 and never reference those old 1st, 2nd and 3rd ed books.  But the fact that I still own them means that perhaps if my circumstances change dramatically (they won't) I might have time (I won't) to write and run another sprawling SR game that uses all juicy neato cool stuff from all those books (never going to happen).  In short, having them around reminds me of the games I used to play and that makes me happy.  (Not that the new games I play now aren't just as awesome, just awesome in a different way, and remembering old awesome is also awesome)<br/><br/>I also have a similar collections of Trade Paperback comics and graphic novels.  They all make me happy, even the shit ones because they remind me of a different time.  Not a better time, but one which was good.  For many people it's music which carries these memories, and that's something I get too but for me it's also the games I played and ran and the books I read.<br/><br/>The only stuff I'm looking to ditch is stuff that I've:<br/><br/>Never read<br/>Never run or played<br/>Not likely to ever run or play any time soon<br/>Bought recently and didn't like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thwaak" title="thwaak"><img alt="thwaak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thwaak">thwaak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62239/#Comment_62239" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-27T07:35:02+00:00" title="March 27, 2007  7:35AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had two full book cases, about 1 meter wide, and 5 shelves tall, for a total of about 10 meters worth of gaming books. I never bothered counting the actual RPGs. <br/><br/>When I moved in with the woman who is now my wife, I knew I could not take it all with me. There was simply no space, and I had no access to storage that I could afford. So, much like you are doing, Max, I culled the games down to a pile that fit on one single shelf. Those games were 1) RPG's I played in my youth or had a bit of nostalgia for: Bssic and Advanced D&amp;D, Star Frontiers, Gamma World, Marvel Super Heroes, Villains &amp; Vigilantes, Psi-World, and the Amazing Engine line. And 2) RPG's I was actually playing now...which was only Savage Worlds.<br/><br/>I have since found my way to The Forge, and Story Games, so now my collection is growing again slowly, but the advantage of indie games is that they are so much smaller. I can have more on the shelf, plus they get actual play. I feel better about the games I have now then I did back then.<br/><br/>Point is, it's cool to look at a shelf full of games and perhaps feel pride in your sheer amount of goodies, but it's hoarding like a dragon. If you're not using it, and can't immediately see yourself using it...get rid of it. Keep the stuff that has sentimental value, but lose the rest. There is some pangs and twinges you'll feel after getting rid of some stuff. Maybe guilt or regret, but it does fade away.<br/><br/>Good Luck,<br/>-Brent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62250/#Comment_62250" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-27T08:58:51+00:00" title="March 27, 2007  8:58AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>So, those of you who've been there, how did you go about culling your collection? What did you cull it from and what down to?</blockquote>\nWhen I came back to the US in 2000 after living in Japan for four years, I came home with a wife, no job, and about $2,000 in the bank after various expenses. We lived with my parents for 6 weeks (which was just about the amount of time I needed to get a job and get the hell out before we killed each other). When I came back, I saw my huge bookshelves filled with all sorts of RPGs that I'd never play (or play again) or books that I'd never read again. So I spent a day or two just tossing everything.  That was a precursor to my "2 shelf only" rule for RPG collection.<br/><br/>I took all my books to the local book exchange/used book store. I would have given those away.<br/><br/>These were the days before the "Auction! Sales!" forum at RPGNet (which I've found to be very useful: I almost NEVER trade, almost ALWAYS sell (or buy)). <br/><br/>I took a day or two and put about all my collection (from TORG to Buck Rogers to dozens of AD&amp;D and AD&amp;D 2E adventures to TOON to Paranoia 2E to just about everything I owned at that point, save about a shelf of stuff including D&amp;D3e, Planescape, Dark Sun, Blue Planet and a few other games) on eBay.<br/><br/>It was totally worth it, even considering the time involved.<br/>In most cases, I would just find a cover pic for whatever I was selling (from Amazon, or Yahoo Search on Images), so that I didn't have to scan in the cover. If the product was Expensive or Rare, I would try to scan the cover in so that the buyer knew what they wanted.<br/>I would usually find a page (pen&amp;paper.net, frex) that basically had a copy of the "back cover blurb" for the game, and copied and pasted that into my description.<br/>I was honest about the condition of the book, including all cover damage, scuffing, and if it was just in plain bad condition. I got like $50 from my Paranoia 2E boxed set, even though I told them in plain, bold letters that the boxed was fucked up and held together with tape, the pages of the book were falling apart and the cover was held together with tape as well, all the pull-outs were pulled-out, and lots of yellowed paper. Talk. About. Surprised. People like honesty, though<br/>When the condition was mint or near mint, I wrote MINT or NEAR MINT in bold, describing how it was free from damage, etc, and if it had that "new book smell", I wrote that too.<br/>I always wrote that I would combine shipping on auctions.<br/>In total, when I was in the zone and using some templates I made myself, it took about 5 minutes to post auctions for RPG supplements or core books, and up to 10-15 minutes to post auctions for unusual, rare or expensive goods (it took me a little while to write description).<br/>Check into standard shipping options, and use flat rate shipping envelopes when possible.<br/>Pad the shipping price by the equivalent of $1 or 1 pound, for your troubles. Reason is that it's work to get to the post office, and also you may underestimate shipping fees.<br/>Always, when possible, allow for international puchases. About half my stuff went overseas at a high price, people from Europe and Asia going, "FINALLY, someone who will ship to me!"<br/><br/>Again, eBay can be a lot of work and I was pretty savvy even before I took upon the above project. However, it helped me get rid of my entire collection in about 1-2 days of solid work (which you can spread over a few weekends), and lots of trips to the post office. With the net sales, I was able to take my wife out to eat, and put down a deposit for an apartment.<br/><br/>These days, I don't sell NEARLY the volume of stuff that I used to. When I have a "culling" these days, it's usually about 5-10 books, not 200. When I work with lesser volumes, I do the following in order:<br/><br/>1) I ask around on local gaming lists if anyone wants to buy the game. I sell it to them the next time we meet for gaming.<br/>2) Or, I just give the game to someone as a present.<br/>3) After that, I hit up RPGNet Sales and Trades to *sell* the game. I rarely trade, cause I've got eclectic tastes; Plus, most of the stuff that I'd theoretically want to trade for, I've already bought.<br/>4) Finally, if no one is interested in buying locally or on RPGnet, I again think about giving it away free to a friend.<br/>5) If not applicable, I move it to my "put it on eBay" pile. However, these days such a pile grows slowly, as I can usually get rid of stuff via the above methods. I may have 1-2 books that I might put on eBay later.<br/><br/>Again, you were thinking maybe not eBay, but I think it's your best shot at getting a few bucks (or "shillings") for your pile of stuff. It's a bit of work, though. I think it's a good feeling, though, shedding stuff that you're not going to use, or have already sucked the marrow out of. Move it on to someone who wants it.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62258/#Comment_62258" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-27T09:30:27+00:00" title="March 27, 2007  9:30AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait, I think I've just figured out how to convince Claire to let me buy that new projector and amp I want to upgrade to...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62262/#Comment_62262" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-27T09:53:52+00:00" title="March 27, 2007  9:53AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Andy, so you know, it was a post of yours some time back that got me thinking about this in the first place.<br/><br/>You said something about having two shelves of games that you actually played and that were awesome, and I still recall (though not exactly when) looking at my own shelves and wondering where I had gone wrong.<br/><br/>As consumers, we get lulled into buying things we don't need, it's not an rpg issue so much as a modern day life issue.

However, something I learned from my wife is that sometimes you just have to go through your shit and just toss stuff you're not using. Sure, if you can pass it on or sell it quickly, awesome. But if you can't, then throw it away.<br/><br/>It's kind of a really weird experience when you do it (and this is "in general", not just RPGs).  I ended up throwing away old books and papers and stuff that just somehow clung to my life like a katamari ball. When you throw stuff away like that, you realize how much money and time and thought you waste on crap, and it becomes a bit of an affirmation not to do it again. Sort of like putting yourself in balance again. A spring cleaning for the spirit.<br/><br/>After that first grand selling of most of my games, that was like a big fix of cleanliness, like I was washing away a lot of karmic debt. It felt good, and that's why I continue to roll with the 2 shelf rule. Who knows, one day, it it turns out that I actually AM doing enough gaming that I could conceivably go through almost every game on my shelves in 2-3 years (not counting the Unplayed Games that Remain: Blue Planet, Continuum and Planescape), I might make the rule into the "3 shelf rule". Not likely, but we'll see.<br/><br/>Aaanyway, one thing that I realized recently regarding the "two shelf rule": I've been drifting into that third shelf for a while now, and couldn't quite get my brain around why.  Later, I realized that I was including all my Japanese RPGs. Which, honestly, I collect not just to play, but more to read and get inspired by. I'm actually starting to reshuffle those games into my "Japanese language study materials" shelves, and in the process it looks like I've only got about a shelf and a half of English RPGs (not including PDFs). <br/><br/>The recent downside that I realized: Nothing is Safe.  I feel a little guilty, for example, when I sell off RPGs that were written by the my friends, especially when I do it in public. On one hand, I don't want them to somehow notice it (likelihood nil, but still) and feel bad ("Didn't you like the game?" "Yeah, I played the fuck out of it, now it's time to move it on"). But in the end, nothing stops the whirlwind that keeps the house in order: Burning Empires remains, but Burning Wheel is gone. Fastlane, gone (planning on checking out the new edition if it comes out). Old Conspiracy of Shadows, gone. Old Shadow of Yesterday, gone. octaNe, gone. etc etc.And in the end, I'm moving them on to others who will eventually play those games, so the cycle continues. But it's still just a hair harder to part with a game that a friend has made, I'll usually find an excuse to keep it around for longer than I need to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62332/#Comment_62332" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-28T03:40:33+00:00" title="March 28, 2007  3:40AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2007 6:19AM by Andy.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>The recent downside that I realized: Nothing is Safe.

I seriously doubt I could get down to a 2-shelf rule. I have numerous games that take two shelves or more all by themselves, but I'm looking at those critically. RuneQuest will stay, because I do keep returning to it, and have in the past regretted missing materials (but I might dump a lot of the HeroQuest era stuff - lots of way too much setting detail that is actually difficult to use in play). D&amp;D; will never make a 2-shelf rule because I have like three shelves of D&amp;D; modules (Dungeon Magazine by itself is a shelf). But I use D&amp;D; modules in most of my games whether it's D&amp;D; or not (I've regularly used D&amp;D; modules in RuneQuest and Cold Iron). There's perhaps a shelf, or at least half a shelf, of stuff I will keep for purely nostalgic reasons. I may never play the game again, but it reminds me of the early days of gaming (so Bunnies and Burrows will stay [possibly even GURPS B&amp;B; even if GURPS as a whole is on its way out], so will Adventures in Fantasy and original white box D&amp;D;, probably Traveller). I'm not sure about my D20 stuff. I really need to thin it out dramatically. I'll probably keep most of the indie games I have (just not that many).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy current plan is to try selling stuff through our local e-mail lists to sell stuff so I don't necessarily have to deal with going to the Post Office (of course if meeting people becomes a hassle, the Post Office will have to be the route). I keep thinking about eBay but it seems like a lot of hassle. I considered bringing stuff to Powells, but the last time I did that, I got such a pitiful amount of money (should have taken it as credit and got more - oh well), and they really weren't interested in a lot of the stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197954/#Comment_197954" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-20T04:19:56+00:00" title="March 20, 2009  4:19AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apologies for the threcromancy folks, but I saw Andy had linked to this and when I read the OP I checked how many books I now own, and the answer is 217.

Except for about 10 issues, away they went.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi" title="Kobayashi"><img alt="Kobayashi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zadkin.free.fr/logoBaveuse2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi">Kobayashi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197975/#Comment_197975" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-20T06:07:52+00:00" title="March 20, 2009  6:07AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After a huge cut in my collection a few years ago (around 90% I'd say) it felt really good (I only regret my copy of Gamma World 4th and even this is pure nostalgia), but it really changed my way of buying stuff. I have only two rules now : <br/><br/>_"<i>one-shelf only</i>"<br/>_"<i>I'll buy it only if I"ll play it</i>", if it turns out I won't play it, I sell or give it.<br/><br/>And it changed my view about rpg supplements. I was a supplement whore. Once I loved an rpg I wanted everything related to it. My shelves where full of complete rpg lines (Tribe 8, Warhammer FRPG, L5R 1st, Rifts, Earthdawn 1st, etc...).<br/><br/>Now I want self contained RPGs or with enough material that I won't need to buy a supplement. There are some notable exceptions (Sorcerer &amp; Sword, Monsters for Usagi Yojimbo... and well, that's about it) but the whole "<i>this game shines when you have all the supplements</i>" thing doesn't work with me anymore. <br/><br/>At the time I sold most of my collection I started writing my own things and got to play more. Can't tell you how it's related though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197977/#Comment_197977" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-20T06:08:48+00:00" title="March 20, 2009  6:08AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I collect.

I'll leave some game books around in different places with stickers on them that say "This game is yours if you want it" or something to that effect. That's gonna make some gamer's day, I'm sure.
