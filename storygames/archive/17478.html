These last two years the game has taken an even longer hike in that direction; with the summer games.<br/><br/>The summer games of <i>Fabula</i> lets a lot of players play at the same time, for a whole week, creating new player-groups each day (so your character join forces with very different characters throughout the week). Two sessions each day, and between the sessions we all go for a walk in the woods. The walks works as a mediator for the larger fiction; the players share their experiences, make deals, play in-character, and make the world come alive in a way no single group can achieve.

Once something happened it happened in the "official" version of the world. Things like that are put out by their bimonthly Magazine that is split between an intime Newspaper part and a real world perspective news about the game and sourcematerial / rules part. They also influence the world how it is described in sourcebooks and the way official adventures and campaigns are going. Usually in each adventure or campaign influencing the background there are a few notes about what will for sure have happened in Aventuria (the world of the dark eye). Like for example: "In the middle of the year the town is taken by the invading army. The evil wizard is never heard from again in history, use him like you please. In the end a new ruler is established (see his description on page XXX)" or something like that. Too railroady for many but I think the only way it works for a big productline. People still need to buy lots of publications to get all the stuff that is going on, a good way to sell books of course, but too expensive for lots of people.<br/>The amount of text is a problem for non-german language version of the Dark Eye too. It lives from the deep and evolving background. With translations bound to be month behind I can see how the sucess is lacking.<br/><br/>The metaplot however can be influenced by the players in multiple ways. For example before a change is made or a major new product is put out the authors usually are touring conventions and asking people for expetations and opinions. That happens on the internet too, now that it is well established.<br/>At conventions they have a promotion team running games too, that influence the world. The outcome is noted after the game and the players asked for their opinion. This too influences how that event gets included into the background. If you play enough of these promotion games you will be able to send in a character of yours and have it show up somewhere in a publication.<br/>They are open for contributions to their magazine too, so motivated players can send in articles and influence the game world that way, even if they do not work as freelance authors really. It gives a lower barrier of entry for those interested and an opportunity for the publisher to find talented writers. In the same vein they are doing at least one adventure writing contest each year and the winners usually get published in some way. Either over the internet for free or in a book. Plus finding talent again.<br/>They do polls too sometimes. For example if there is an election in a country in Aventuria they let the players vote and nowadays the outcome will be what happens in the world. (There was one of those elections in the early days of the game that led to some drama between authors) One guy got his character into official aventuria by campaigning in forums for him to be voted as a write in for that election and it worked out.<br/>Before the internet was big there was the play by mail feudalsystem (now it is mostly play by email and wiki editing). Being an early modern world people could become nobles and courtiers of their own plot of land and do stuff in the minor nobility that would often become official. Descriptions of nobles and their lands would go into sourcebooks. It became rather elitist and "incestuous" over time and so it lost some importance. Still a big part of the developing background too and lots of intrigues and warfare is still played that way. The authors just are more careful about how much they are using these days. Still some of the nobles in books are someones PC too, which is not especially noted and sometimes they just might die in some peoples campaign or be completely different persons. Still they share some described details.<br/>They tried the asking how the adventure ended thing too but recently I did not see too much of it. Never really worked out with planning I think.<br/><br/>A new development is Yearbooks that will be published. With the important changes over the last year and the adventures ran at the conventions. Should be cool but they did not print the first one yet, I imagine it helps people who do not want to buy every adventure and magazine or who simply can't attend conventions.<br/><br/>In short: They are asking the players to participate and make steps in the players direction. Which has been a policy for many of the almost 30 years of the game running. Not everything was gold or worked out. But they kept doing it and trying out new ways of including players in the development of the world.<br/>Also they are sticking to the history that is established, even if it sometimes hinders the way adventures can go. It gives a deep background and continuity though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395906/#Comment_395906" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T09:32:54+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  9:32AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience it hurts the game at the table more than it helps the game in full. <br/><br/>"All" the adventure are pretty railroady so there is not much free space at the table. This also means that players want to play the railroady adventures because they want to know what happens in the metaplot. So GMs have to be extra carefull when doing there own adventures because they could "destroy the metaplot" it also makes it hard to play big figures in history or even children from a specific noble or rich family because everyone in this family is described (and probarly has a statblock)<br/><br/>There is a bit of NPCs always save the day - the PCs are just some Shmugs going on. <br/><br/>In the end it is really hurting the german RPG scene because it's the main game being played (together with Shadowrun, DnD and WoD) and i think indie like ideas may have it even harder here then elsewhere because of the firm grip of DSA that has influenced players really hard. <br/><br/>The GM-Guidebook is also pretty horrible, telling you basically "do what you want with the rules - no one cares and it's your game anyway". <br/>Someone made a good case that it is disfunctional because it tries (and claims) to serve all kinds of playertypes/creative agendas. The rules on the other hand are fairly gamist/simulationist in their nature but the introductiory text reads more like narativism. The adventures/scenarios on the other hand are really railroady and ilusionistic - making it hard to get a specific agenda right with this game. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395908/#Comment_395908" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T10:03:02+00:00" title="November  2, 2012 10:03AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You are right about a certain amount of railroading being necessary for the whole persistant world idea to work and it probably is not for everyone.<br/>I made mostly good experiences with the whole thing, but everyone knew that they wanted to experience a story that was shared by many players and so certain things would have to happen. Neither me nor the other GMs in my groups had much problem with tailoring the adventure to the group though. It is some work and rarely discussed in the adventures.<br/>I did not read the GM-Guidebook, but I can guess what you say is true. The rules are dysfunctional in some ways and DSA is a game most people I know play despite the rules and for the background. (People that know about existing alternatives and make an informed choice to play the game. Many players only ever play DSA, like D&amp;D in the english speaking regions)<br/>They try to be an universal choices a little more than the system allows. Still in recent years the published campaigns are getting influenced by new ideas too. You get a few open or sandboxy ones now and the NPCs saving the day thing has been reduced.<br/>DSA sure comes with it's own set of preconscieved notions and baggage of problems. Like D&amp;D. Different problems though that influence the gamers and market in a different way.<br/><br/>It still is a long running "persistant" rpg world and an impressive body of work. I wouldn't know any other system or background outthere that really compares in that regard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395915/#Comment_395915" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T11:13:55+00:00" title="November  2, 2012 11:13AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Warhammer comes close i think and has A LOT of ideas that seem to resonate together from what i know.

Still; I'm not sure you have to be so stiff in applying persistency, even at that scale.<br/><br/>The persistency I described in relation to <i>Fabula</i>, is done in formats which are wide open to player input. There are no scenarios with defined endings. And a lot of game-play is done in sandbox-format. The heart of it is to let players communicate freely, and to let some inconsistencies be; they may be contributed to different points-of-view. <br/><br/>When inconsistencies surface in play, we deal with them off-hand; leader saying; "THIS is what counts, for now", and then play continues. Players are masters of dynamic thinking, when it comes to it, so they adapt to new realities in the blink of an eye.<br/><br/>However; reading about DSA makes me think I should try this out in a larger scale with <i>Fabula</i> too, when the next edition is published.<br/><br/>And moreover; having such a thing present and active in a game with multiple dimensions or a dream reality, would be very exciting; <br/>- then several conflicting truths could be true at once! <br/>That would be very interesting to play out, in a player-base with free input on the game world. May be the key to making a grand world of multiple realities come alive ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh" title="Maitresinh"><img alt="Maitresinh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh">Maitresinh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396208/#Comment_396208" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T13:04:58+00:00" title="November  4, 2012  1:04PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            interesting ! <br/>But i was rather thinking of something that don't exist yet (but could), a sort of hybridation tabletop RPG / tablet / online gaming.<br/><br/>For exemple, you play as a normal "tabletop rpg" but you make all your "moves" on a tablet. if you blow a castle, kill a king, the background is updated.
