I have yet to run any of these things, but that doesn't stop me from wanting to.<br/><br/>I'm curious what fresh bananas you've found, whether you've actually done something with them or set them aside to ripen a little before addressing them in a gaming setting.<br/><br/>Here are a few I've found:<br/><br/><b>3:16</b> \u2014 Before it became the polished, for-pay game that it is today, you could find <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/316" rel="nofollow">the rough draft</a> available for free.  Sure, it's not the same thing \u2014 the commercial version is a lot more organized in terms of play \u2014 but all the rudiments are there.  It's what made me acquire a copy of the for-pay edition, but I never would have heard about it if not not for 1KM1KT.<br/><br/><b>Carry</b> \u2014 Another game that's since gone on to become a commercial product.  Again it's not as polished as what would follow, but what do you want for free?  I've never run or played <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/carry" rel="nofollow">the game</a>, but that doesn't mean I don't want to.  I doubt my own ability to run it properly, though, which means this will likely remain on my virtual shelf until I have a new group I'm comfortable enough with to take some risks.<br/><br/><b>Dungeon Squad: Adventures in the 41st Millennium</b> \u2014 <i>Dungeon Squad</i> is one of the games found on 1KM1KT that I'd really like to run (I don't know what's stopping me), and not just because of <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/dungeon-squad-adventures-in-the-41st-millennium" rel="nofollow">this mod</a>, which allows gaming in the world of <i>Warhammer 40,000</i>.  From what I've heard, it really works well.  This is on my short list of experiments to try.<br/><br/><b>Krone</b> \u2014 If you saw <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=247731" rel="nofollow">my latest post</a> to the "Show me the game you want" thread, then you know why I want to play <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/krone" rel="nofollow">this game</a>.  It's stripped down to its bare essentials, and I'm not sure how seriously we're supposed to take it, but it's a raw mix of barbarians, nobles and evil sorcerers  and that's good enough for me.<br/><br/>Okay, your turn.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248510/#Comment_248510" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-25T03:26:59+00:00" title="December 25, 2009  3:26AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, it's Left Coast.  This game really, really grabbed me when I first saw it.  I revisit it every so often.  It clearly has procedural holes I'd have to fill myself if I wanted to play it.  I was really, really hoping the designer would develop it more.  I recently saw some posts over on The Forge about it which has excited me to no end.

It's basically The Chronicles of Riddick meets Rush's 2112.<br/><br/>There's another one I loved, I can't find it now, it's from Game Chef 2007 and I forget the author, but it was a kind of TORG meets EVERWAY meets MMO game, where you created your abilities from this universal list, and visited 12 worlds (each world named after an astrological symbol). You could level up your character, break them down into their component numbers, then build them back up again, complete differently.
