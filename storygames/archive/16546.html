I am looking for feedback and initial impressions of my new project. Keep in mind that I am not a professional game developer, just a nerdy kid with starry eyes and more IQ than good sense)<br/><br/>Last night I had a vision.<br/><br/>It was at around midnight, when I was starting to get into that state of mind when my craziest and most amazing ideas start springing up. It was after a binge of cartoons, and I was starting to really feel the magic (more on that in a later post).<br/><br/>I saw a story that is not read, but experienced.<br/><br/>I saw a game that allowed me to be the hero in a story never told, in a world of my creation.<br/><br/>I saw myself being Batman.<br/><br/>\u2026Okay, let\u2019s back up a bit.<br/><br/>When I was a kid, I was enraptured in and enamored with a world of popular media. Television, movies, cartoons, comics, video games, and yet other mediums yet to be explored. I saw worlds that followed rules mine didn\u2019t: the rules of narrative, drama, and thema. In these worlds, everything happened for a reason, everything turned out okay in the end, and everyone involved had a hell of a time. The laws of physics were merely a suggestion, whereas Rule of Cool and sensawunda reigned supreme. I wanted so badly to live in those worlds, to be a part of the stories they had to tell and experience the wonders they had to offer. I wanted it so badly it made my head spin and my heart ache.<br/><br/>I wanted to be Batman.<br/><br/>If I was lucky, I could be Batman in my dreams. But just when I was ready to give up my life in reality to live in my own subconscious, I woke up and had to go to the school where they taught me that trying to be Batman is stupid.<br/><br/>I found various things that promised they could let me be Batman. Tabletop RPGs tried to utilize the creativity of real people to fashion a collaborative story in which I was Batman. Video games invited me to a virtual world where I could (supposedly) pilot the actions of my own Batman. And of course, there was good old fashioned running around the park with plastic swords and tree-branch wands, which out of the three I participated in the most as a kid.  None of them, ultimately, delivered on their promise, though I still love all of them for what they are (the last, unfortunately, is usually mocked when performed by people my age).<br/><br/>By the time I had grown out of running around the park with black underwear over my pants, I had resigned to the fact that I was not, in fact, Batman. And no-one could make me Batman (not legally, anyways).<br/><br/>This was not a good time in my life.<br/><br/>But I moved on. I figured that although I could never be Batman, I could still talk about Batman, and read his stories, and maybe write my own. But even now, as a teenager, I still have that faint urge to don a pair of black underwear, put on the mask my mom made me, and leave this senseless and ugly world behind.<br/><br/>Now, I\u2019m sixteen and have a couple years of programming, game design, and writing experience behind me. I\u2019m dreaming big, expanding my knowledge of current technologies, and finally starting to realize that maybe I can really be Batman after all, even if I\u2019ll have to settle for pixels on a screen rather than Gotham City.<br/><br/>This is my dream. This is my mission. To create a system for the creation of computer games specifically and specially designed to allow myself and people like me to be Batman. I\u2019ve started calling it the Magic Engine.<br/><br/>Let\u2019s give it a fucking shot!<br/><br/>(Note: In my next post, I\u2019ll give a more theoretical and less dramatic explanation of what my goals are with this project.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd" title="Jon_Shepherd"><img alt="Jon_Shepherd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/nFIK1HGFYHAN0.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd">Jon_Shepherd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379003/#Comment_379003" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-20T12:21:15+00:00" title="May 20, 2012 12:21PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2012 12:21PM by Jon_Shepherd.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The last post - my vision - was mainly the motivations driving me to create the Engine. Here is what I actually plan to create.<br/><br/>The Magic Engine is (or will be) an engine for creating computer games which present the player with\xa0scenarios\xa0which the player then reacts to, through a\xa0<em>dialogue between PC and world\xa0</em>in which the player acts and the world reacts. The core engine will be designed to direct it's interactions using a\xa0<em>codified set of principles,</em> through which it will drive the narrative towards a <em>sensible conclusion</em> based on the player's actions (regardless of what they are).<br/><br/>Now, some elaboration.\n<h4>PC/World Dialogue</h4>\nThe core of most interactive fiction is a dialogue between PC and world: the player does something, the world changes, the PC reacts to the change, etc., back and forth like a debate. Over time, the topic (spotlight) may change, and the speakers try to impose their views (goals) on the other.<br/><br/>Right now I'm thinking about simplifying this dialogue with a set of Moves, some available to the game and some available to the player. The player's moves are things like "Gain info" and "Escape Confinement", whereas the game's Moves are things like "Introduce threat" and "Remove obstacle".\n<h4>Set of Principles</h4>\nOne of my major sources of inspiration right now is Apocalypse World. In it, the "Master of Ceremonies" has a number of Principles to guide her decisions. What I have in my head of is a set of constraints and techniques for the engine to use. Stuff like "throw the player's most used moves back at them", "respond to stalling with new threats", and "Slowly escalate stakes".\n<h4>Sensible Conclusion</h4>\nObviously, all stories have to end. The two main goals for Engine in driving towards the climax (and conclusion of the main plotline) is for the conclusion to flow nicely from the preceding story and for it to make (some form of) logical sense. For the former we have to work in the concepts of theme and premise to some extent, and for the latter we have to define the underlying logic of the setting and make it work with some form of inference system.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>This post more-or-less reflects the more technical side of what I see this project as becoming. This is really only my initial observations, and is most likely going to change as I move forward with the project.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379006/#Comment_379006" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-20T12:50:44+00:00" title="May 20, 2012 12:50PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sort of framework is not uncommon in computer game design as a theoretical model; I've read similar stuff from designers as far back as the '80s. One might call this the structuralist approach to story-based computer game design. The difficulty in executing the vision in practice seems to mainly reside in practical game-making; most of the difficulty and work in creating a computer game ends up involving technical resources like art, music and content creation, and it seems that many initially ambitious projects along these lines have ended up with relatively modest execution when they've been finished at all. That is, the real problem is not in envisioning a dynamic game system that answers the player's actions, but rather in planning and executing a practical game project that can actually amass the necessary multimedia resources for displaying the game to the player. Consequently the most dynamic game systems that actually get made end up in indie productions that can make big compromises in technology, such as Rogue-like games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd" title="Jon_Shepherd"><img alt="Jon_Shepherd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/nFIK1HGFYHAN0.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd">Jon_Shepherd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379007/#Comment_379007" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-20T13:02:10+00:00" title="May 20, 2012  1:02PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've thought about this as well.

The engine will ask players to offer their description and interpretation of some plotlets and aspects, making it available to all players. This could even evolve in such a way that a player answers only to questions related to other players.

You may want to read Propp's book 'structure of russian fairy tales' or something like that.<br/><br/>Another approach is agent-based emergence: you put a number of actors in an arena and each one of them has a set of simple motivations, actions and stimuli, and you observe what happens when they interact.<br/><br/>Although structuralism is fascinating and it works well as a descriptive system, it is quite sterile as a generative system. It knows the shape of good things, but it can't produce them reliably.<br/><br/>Agent based  approach hits a wall once you realize that to make interesting stories you have to represent intentionality and plotting/introspection/meta-thinking within the agents.. and that's a mess to achieve.<br/><br/>I now believe that a possible way could be provided by a human/software cyborg engine, where software computes plots and combinations, and humans are used to provide the 2 parts that are missing in structuralism and agent-based emergence: choosing something that makes sense and provide intentionality.<br/><br/>I believe that something like Emily Boss' Caravan Wiki with some more structuralist approach to evolve the narrative would be a great step in the right direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emeraude" title="Emeraude"><img alt="Emeraude" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emeraude">Emeraude</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379016/#Comment_379016" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-20T14:45:45+00:00" title="May 20, 2012  2:45PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's at least one thesis paper with a software architecture based on Propp's work.<br/>Used to have it for my own bibliography, quick search seems to show other papers were published since.

Don't build the thing you're describing here; think of the simplest bit of it, or thing similar to it, that could possibly work, and build that. Build something that you can do in a weekend or a week, or however long you think you can maintain your focus and momentum. Then when you've built that, reflect on it and build the next thing, or add on to what you've built.<br/><br/>Just don't make the common mistake among creative people of describing castles in the sky that never get built, or of continually attempting something too big and giving up a fraction of the way through.<br/><br/>You might also want to look at the stuff <a href="http://www.failbettergames.com/" rel="nofollow">FailBetter Games</a> has done \u2014 online narrative games like "Echo Bazaar".

My design as of the moment involves "knowledge tokens", which track the game state by assigning properties and relationships to objects, as well as rules about which tokens can co-exist (thus defining the internal logic of the setting).<br/><br/>If I wanted to model romantic relationships in a game, maybe I'd start with a set of characters: John, Dave, Kate, and Mona. Then I'd add tokens to track their gender: statements like "John is-male". A few tokens to track the pairings at the start of the game would also be necessary, so I'd have things like "Mona dating Dave". When the engine proposes a change to the game-state, it creates a copy of the current game-state with the proposed changes and checks it against rules such as "X cannot be dating Y when X dating Z". The engine would also need support for implications: "If X dating Y, then Y dating X".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379180/#Comment_379180" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-21T16:42:03+00:00" title="May 21, 2012  4:42PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Others may disagree, but you may want to have a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog" rel="nofollow">prolog</a> for prototyping your ideas.

Basically these rules are great. But they do make it harder to teach. Check out Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess for a curriculum. It's what I used to teach kids chess for yeeears. Start with kings and rooks, then kings and queens, then kings and bishops and rooks, and so on.  Stuff like castling, en passant, and pawns, come later.<br/><br/>Pawns being able to move two spaces off their starting point is actually a relatively recent innovation.  It was done because chess was too fuckin' slow when pawns could only go one square at a time. Then when pawns became able to move two spaces, they put en passant in so that at least some vestige of earlier strategies could still work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
