                    (This can't be a book club, because I never finished the book.  So it's a 'book flail.')<br/>
<br/>
Last Spring, around the time everyone here was reading Johnstone's "Impro," I was reading McKee's "Story."  McKee is a Hollywood 'script doctor,' and was satirized (or possibly paid homage to) in the Charlie Kaufman film, "Adaptation."  "Story" is where he lays out his formula for writing successful middlebrow movies.  While McKee is mainly interested in cinema, and spends a lot of time complaining about bad movies, some of it bears on gaming, at least a little bit.<br/>
<br/>
First: McKee's pretty good on theme, or premise, or whatever the hell Narrativism is about.  According to McKee, thematic statements boil down to, "_______________ leads to ______________ ."  From what I can tell, in most Narrativist designs, the designer has filled in the first blank, and the second one is filled in through play.  So, here's <i>Sorcerer</i>: "A deal with the Devil leads to (results of play)."  And <i>Dogs</i>: "Playing God, even with the best intentions, leads to (results of play)."<br/>
<br/>
Second: characters aren't interesting because we know a lot of details about them.  They're interesting because they've got a lot of conflicting emotions and we can't predict which way they'll jump.  Case in point: characters with lots of juicy Keys in <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>.<br/>
<br/>
Third: In a given scene, something of value, changes.  You begin the scene as friends; you end the scene as enemies.  You begin the scene on your deathbed; you end the scene healthy.  This, so far as I know, doesn't have a counterpart in gaming: in a bunch of games, one set of stakes might be, "This thing doesn't change," and you end up with a pretty static scene if you win.  (Which I guess means the focus of the scene, when you're playing it out, should be on one of the things which <i>does</i> change.)<br/>
<br/>
Fourth: characters tend to be conservative in a crisis, taking the least risky path that will accomplish their objectives (limited by subjective evaluation).  Again, not necessarily hooked into gaming, but it's a nice way to think about, "What would the NPC do now?"<br/>
<br/>
I had some more notes somewhere, let me see if I can dig them out.                </div>

                            Hi James,<br/>
<br/>
On point three:<br/>
<br/>
Doesn't this happen though? I can't imagine getting through a conflict in <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> without something changing. I can imagine ramping up to a Humanity roll in <i>Sorcerer</i> without something changing.<br/>
<br/>
In Dogs, you either Give or Win. If you Win -- well, someting change. And even if you Give, the relationship between some characters has to be different (whether between PCs and PCs, PCs and NPCs, or NPCs and NPCs.)<br/>
<br/>
And in Sorcerer you really only make Humanity Checks and Gains rolls if some behavior is tested -- "Well, the character's gone <i>this</i> far now... For better or worse..."<br/>
<br/>
And with Primetime Adventures, it seems to me the Producer needs to call for the conflict when the Protagonist's Issue can be tested in such a way that there's a moment of crisis -- that is, something's going to change. Even if the character desire is to "stay the same," the only way there'd be a conflict is if, say, the Protagonist's wife demanded of the character, "Change!" If he doesn't, well, the Producer damned well better have the wife react in such a manner that there's a change in the relationship.<br/>
<br/>
So, my question is, there are no <i>tracking mechanics</i> or something for writing down on a piece of paper that something has changed? (Or chits, or whatever.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

                            Generally speaking, most games which use stakes are best served by defining those stakes as something changing either way.  In our recent <em>Sons of Liberty</em> game, at one point the Patriots were in jail.  The first suggestion for the next scene's stake were "get out of jail" but we realized failure would be pretty boring.  So we reconfigured stakes to "win, get out of jail with a valuable hostage; lose, get out of jail without a hostage."  The Patriots lost that scene, so they got out of jail -- without taking any friends along.                        </div>

                            Ah, right, I stand corrected.<br/>
<br/>
With that in mind, though, it's often easy to forget to set up stakes that way--or, to come up with changing stakes which don't drive the story along much.                        </div>

                            I'm glad someone else has made comment about McKee's 'Story' - for me, it opened my eyes to a lot of things which i think are applicable to roleplaying, and I think James_Nostak has done a great job of listing them.<br>
<br>
There is one thing I would add about a scene which is important, I think.  In a scene, there is either Action or a Revelation.  Which is to say, in a scene, something changes, but that change happens either through a revelation (Mother is trying to kill me!) or action (Brad leaves the house so his mother can't kill him).  That's all well and good for a movie, where you are not actively engaged in the character - but in an RPG, there obviously has to be something more.  So I would amend the rules and say that a scene has to have a revelation or an action, and a contest.  So it's either action and contest or revelation and contest.<br>
<br>
Combat is a classic contest - most games (Heroquest, I'm excepting you here) don't have good (or any) rules for other types of contests.  But for a scene has to have a contest for it to be satisfying for the player.  So - 'your mother is trying to kill you' is not a contest, but 'Roll spot Hidden' with the result that you find your mother's diary is a contest - and therefore a good scene (albeit a short one).  Or roll sanity, to ensure your mind doesn't crack with the revelation.  Some test of skill or chance, based on the characters abilities.<br>
<br>
Taking this back to a classic dungeon crawl, you enter the room and there is a contest - the fight or the trap or physical obstacle.  You overcome it and can now have the reward or the opportunity to move to the next contest (next chamber).<br>
<br>
I think this very simple idea is very powerful.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<p>This is a weakness in the way games are written, but I don't think it's often in the designers' intent. In Shock: you make something change; no one gets to have something not change. I mean, if I'm saying "I kill your family" you can't say "You don't kill my family." You both have to have proactive Intents.</p>
<p>In Dogs, it's pretty unlikely that you will win a conflict without fallout on either side, even if the Stakes are keeping things from changing.</p>
<p>It definitely happens; In PTA (at least the first edition) this wasn't addressed, but we determined pretty early on that Stakes have to be about changing something, not keeping it from changing.</p>
