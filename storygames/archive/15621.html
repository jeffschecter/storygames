I've found that the use of a GM, or not, is one of the most defining elements of any role-playing method. <br/><br/><b>CLASSICAL</b><br/>The presence of a game master is important to how the game plays, and feels, whatever kind of authority that game master is given by the method at hand. Turning one player into an agent for the setting, the theme, the conflict, the narrative ... is a way of doing role-playing games that comes with its own special possibilities.<br/><br/><b>MODERN</b><br/>Designing methods to steer a level field of players, or methods to make the players steer themselves, is a different kind of challenge, with its own special possibilities. <br/><br/><b>THIS DISCUSSION</b><br/>I'm fond of both these ways of designing and playing role-playing games, so I do not open this thread to discuss which is best. <br/><br/>I would like for us to think out loud on differences and similarities, from a designers perspective (others with ideas is welcome to post too). <br/><br/>And I would like us to think out loud on the special possibilities in each form.<br/><br/>Please give us your two cents!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/%5BDeleted%20User%5D" title="[Deleted User]"><img alt="[Deleted User]" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/%5BDeleted%20User%5D">[Deleted User]</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354138/#Comment_354138" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-13T03:57:18+00:00" title="January 13, 2012  3:57AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.<br/>\nAs far as I recall from many moons ago, games back then used to be rather heavy on the rules (especially Role Master), characters replaceable as they tended to die a lot, especially in the beginning of a campaign. Also, railroading was used often (and it's not always bad), or play could stall completely if you missed a single clue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese days, games tend to not need to have rules for doing simple things in the world, such as walking and chewing gum at the same time. They don't try to simulate reality the way older games did, but instead have rules suited to the theme of the game. Also, games tend to be shorter in duration and can last as little as an hour. This, of course, could happen in older games as well, but that was usually called a party-wipe.<br/>\nNewer games also assign the gm a different role than classics. The gm no longer has to know every rule by heart, because there simply aren't as many of those. The responsibility of the gm these days seems to be distributed to the players in a lot of cases, where the gm is still expected to play npc's and come up with the hook for the plot. However, once actual play starts, the gm can often be more of a director of scenes than author of the plotline, if you catch my meaning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354142/#Comment_354142" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-13T06:40:39+00:00" title="January 13, 2012  6:40AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did anyone else notice a bit of a shift in the ClassicGame style of GMing after Splatbooks became popular? It certainly felt that way to me.<br/><br/>Prior to that time, in the GMing tradition I began with, players often knew very little about the actual mechanics involved in a game and also rarely bought their own copies of games, unless they also intended to run the game in question in addition to participating as a character player.<br/><br/>The exception to this was generally some form of D&amp;D, as it was THE most commonly played game.<br/><br/>The end result, at least with regards to the traditions I learned from and absorbed, was that only the most very basic part of the rules was ever considered inviolate, with the rest being largely considered tools that the GM should be aware of, but ot necessarily beholden too. And frankly, even those core rules (generally very basic combat rules) <b>could</b> be changed, and often were if someone had produced a cool seeming variant in some magazine article that got the GM and/or players jazzed up.<br/><br/>With the popularity of Splatbooks ( coming into their heyday with VtM, but with some predecessors) character players were now getting more access to mechanics, and wanting to use them because, well, they made for awfully cool characters that they wanted to play, and wanted to insure those mechanics ( and the related core mechanics) were in fact used on a regular basis and not just with a go-ahead from the GM. GMs blocking the use of those mechanics (especially in favor of some sort of ad hoc ruling) seemed a bit of a betrayal.<br/><br/>Anyway, the upshot for me is that there are actually a couple of ways to look at approaching Classic game design. I'm personally more interested these days in that earlier style I learned with.<br/><br/>I'm also interested in what I've learned by looking at and playing what Tomas is calling more modern desin and pairing off the parts I find most useful from each.<br/><br/>In many cases, I find the useful parts of the modern style are mostly found in attitude towards contribution by all players, and the idea that the GM is mostly there to be a facilitator of fun. I also like the idea that core mechanics are ver simple, and the concept that players should have acce.ss to them and be able to call for their use. I'll go further and say that i also like the idea from more modern games that players can be trusted with the useof mechanics, be expected to know the basics of them, and are also expected to be facilitatrs of fun for the group as a whole, rather than just their own fun individually.<br/><br/>From Classic game style, I feel that the GM as the host of a MakeBelieve Verbal Costume Party is a pretty damn good one, and one worth re-exploring. I really do think there's something terribly good about a style where the GM comes up with a core concept, some color, some feel, and emphasizes and watches over it during play. Ithink that some more exploration of how far a GM should go in doing that would be worthwhile, as would ideas about how to communicate that to the group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_354435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354435/#Comment_354435" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-16T02:24:47+00:00" title="January 16, 2012  2:24AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2012 2:34AM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tore Vange</cite>Newer games also assign the gm a different role than classics.</blockquote>Having a GM is what makes a game "classic" in my terms. Older and newer classical rpgs naturally differ; there are developments going on all the time. I've never ever seen two classical games supporting the same role for the GM, unless one of the games lend method from the other.<br/><br/>There are a lot of ways of being a GM in role-playing games, as you said.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Anyway, the upshot for me is that there are actually a couple of ways to look at approaching Classic game design.</blockquote>A couple? I believe there are as many approaches to classical design as there are designers. And a lot of major trends to it too, that some of these designers fit into, more or less. <br/><br/>The same is true for modern design; the approaches are manifold and the results are equally diverse. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>In many cases, I find the useful parts of the modern style are mostly found in attitude towards contribution by all players, and the idea that the GM is mostly there to be a facilitator of fun.</blockquote>By "modern role-playing games" I talk about games with no GM.<br/><br/>As for newer games of the classical type (with GM), it is certainly interesting to study how they make methods that leaves the GM with other tools and other possibilities, and how some methods establish a more open and dynamic relationship between GM and players.<br/><br/>There is much inspiration to be had by watching (playing) the rainbow of <i>flowers</i> (games) springing out of the fertile ground of international rpg-design. We are in a second spring for role-playing games. I believe it started back in 2004, approximately. This is the spring where the flowers of last spring (1969-1980) have spread their seeds, as ideas take root and grow into <i>flowers</i> of new shapes and colors; a whole new set of games, and game methods, and experimental approaches to design both classical and modern.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354450/#Comment_354450" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-16T07:33:10+00:00" title="January 16, 2012  7:33AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a decent division, but why call them "classical" and "modern", why not just say "GMed" and "GMless"?
