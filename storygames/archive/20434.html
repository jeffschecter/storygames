I quickly printed out Lady Blackbird and we sat down to try it out. I had never run a game before and let everyone know to have patience if there was something we needed to figure out together.<br/><br/>Kale produced a lockpicking tool from his boot to open the door, and then Naomi neutralized the guards. Kale quickly searched them and redistributed their weapons among the group. They did not disguise themselves, electing to just try to get to the Owl as fast as they could. Cyrus used his memories from time with the empire to find the fastest route to the ship. They were spotted by a marine who the group took down, but not before he sounded the alarm. <br/><br/>The Owl was in sight but marines were hot in pursuit. Cyrus commanded Kale, Snargle, and Lady Blackbird to run for the ship while he and Naomi fought the stream of marines attempting to come through the passageway. They successfully kept enough at bay for the others to board the Owl, but soldiers began to surround them. Naomi started to attack the soldiers in hopes of making a hole to run for the ship, but Cyrus grabbed her hand and teleported them onto the Owl. Snargle lifted off and successfully evaded the interceptors in a masterful show of piloting skill. He then put the ship at full throttle to put some sky between them and the Hand of Sorrow. <br/><br/>Once the Owl was far enough away to start catching their breath, they saw that the evasive maneuvers had drained the fuel they needed to make it all the way to Haven. The winds were blowing away from Haven at the moment, so if they ran out completely they would slowly drift back towards Ilysium and the Hand of Sorrow. Lady Blackbird conjured up a change in the winds to give them enough of a boost to make it to Haven. They began making their way as a tracking device was found in the engine room. The crew decided to try to pass the device on to another ship in the port at Haven. <br/><br/>As Snargle brought the Owl down into the harbor, Kale went up top to try to toss the device onto a goblin scavenger ship. The roll failed, so he used his secret of reflexes to make another attempt that also failed. Kale attracted the attention of the goblin crew, who cornered the Owl to confront them about what exactly was going on. Cyrus said up front that it was a tracking device from an imperial ship, and the goblin captain was intrigued at the possibility of luring an imperial ship into a trap. The goblin captain was willing to take the device off their hands but was still upset at the subterfuge attempted. Earlier in the game, Snargle had made it clear that jelly beans were very important to goblins, so Cyrus gave away Snargle's prized green jelly beans as a peace offering.<br/><br/>Finally able to dock, Snargle wanted to go out in search of replacement jelly beans, but Cyrus ordered him to stay on board and make some repairs. Kale and Snargle began yelling at Lady Blackbird about not trusting who she was, prompting Naomi to get in their faces until they backed down. Naomi and Lady Blackbird had a conversation about how Lady Blackbird felt misunderstood by most non-nobles. Snargle pulled out a Flute of Many Winds (paper towel roll) and regaled the crew with an improbably hilarious ballad about the destruction of his home world by the sky squid. Cyrus went to go make fuel purchase arrangements as Kale went to the scrapyard in search of a few parts.<br/><br/>As Cyrus approached the fueling station, he immediately recognized the clerk as an ex-slave he had once recaptured as an Imperial soldier. The choice was between convincing this clerk to sell him fuel, or heading for the more upscale harbor where fuel was more expensive. Cyrus took the chance on making amends with the ex-slave. The fuel stationmaster was furious and showed Cyrus the ear that was cut off after he was returned. Cyrus made apologies and finally secured the fuel purchase after sharing that he shot the marine that was cruelest to the clerk when he defected from the force.<br/><br/>Over by the scrapyard, Kale saw a a trio of naive-looking sailors chatting outside a pub that looked like easy marks. He wanted to pickpocket all three, so he rolled to see how many he would be able to successfully steal from. The dice rolling highlight of the night was when on the last die, Kale rolled the success needed to pilfer from all three, securing a few jelly beans for Snargle from the goblin. <br/><br/>With Snargle not knowing about Kale's jelly bean acquisition, he took the chance to sneak off ship and try to find some on his own while shapeshifting. The market stall he happened by was staffed by a dead ringer for Lady Blackbird, who he then convinced to come back to the ship. Any anger at Snargle's sneaking around was gone once the resemblance between Lady Blackbird and Wester was seen. The woman shared the last name Syri, but had grown up on Olympia. The crew elected to try to have Wester join them, and Lady Blackbird was the one to make the overtures so that they could learn what might be the story behind their undeniable resemblance. The attempt was successful, and the play session ended with Wester Syri joining the crew of the Owl for their adventures. <br/><br/>For a group playing a story game for the first time I think it was extremely successful! The players behind Naomi and Lady Blackbird were quieter, but everyone was laughing and having a good time. I tried to involve them in things and get their input, and will work harder at this next time. Some highlights were the successful roll for Kale's pickpocketing, Snargle's paper towel roll flute serenade, and the sense of group accomplishment once the Hand of Sorrow had been escaped.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449555/#Comment_449555" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-17T19:07:22+00:00" title="November 17, 2015  7:07PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool!
