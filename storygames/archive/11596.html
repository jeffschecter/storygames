There is never going to be an Arcane Power 2 or a Shadow Power or a Darksun Player's Guide or any of that. The DMG 3 will not happen.<br/><br/>Starting in Fall of 2010, they will produce a new line of D&amp;D called "D&amp;D Essentials" which will come in a Red Box. It will have vastly simplified rules when compared to 4e D&amp;D, because the entire Player's Guide fits into 32 pages including the Table of Contents. It will go from levels 1-5, and the closest equivalent is the D&amp;D Basic Rules. This strongly indicates that the new main edition of the game that will come out in 2011 will be contrasted as being "Advanced." Even money on whether the new edition gets called "Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons."<br/><br/>In the meantime, D&amp;D Essentials will be getting its own expansions, that will include a "Dungeon Master's Kit," a "Monster Vault," and at least two "Player's Essentials" books that will take the D&amp;D Essentials game past 5th level. These will probably have kludgy rules that allow you to use them with 4e D&amp;D standard, but the focus will be upon working directly with the simplified "D&amp;D Essentials" rules. </blockquote>\nOf course, this ties in to our own <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11443&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">recent discussions</a> of the new Red Box and <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11448" rel="nofollow">why the hell they might do that.</a><br/><br/>They seem to be trying to address the fact that <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10314" rel="nofollow">the game is far too complicated</a> for what they want to do with it.

My group has all of that stuff pretty much figured out, but that's after a substantial amount of planning an innovation on our part with power cards, initiative cards, battle mats, minis, little color-coded rubber bands for marks and other conditions, and so on. We'd have happily paid for a (reasonably priced) box of a bunch of that kind of stuff, but WotC never provided any such thing. (Though come to think of it, <a href="http://fierydragon.com/dragonsbreath/?p=245" rel="nofollow">Fiery Dragon's "Battle Box"</a> has a lot of that stuff.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258484/#Comment_258484" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T10:07:56+00:00" title="February 25, 2010 10:07AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2010 10:11AM by Wordman.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems like the idea behind all of this is really market penetration.

If it doesn't address the problem, 4e may well suffer for it. Frank mistakes the latter possibility for the inevitable outcome, alas.<br/><br/>There are two factual errors in the second paragraph, by the by. First, the Red Box won't go to level 5.

It's the sme game repackaged to introduce new players to D&amp;D.  One the new players get used to D&amp;D via the Essentials books, they'll be funneled back to the existing core rules and such.  The developers have already gone back to writing the 4e supplements that will be released after the Essentials line is done, as the Essentials stuff was a limited set of products (new Red Box, Essentials and one or two more things).<br/><br/>Either dude is underinformed and doesn't understand the goal of the new products, or he's saying that WotC is lying to us.  WotC lying isn't unprecedented, but it does put the post firmly in conspiracy theory territory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258556/#Comment_258556" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T15:24:26+00:00" title="February 25, 2010  3:24PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it seems like random doomsaying speculation.

What a large part of the roleplaying audience doesnt' seem to understand is that there is a huge part of the population that are intimidated by large, thick books. By coming up with a simpler version of the game, they have a greater chance of bringing in new players that might move up to the more complex game.</blockquote>\nWhile I don't disagree with you and wouldn't dispute this without solid facts and figures to back it up, I do wonder how much crossover there is between the demographic that are intimidated by large, thick books and the people who would consider playing any kind of RPG, simple or otherwise. It's all a bit of a moot point without accurate statistics though.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259133/#Comment_259133" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-28T16:19:06+00:00" title="February 28, 2010  4:19PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seeing that I don't have the resources to launch a survey to back up my statement, I will need to rely on my instincts and observation of human behavior.
