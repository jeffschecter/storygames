A single cool die? Or is it figurative?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I'm not trying over-think this very simple system but it bugs me a bit that a character can never lose trait dice other than via a stress roll and those seem completely detached from any sort of physical issue. In other words, if a character decides to run through traffic and utterly botches their Athletics roll, they might suffer from some "hilarious" effect but there is no direct effect applied to any of their attributes (unless, I suppose, a GM were to ask for a stress roll after the impact).<br/>\n<br/>\nAre people linking botched skills rolls with stress rolls or some other connective method or are people just waving that stuff off?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235252/#Comment_235252" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T12:14:28+00:00" title="October  2, 2009 12:14PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.<br/><br/>When I GM Inspectres I basically deal out stress everytime I have to introduce content.  There are exactly two conditions under which this occurs.<br/><br/>1) There is a lull in the action and I have to have something happen that the InSpectres have to react to.  I always pick something Stress inducing.<br/>2) The result of a failed roll.  The consequences nearly always cause Stress.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235299/#Comment_235299" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T16:53:52+00:00" title="October  2, 2009  4:53PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, losing your cool = losing all your cool dice, as well as a number of skill dice = stress dice you rolled. <br/><br/>In general, if someone totally blows a roll, I will give them stress as a direct consequence:<br/><br/>You blew your Athletics roll to run through traffic? well, all those cars you bounce off of, that hurts! Three stress!<br/><br/>You blew your Contact roll to talk your way through the museum security guard? He radios to someone, referring to "the smelly wierdo with the pipe wrench" and giving you the "you're crazy" look. One Stress!<br/><br/>This is an important and vital job as an InSpectres GM!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
