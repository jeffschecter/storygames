The stuff that's carrying the most weight in emulating the genre is my story-structure/plot subsystem (for example, it's a single-protagonist story rather than a multi-protagonist character drama), but I also do some other things to evoke the right mindset for the source material (for example, play is broken up into "chapters" and the action revolves around a single "viewpoint character" in each chapter so that things feel more like a novel than a movie or TV show) and the mechanics have elements that encourage genre-appropriate stuff (for example, there will often be adversity from "the environment" since not everything in Epic Fantasy is a conflict with another character, you'll frequently encounter situations like the Fellowship's attempt to cross the snowy pass at Caradhras).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402671/#Comment_402671" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-04T08:38:28+00:00" title="January  4, 2013  8:38AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Both <a href="http://www.omnihedron.co.uk/dutyandhonour/" rel="nofollow">Empire</a> games (Duty and Honour and Beat to Quarters) are really good at emulating Napoleonic military fiction and Napoleonic naval fiction respectively (so, Sharpe and Hornblower, basically). Character creation involves not only a clear location in the rigid social classes of the time, but also card drawing that fleshes out interesting spoils of war and histories for characters, and makes reputation an up-front-important part of the game, just as much as Skills and Traits (you can risk your reputation on important conflicts). Conflict / task resolution also uses a neat skirmish mechanic which feels like the "everyone together, doing different stuff to help" really well.

In order to take any action, you must have a card in your hand that is a valid play (based on what you were led, and some other simple stuff).

Metally, physically and emotionally. They are pretty low at the beginning and lead to the characters losing and getting beat down at the beginning, but as they rise over the time of one session the characters get more sucessful. Emulating the hard luck protagonists of many noir stories and the way personalities change for better or worse.<br/>It also has the same rules for emotional, social and physical confrontations, which allows for much of the underhanded threatening and only hinting at violence that Hays Code influenced film noir had. It also allows player vs. player conflict without deadly consequences. Because the stats only shift when attacked you can even modify your character in a way you like by losing confrontations.<br/>Each character has a secret another player knows and those can be used as "weapons" in social combat. Making secrets something you want to protect but also use as leverage against other characters. Thus encouraging the tension and distrust between protagonists in many noir fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402688/#Comment_402688" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-04T10:47:20+00:00" title="January  4, 2013 10:47AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Paranoia</i> *invented* its genre, so I think it qualifies. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><i>James Bond Role Playing</i> nailed the movies, if not the novels.<br/><i>Toon</i> did well by one type of slapstick cartoon.<br/><br/>...

The mechanics create a dance between bonuses for daring pulp stunts and the "Danger Point" currency to encourage over-the-top actions and derring-do, as well as cheesy dialogue.  The resolution is abstract enough to create the Indiana Jones/Star Wars style slugfest without worrying about the gritty details of injury (though you could surely narrate gory results, the game presumes a social contract that adheres to a clean depiction of events).<br/><br/><i>Ars Magica</i> pioneered a detailed magic simulator that combines Latin verbs and nouns to produce effects.  In tandem with individualized side effects, magical mutations, and a split between formulaic and spontaneous magic, the magi are powerful, unusual characters, but not superheroic.  The necessity for study and research over time creates its own subgame of long-term character construction.  The medieval world is emphasized in the interplay of magical and divine forces, the impact of character aging as the seasons pass, and in the way wounds and combat are a real threat.  The game doesn't have much of a metagame in terms of currency like Hero Points, so there's a little old school vibe in that you can't fudge die results.  In similar wise, magic is powerful but limited, and much less reliable when cast off the cuff.  It all adds up to a gritty package.  My experience has been that really powerful magic is earned over many years of in-game time, and that the differences between the long-lived magi and the mayfly grogs over long-term games adds a consistent thread of pathos to Ars stories.  If anything, it's the project management grind of deciding on seasonal research, study, and enchantment that informs the game with a lot of its sense of the long count.<br/><br/>It's certainly true that you can set the dials to make a more light-hearted game.  I've been in a number of wacky sessions, filled with oddball humor, but these don't subtract from the overall grit produced by <i>Ars Magica's</i> system and setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402698/#Comment_402698" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-04T12:33:45+00:00" title="January  4, 2013 12:33PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="http://www.tao-games.com/?p=36" rel="nofollow">Hot Guys Making Out.</a></blockquote>\nOh yeah, it's amazing.

In tandem with individualized side effects, magical mutations, and a split between formulaic and spontaneous magic, the magi are powerful, unusual characters, but not superheroic.  The necessity for study and research over time creates its own subgame of long-term character construction.  The medieval world is emphasized in the interplay of magical and divine forces, the impact of character aging as the seasons pass, and in the way wounds and combat are a real threat.  The game doesn't have much of a metagame in terms of currency like Hero Points, so there's a little old school vibe in that you can't fudge die results.  In similar wise, magic is powerful but limited, and much less reliable when cast off the cuff.  It all adds up to a gritty package.  My experience has been that really powerful magic is earned over many years of in-game time, and that the differences between the long-lived magi and the mayfly grogs over long-term games adds a consistent thread of pathos to Ars stories.  If anything, it's the project management grind of deciding on seasonal research, study, and enchantment that informs the game with a lot of its sense of the long count.</blockquote>\nOk, but what genre is this? What movie or book or series can you emulate with Ars Magica?\n<blockquote>3:16 is great at emulating Starship Troopers and it can be tweaked a bit to emulate any soldiers-in-a-battefield situation pretty well. Uses only two skills: combat and non-combat, which are more than enough. You either have a functional armor or a destroyed one, which is quite believable if heavy weaponry and lethal aliens are involved. And it's got flashbacks to take care of in-game character background building, instead of making each player write a background nobody is gonna read. I even made a <a href="http://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2012/06/05/mission-generator-for-316/" rel="nofollow">mission generator</a> that helps a lot for instant prep.</blockquote>\nThe book or the film? I don't think 3:16 ever even attempted to emulate the film beyond the "fascist alien-killing army" theme. There are no officer assassinations, flashbacks to past or psychopathic, maladjusted grunts in Starship Troopers, and the film has elements that aren't explored at all in the game. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402727/#Comment_402727" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-04T23:43:45+00:00" title="January  4, 2013 11:43PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I view "hard fantasy" as a genre, but that may be an affectation on my part.

You can literally use the terminology of cinema to add details to your dice pool. On top of that, the rule of narative truth means that what the player says happens, this can make every player a 'goddamn action hero'. <br/><br/>If you consider 'action movie' a genre, I would so use Wushu for The Princess Bride, the Matrix, any John Woo gun ballet, or swashbuckling adventure.  If the players like beating themselves up, the system works for cinematic survival/horror too. <br/>--<br/>TAZ<br/><br/>By the way, that also makes Wushu an excellent RPG for play-by-post gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402776/#Comment_402776" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-05T20:38:22+00:00" title="January  5, 2013  8:38PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pendragon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
