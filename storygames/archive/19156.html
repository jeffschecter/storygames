It was actually my first time playing Kingdom ever, and in fact I only learned the rules yesterday, so it was a good opportunity for me to give the rules a spin, too.<br/><br/><b>Setting up the Kingdom</b><br/><br/>Since I'd read about Crazy Horse recently (The Journey of Crazy Horse by Joseph M. Marshall III, a damned good book especially on audio), and because I wanted to provide a reasonable default in case no one had any ideas, the kingdom seed I used for the promotional materials was a vaguely Lakota-inspired community. Of course we still had the option to play something else, and bandied about a couple of other ideas including a Westeros-like fantasy kingdom and a cyberpunk megacorporation. These were rejected for various reasons (I was bored with Western fantasy, and the idea of a corporate roleplay was intimidating to me and another player) and we went with the Plains tribe.<br/><br/><b>First Crossroad: Miners at the Holy Mountain</b><br/><br/>Our tribal kingdom turned out a lot happier than history led us to expect, that's for sure, and I was rather happy with that. Our first Crossroad was whether to drive out white miners from our holy mountain. My medicine man Grasps the Wide Sky, a Perspective character, warned that doing so would bring white soldiers on us. My character's wife, White Mole, was a two-spirited man and a Touchstone who insisted we should flee rather than confront the whites. Our son Low Wind, a leading hunter in the tribe and originally a Power, wanted the miners out but was willing to start with non-violent means. The tribe's trader and Touchstone, Hundred Eyes, went on a mission from Low Wind to the whites to convince them to leave--but only got insults in return. Low Wind and the young people started agitating for violent action, which the elders like Graps the Wide Sky and White Mole were strenuously against.<br/><br/>From there, interestingly enough, our Crisis started to escalate far more quickly than our Crossroad as the focus of the conflict moved on to intra-tribe conflict, specifically between the elders who were against confrontation and the young ones who wanted it. Partly this was because White Mole was an inveterate coward, and therefore the people with him, and kept checking Crisis. The other Touchstone, Hundred Eyes, didn't uncheck Crisis all that often, since it was clear things were escalating.<br/><br/><b>Crisis: Generational Conflict!</b><br/><br/>We ended up resolving Crisis before our first Crossroad. Three of the characters calmed the people's fears by giving speeches and giving out gifts while White Mole successfully fled. Except White Mole, who automatically voted thumbs-down due to the escape, we voted to keep the kingdom going and went on to play, as agreed before the resolution. White Mole, while fleeing East, was gunned down by a missionary's party as a pervert. Hey, even in this day and age people don't always receive the sight of a huge old guy in woman's clothing with perfect equanimity. <br/><br/><b>First Crossroad Resumes</b><br/><br/>The player came back with a very different character, Barks Like a Dog (which in Korean basically means BS), a man who was once a scout for the whites and fled back to the Tribe after becoming a wanted man for some crime. This speaks-white and criminal became the turning point for the tribe's fortunes, ironically enough. As a Power he started pushing violent action against the miners with the passion of a man who loves violence. Low Wind, as a Power, had decreed that if the tribe drove the miners out they would do so in alliance with neighboring tribes. Barks Like a Dog added that they would leave no witnesses. Then Low Wind, who since became a Perspective, said the tribe would prosper eternally if they drove the miners out. Wide Sky's prediction that this would bring down the soldiers was successfully challenged, since he was now a Touchstone and not a Perspective. Wide Sky's brief stint as a Power had ended with his own son overthrowing him and holding him under tent arrest.<br/><br/>Since the weight of the game had fallen so heavily to driving the miners out, this pretty unsurpsingly became our conclusion when resolving the Crossroad. Elders like Wide Sky were timid about opposing the decision after the tribe had almost torn itself apart over the issue. Our warriors, together with warriors from allied tribes, wiped out the miners, and waylaid the soldiers who marched from the nearby garrison to another victory. The tribe became part of a powerful federation of tribes, though this alliance also led to problems down the line.<br/><br/><b>Second Crossroad: Tribute to the Turtles</b><br/><br/>Our second Crossroad was whether to pay tribute to a tribe, the Turtles, who insisted that our hunting lands were originally theirs and that we should give them a portion of our kill. Wide Sky, once again a Perspective, was a voice for peace, predicting that not paying tribute would weaken the alliance, but this was challenged and deleted. To further defeat the pro-tribute side Hundred Eyes, now a Power having spent his fortune in gifts for influence, decreed that he would send out missions to the other tribes asking them not to intervene in the event of non-payment, thus preventing the quarrel from weakening the alliance as a whole. Hundred Eyes also ordered that, if the tribe didn't pay, they would force a sacred oath on the Turtles not to seek tribute from another tribe again. Low Wind, a Perspective, predicted that the tribe would suffer from hunger if they paid tribute.<br/><br/>At the resolution the tribe refused to pay tribute and Hundred Eyes' orders were carried out, including the Turtles' oath and the other tribes' non-interference. We had decided this Crossroad would be the end of our game, so the player who would have written the next Crossroad (Low Wind's player) narrated how this was the start of the great Native Federation that spread its influence from coast to coast, linking with tribes in the east and trading with China in the west. <br/><br/><i>(Update: Husband reminded me of the characters' endings)</i> We also had individual endings for our characters. Barks Like a Dog and his ne'er-do-well friends started calling themselves the Sons of Dogs and became enforcers in the tribe. Low Wind's Hope that the tribe would be assertive with the whites had come true. He was revered as a holy man and retired in the holy mountain he had fought for. Hundred Eyes' Hope that the tribe would prosper from accepting the whites' technological and material advances also came increasingly true, though his push for greater openness and exchange was highly controversial. Wide Sky's Hope that the tribe's spiritual values would be influential became a reality when a white writer visited to write a book about the tribe, though the old man didn't see a cent from his contribution because he didn't know he was supposed to get any. He was still plenty happy.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427422/#Comment_427422" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-19T08:04:20+00:00" title="January 19, 2014  8:04AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2014 8:28AM by Eldir.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Impressions: Rules, Players, and Setting</b><br/><br/>We had a lot of fun with this game, and enjoyed the way the fluid changes in the Roles led to dynamism in the story. Like the way Wide Sky's predictions became overrun when he vacated his Perspective role, for instance. It's definitely not easy being the minory opinion in the kingdom but I still loved every moment, lol.<br/><br/>Originally I was a little bit worried about how the tribal roleplaying would turn out, whether it would descend into a stereotype-fest a la every Hollywood movie with Indians or faux Indians ever. (Please tell me if there are exceptions.) I don't think that happened, and I attribute that partly to the players and partly to the rules. All the players were well-read and had varying degrees of interest in indigenous American histories. The rules reinforced that by encouraging players to create very concrete characters and by putting them in conflict with each other. It's hard to tell flat and uninteresting stories when there is such lively exchange between characters. <br/><br/>I loved our deeply flawed yet sympathetic characters. My Wide Sky came across as a placating fool but was also genuinely a man of peace. White Mole was an unabashed coward but had good reason, since he was a caregiver for the children of the tribe and feared for them. Of course when push came to shove he fled alone, showing his cowardice was greater than his devotion.<br/><br/> Barks Like a Dog was a violent criminal catapulted to heroism due to the needs of the moment. After the first Crossroad was resolved we joked that the whites should just come and collect on his bounty, and I'm pretty sure our characters shared the sentiment. Hundred Eyes was a materialistic opportunist who nevertheless had the determination to spend his wealth for power and used that power well once he got it.<br/><br/>Low Wind probably came closest to fitting the idea of a noble savage, but there were tantalizing hints of a fuller life with his conflicts with his father and possibly his mother. It was stated at one point that Low Wind kept calling White Mole his father, hinting at conflict with his mother's gender identity. (We think Low Wind was an orphaned relative of one of the couple.)<br/><br/>In one sense, though, the setting was somewhat limiting. This may partly be stereotyping on our part, but we simply didn't have the kind of bloody backstabbing that such political infighting would suggest in a more centralized society. We didn't have a jail to throw dissidents in--the closest we got was Low Wind confining Wide Sky to his tent with warriors standing guard outside, and even this stretched credibility in a society where dissenting members could just move away. Since the dissenters were mostly elderly, of course, their chances of surviving and thriving without warriors and hunters was in question and may have been a practical restraint.<br/><br/>With our next game, though, the cyberpunk megacorp idea that was originally jinxed, we took the gloves off and went after each othe like Machiavelli on steroids. The general consensus was that this second game was easier and more fun, though I found the tribal game more thought-provoking. Since it's past midnight here I'll write about the high points of that game tomorrow, if anyone's interested.<br/><br/><b>Questions: Ending Narration and Character-Related Predictions and Orders</b><br/><br/>After play we had four rules questions, and may have more down the line. First, is it legal for a player to state the overall ending for a game? We got this idea from the "What Happens Now?" section on p. 66, which seemed to say that the player to the left of the one that created the just-resolved Crossroad got to narrate an overall ending. Reading it again, though, it seems to apply to situations where the game <i>didn't</i> end with the resolution of the first Crossroad. (English not first language, please forgive.) So is the ending narration I described above--a player narrating the great Native Federation and stuff--illegal? if the game ends with the resolution, is the change in Hopes/Fears the only ending you get?<br/><br/>The second question is: May a Perspective make a prediction that is about a specific position, rather than a character? For instance, "If the Kingdom tears down the temple the king will die of a curse." This is about a character (the king), but does not specify who it is.<br/><br/>Third question: May a Power give a Crossroads order to kill another player character? My best guess is that the attempt may be made if the order is carried out but success depends on the target's player, but I'd like to confirm whether this is right.<br/><br/>Fourth question: If a Perspective made predictions for a Crossroads but has no valid predictions in the selected column during resolution, is the character out of luck and obliged to pass the Perspective turn of the resolution without making further predictions or having any say, other than using an Interrupt to challenge, change roles etc.? I'm pretty sure the answer is "yes," but my husband insists that I check.<br/><br/>And now it is one in the morning and I really must go to bed. I'd love any ideas on the rules questions. There'll probably be a ton of typos since I don't have time to read it all over right now, sorry about that--I'll edit tomorrow at work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427494/#Comment_427494" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-21T02:16:49+00:00" title="January 21, 2014  2:16AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2014 2:17AM by Ben_Robbins.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eldir, that sounds like a really great game. No exaggeration. Personally I really enjoy games that strike a serious human chord and it sounds like your group nailed that. Well done!<br/><br/>In answer to your questions:<br/><br/>1) The "What Happens Now?" section is really just for wrapping up the outcome of a particular Crossroad. The "Ending the Game" section covers finishing the game as a whole.<br/><br/>If it doesn't feel like the Kingdom has come to a clear ending and we're ready to stop, I find it's often interesting to hear what Crossroad the next player would have made (like in your game "Do we unite other tribes under a federation?"). That gives us a nice sense of what future challenges our Kingdom would face. That player doesn't have any legal authority to narrate the outcome of that Crossroad without playing it, but just like it says in the "Ending the Game" section, players are free to discuss what they think the future would hold or what they would have wanted to have happen. But now you're not playing anymore, just sharing ideas and talking about your game. It isn't binding.<br/><br/>2) No. As soon as you start making predictions about characters (even if you aren't sure who is going to be sitting in that seat) Perspective becomes more about blackmailing other characters instead of talking about the Kingdom. It goes downhill fast. There are certainly cases where I think "wow, a prediction about that person would make total sense!" but it's a very slippery slope, which is why the rules forbid it.<br/><br/>3) You can definitely take actions to try and kill another player's character, whether you're Power ordering your troops or just a random character with a knife. But just as described in "Death &amp; Dying", they don't die unless their player wants them too.<br/><br/>But the best approach is always to have your characters act like they have *no idea* that's a rule. If your character wants to kill someone, describe the attempt, even though as a player you know it's going fail. Murder attempts and knives in the dark go with the territory. That's good drama.<br/><br/>4) Yes, that's correct. You only get a "hindsight" prediction if you never made one for this Crossroad. It may seem like your predictions on the other side of the Crossroad had no effect because that side wasn't chosen, but in reality those consequences influenced the decision that was made. Some of the most powerful predictions never come true, because people work hard to avoid them.<br/><br/>Now I really want to hear about your Megacorp game\u2026<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427517/#Comment_427517" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-21T15:38:25+00:00" title="January 21, 2014  3:38PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yay you replied!

It changes Perspective from understanding the Kingdom to suddenly getting to threaten everyone's personal lives. It's just too tempting.<br/><br/>There certainly could be good predictions about individuals, but it's a very slippery slope, which is why the rule errs on the side of safety. The better option is to talk about groups or sections of the community. "If we go to war, the students will protest" doesn't commit any individual character to action. It focuses on a consequence for the Kingdom.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427661/#Comment_427661" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-26T05:47:22+00:00" title="January 26, 2014  5:47AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it is a scary title now that I think about it. Sounds like a bad remake of James Cameron's <i>Avatar.</i> (Not that <i>Avatar</i> isn't already bad, but that's another subject.)<br/><br/>I see your point about the slippery slope, and will enforce it in future games.<br/><br/>Now onto the megacorp game! Sorry for the lateness, I had it stored away for most of the week almost but not quite ready to go.<br/><br/><b>The Sleep of Antitrust Breeds... GAS?</b><br/><br/>It turned out we had room for more than one game in our afternoon. Predicting game times was pretty much a moot point anyway, since ending a game hinges on player agreement. Since it was only four in the afternoon when we ended the tribal game, we decided to bring back one of our discarded setting ideas from earlier. We were evenly split on the cyberpunk megacorporation and another idea I can't remember right now. We actually decided by rock-paper-scissors, since we now had the confidence that we could have fun with just about any setting. Megacorporation it was.<br/><br/>It didn't turn out to be a recognizably "cyberpunk" game, after all, other than futuristic elements like a "Hypernet" virtual-reality conference room and a hotel in orbit. It became mostly a game of corporate intrigue and backstabbery against a background that took current developments to deliberately ridiculous extremes. Except it didn't seem that ridiculous in the end, strangely enough.<br/><br/>Dramatis personae: First, the corporation itself. In keeping with the ridiculous extremes concept, I proposed a merger of three of the hottest companies in our time. One has a corporate name that comes from ten multiplied by a power of 100, the second is a delicious fruit, and the third... well in the original language it means "three stars." Let's just say that it's the company that's sold the most smartphones in the world for the last couple of years. This new super-duper-ultra-mega-corporation's acronym was GAS. Its locations included its headquarters in neo-Seoul, the aforementioned orbital hotel, and a grungy mega-industrial complex that housed its factories.<br/><br/>Second, the player characters. James Gold was the manager of the GAS Hotel in outer space, whose hope was that the hotel division would take over the Hyatt Hotel. (Would that make it GASH?) Andre Tojo was the cross-dressing head of the entertainment division who feared that his entertainment division would be exposed as the prostitution operation it actually was. Keumja Lee worked at one of the GAS mega-industrial complex factories and was a leader of their secret union, since unions were <i>verboten</i> in this hyper-futuristic corporation. (This is currently true of the S part of GAS.) She also moonlighted as Ashlee, one of Andre's girls, to spy on the GAS leadership. She hoped that GAS would be forced to allow her union to act openly. Finally, Jobs Kim was the head of R&amp;D and also of GAS PMC (private military company). He hoped that the PMC could take over Korea's entire security operations.<br/><br/><b>Crossroad: Android Trouble</b><br/><br/>Our first (and, as it turned out, last) crossroad was whether GAS would develop androids to replace its rebellious workforce and also as soldiers for the PMC. Jobs was the one who pushed for this policy the hardest, since the factory unions were becoming a problem for his security operation and he was also hoping to cut the PMC's costs. James was highly against the idea because he wanted GAS to devote its resources to the Hyatt acquisition. Andre was immediately for the idea because he wanted an android replica of Jobs, whom he'd had a crush on for years. Ashlee pouted that androids could replace her and the other girls, while secretly panicking that her union could be in jeopardy.<br/><br/>Some high points: <br/><br/>- Keumja/Ashlee riled up the workers against the android plan, increasing Crisis, but was countered by Andre, another Touchstone, who unchecked Crisis by putting his entertainment machine in full swing.<br/>- Jobs wrote projections about how much the company's productivity would suffer unless it developed the androids.<br/>- James, as a Power, promised that he would hand PMC a major contract if Jobs just dropped the android plan.<br/>- Andre, having become a Power and desperate for his Jobs android, ordered that the union would be allowed once the androids were developed. Ashlee promptly started unchecking Crisis.<br/>- Andre then Overthrew James, canceling James' deal with Jobs and promising James' place on the board of directors to Ashlee. She changed her role to become a Power, which cost her her union's trust.<br/>- James, now a Perspective, started writing up a storm of reports poisoning the android well, predicting all sorts of dire consequences if the android development plan went into effect.<br/>- Ashlee in her new role as Power ordered that, if the androids were developed, they would only be used for sex work and not factory labor or security. This was subsequently overturned when she was Overthrown.<br/><br/><b>Resolution and Ending</b><br/><br/>Since it was time for dinner by the time we had checked all the Crossroad boxes, we decided to end the game once the Crossroad was resolved. Some of the predictions were illegal in retrospect, such as Andre's that the company president would die of, um, pleasure if the androids were developed.<br/><br/>The Resolution was delayed once when Ashlee and James, the two Powers, went into a stalemate. We drew two more boxes and when the second Resolution came around, Ashlee and either Andre or Jobs were the two Powers. I hesitated have Ashlee vote Yes, since my earlier order that androids would only be used for sex work had been canceled, but went with Yes in the end because the hour was too late for yet another stalemate. Besides, the union would be allowed to operate, though in a watered-down form due to a subsequent order.<br/><br/>With the development of the androids various orders and predictions came into effect, including James' order that the entertainment division would be merged with the hotel division if androids were developed. The union came out of the underground but was little more than a puppet, and Jobs' PMC didn't end up benefiting much because the anti-android characters had tried so hard to swing his incentive the other way. One of the orders was that Andre's office would end up being a bathroom, but he was happy enough with his Jobs-droid.<br/><br/><b>Time Passes: 30 Years Later</b><br/><br/>We ended up checking the last Time Passes box after resolving the Crossroad, so we decided to narrate our characters' fates over the next 30 years.<br/><br/>Andre: Lived a long and happy life with his droid in his super-luxurious and spacious bathroom-office with its own cognac fountain.<br/><br/>Jobs: Had a long and successful career as the second-in-power at GAS, but was ultimately betrayed and met a nasty end.<br/><br/>James: Pushed out of the company in disgrace, he rehabilitated his image with a self-serving memoir and took to the lecture circuit.<br/><br/>Ashlee: Embittered by her experience at GAS, she grew increasingly radicalized before she was killed in a shootout with police.<br/><br/><b>Impressions</b><br/><br/>This game was much more cutthroat and no-holds-barred compared to the tribal game, and we had a lot of fun with it. I liked how the Kingdom rules could be used to emulate shady deals and naked politicking, and was really tickled by how the mechanics dovetailed with corporate mainstays like future projections reports.<br/><br/>One comment that the players had was that character information like relationships and especially weaknesses were very easily forgotten, as they seemed more roleplaying guidelines than part of the rules. Hopes and Fears were extensively utilized, and so were relationships to an extent (though not that much in the megacorporation game), but everyone seemed to forget their weakness once the game was in swing. I think it might have been fun to give players ways to invoke each others' weaknesses, or maybe rewards for invoking one's own weakness. That might just be my experience with Fate speaking, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427753/#Comment_427753" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-29T04:58:03+00:00" title="January 29, 2014  4:58AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You combined Google, Apple and Samsung and androids ran amuck? Is that poetic justice or subtle commentary? Either way, pretty great.<br/><br/>It sounds like after your sensitive and serious tribal game you cut loose with some backstabbing! That's one of the nice things about Kingdom: it works fine with a variety of tones. You can make a game that's super-serious, or melodramatic, or all the way to whacky hijinks.<br/><br/>As far as Issues go, they really are primarily a role-playing prompt, just as you describe. They are there to get you thinking about the characters as people. If you look at almost all the setup details they work the same way. For example, Threats don't actually do anything mechanical, but they serve the essential purpose of getting the players on the same page about problems that the Kingdom faces. It doesn't seem that discussion does much, but then you look back and see that the whole game was shaped by the things you all agreed upon in those first twenty minutes.<br/><br/>Just like with playing up people's Wishes/Fears, you do others players a huge favor when you bring their Issues into play. You're shining a big spotlight on the things that player said they were interested in seeing in the game.<br/><br/>Also: wrapping up with Time Passes? Very classy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427857/#Comment_427857" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-31T20:31:14+00:00" title="January 31, 2014  8:31PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yup, those were the three. Like I said we took everything to purposefully ridiculous extremes, lol.<br/><br/>The variety of tone is what I like about Kingdom, too. It's not like Fiasco or Polaris (both of which I love) in that the tone is not a part of the game.<br/><br/>I get your point that the issues give depth to the characters. I guess without issues and the other flesh-out details the characters would be pretty damned flat. Maybe it's a legacy of more traditional roleplaying games that I expect game stats to reside in the characters. Also I like that it's a way to structure discussion, making it part of the atmosphere rather than dictating that it be incorporated into the game. Pretty sneaky design! :P<br/><br/>The other players engineered the timing of Time Passes. We were almost done with both our Crossroad card and Time Passes cards when a player was about to check Time Passes. The other players reminded him that resolving Crossroad would also fill out the last Time Passes box so we could wrap up the game that way. I was pretty impressed with how quickly they'd caught on to and were manipulating the rules, but that's gamers for you.<br/><br/>We'll be playing the second Kingdom reception play next weekend with a group that includes someone who's never roleplayed before. She's also a political science student and was immediately interested when I pitched Kingdom as a political game, so the game ought to be interesting for more than one reason. Stay tuned for the play report!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
