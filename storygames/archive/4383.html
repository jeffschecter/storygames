I also ran a game of Dust Devils.  In preparation, I came up with a little scenario called 3 Days in Hell, which I ran once at the con and once two days prior as a practice run.  It worked quite well, and I told Matt I'd share my experiences.<br/><br/>First, the scenario.  The situation was pretty simple.  The characters are all in the town of Brownstone, Montana.  Just recently, a really bad man named James Cartwright was thrown into jail by the newly appointed sheriff, Zachary Hayes.  In 3 days, federal marshals will arrive to take James away to jail.  But in 2 days, James' gang is going to roll into town to bust him out.<br/><br/>Apart from the above supporting characters, there are 3 others in town.  These are:<br/><br/>* Leona Chase: James' girl. Sweltering, manipulative, deceitful. <br/>* Charlie Pierce: James' second in command. Ambitious, treacherous, vengeful. <br/>* Bartholomew Cartwright: Mayer &amp; James' father. Compassionate, torn, fatherly. <br/><br/>Character creation was as normal with the exception of the selection of situation elements.  I took this idea from Hans' GenCon Dust Devils game.  Players had to select one from the first list and one from the second.  The one from the first list had to be unique to each character.  The lists:<br/><br/>List 1: <br/>* Bartholomew's son/daughter <br/>* Deputy\t<br/>* In love with Leona\t<br/>* In James' gang\t<br/>* Here to kill James\t<br/>* In love with Charlie\t<br/><br/>List 2:\t<br/>* Fucking Leona <br/>* Fucking Charlie <br/>* Bartholomew is in your way <br/>* James owes you a fortune <br/>* You owe Charlie a fortune <br/>* Outlaw <br/><br/>I also provided the exact stats for each of the supporting characters to all of the players.  I strongly encouraged them to play the supporting cast when their characters weren't involved in a scene.<br/><br/>So, a pretty detailed AP report on the first game can be found <a href="http://www.grumblingdwarf.com/portal/viewtopic.php?t=1879" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  A pretty detailed report of the second game can be found <a href="http://www.grumblingdwarf.com/portal/viewtopic.php?p=11514#11514" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  Also in that thread can be found AP reports for the other games I mentioned above, as well as some DitV and some SotC.  I won't cover the ground already tread there.  If you want details on the games, read those posts.  I'm going to move directly onto my observations.<br/><br/>My first observation is that Dust Devils is a fucking awesome game.  It's one of my favorites.  It's so simple, yet the mechanics force you down this path on which you learn really important things about your character, things you might have had no idea you wanted to learn.  Regardless of whether the story ends in tragedy or triumph, you get to judge your character as a human being and that character is, inevitably, beautifully flawed.  I started each game by telling the players that Dust Devils is a game about people with a very dark place inside them that gives them strength, but also leads them to tragedy.  I also told them that it's a game about doing violence as a means to your ends.  They took that strongly to heart.  Like my player Sabe said, "What a brutality engine."<br/><br/>Next, the situation elements rocked on toast.  They really started things off with a bang and the two games, despite sharing the same setup, weren't anything alike.  I could probably run the game a dozen times and not have any strong similarities between them.<br/><br/>Finally, an interesting thing happened in both sessions, but particularly in the first one.  In the first scenario, at the end of the game, we discovered that James and Leona (both supporting characters) were the actual protagonists of the story.  They rode off into the sunset after killing all of the PCs and the entire story wound up being about their plot to remove some snakes from their nest.  It was awesome.  In the second session, one of the players wound up playing a supporting cast character for almost the entire game rather than the character he created.  I think that level of engagement with the story was awesome and I'm looking forward to finding more games and/or styles of play that help create that sense of story over character.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/>Daniel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy" title="Yokiboy"><img alt="Yokiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy">Yokiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98849/#Comment_98849" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T01:17:08+00:00" title="September 25, 2007  1:17AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post Daniel!

But, it's definitely the Dust Devils movie of the year, and worth seeing.<br/><br/>Last year's? <i>Seraphim Falls</i>.

I feel like the driving story mojo behind regular Dust Devils is the way that the Devil intersects with a basic sense of humanity, sort of perpendicular to the story being told.  Duty, on the other hand, being a pretty concrete goal and being pretty much morally neutral, doesn't seem to intersect with anything and runs parallel to the story.

The Devil is what makes the system work, really. Duty can put one in a pinch, but it's usually an external rather than internal pressure. (Okay, I suppose the internal pressure comes from the culture; you are morally obligated to live up to your duty. That's not the same, though. You don't have the same feeling of redemption if you commit sepuku (sp?) because duty has put you into a corner.) On the other hand, I love the rephrasing of the card suits into elements.

Do you have an AP report posted?  In my updated version, I have some idea seeds listed that can be used and one of them is the hidden money.  I didn't initially include it because I didn't want it to seem mandatory that the scenario revolved around the money.  Honestly, I've found the mayor hard to get into the action as well, but it's certainly not necessary.  He became a key character the second time I ran it, but the first time nobody chose a situation element related to him, so he went pretty much unused.<br/><br/>Troy,<br/><br/>I'll upload that .pdf and post a link shortly.  Re: Ronin, I'm thinking of a hack that might work.  It basically involves adding some personal items to oppose Duty and having the pursuit of those personal items being what rewards chips.

It pretty much runs itself.<br/><br/>Generally, I'll start up and give people my general blurb about what kind of game Dust Devils is.  Then, I'll point their attention to the little section of things to do when you're not sure what to do next on the .pdf.  After they've made characters, I'll ask if anyone would like to start a scene and I'll let them frame it, possibly with some changes if I feel they're necessary.<br/><br/>Myself, I do very little for the most part.  I almost always let other players whose characters aren't involved in the current scene run the NPCs.  I'll play NPCs if I need to throw in some meat for the sharks to fight over or give a little direction.<br/><br/>When I feel things are slowing down, I tend to focus on the relationships between Charlie, Leona, and James.  I'll usually play Charlie as the guy who wants to take over James' gang and/or get away with his money.  Sometimes that person will be Leona, but sometimes Leona will want Charlie out of the picture instead because she loves James.  It all depends on how the players and their relationships to the supporting cast turned out.  When in doubt, here are things I do:<br/><br/>- Have Charlie contact the player who loves him (as the dominant in the relationship) or the player who is fucking him (as the submissive in the relationship) and reveal that James has buried a fortune somewhere in town.  Leona can do this, too.<br/><br/>- Have Leona contact a player about taking Charlie out before he usurps control of James' gang.<br/><br/>- Have James offer a player a fortune to bust him out of jail.<br/><br/>Basically have one of the supporting cast that's connected in some way to one of the characters ask them for help that'll put them in opposition with another of the supporting characters (who is, of course, tied to another of the characters) for something.  That'll create all sorts of sparks and conflict.  They'll make deals and choose sides.  It winds up bloody and awesome.  Pretty much all you have to do is throw a little tinder on the pile.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/>Daniel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101421/#Comment_101421" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-06T09:33:23+00:00" title="October  6, 2007  9:33AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a question for this scenario.

No plots here. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  It just felt to me that there might be something extra needed if some of the players didn't go for the main gang setup, and also felt like there needed to be an NPC that could serve as some kind of a catalyst for a redemptive path.  But it worked fine as is; there came to be other NPCs in play (w/o Devils), and so far it doesn't seem like many of the players are in a "give up the gun" mode.  We got a very late start and didn't reach The End for any of the characters, but I'm hoping we can finish up the scenario in a second session.<br/><br/>edit:  Gah!

I tend to run Charlie as a purely black-hat sort of fellow, though in the first game of 3 Days in Hell I ran, he wound up pleading with one of the PCs (had the situation elements "fucking Charlie" &amp; "in love with Leona", thus I had Charlie be truly in love with her) to help him get out of the life and start fresh with him.  She turned him down, but there was certainly a redemptive element in play, there.<br/><br/>I think there can be a lot of sympathy for the supporting characters, depending on how they're played.  I wonder if that's something I need to make more explicit, or if it's something folks can just suss out during play.  At this point, I'm not convinced it matters either way.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/>Daniel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/docholaday" title="docholaday"><img alt="docholaday" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/docholaday">docholaday</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101560/#Comment_101560" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-07T16:28:16+00:00" title="October  7, 2007  4:28PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>You can tinker with these things forever. There is a time when you just have to say, "If it works, it works," and let it be what it is. Tinkering might not make it any better, just different, so why not move on and make a new scenario instead.</p>\n<p>What has been really valuable for me is to see the way you structured a one-shot with built in variables that make it fresh each time. The particulars aren't as important in my mind.

I'm going to use the template to make my own Dust Devils scenario for Gamestorm (and other cons).  Something further south during Reconstruction maybe...<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm picturing a sheet that goes out to each player with 13 Devils (Diamonds), 13 Traits (Spades), 13 Past/Presents (Clubs), and 13 Situation Elements (Hearts), each keyed to a playing card.  Deal out the whole deck before play begins.  Each player, referencing the key, can pick a card and pass the rest to the left until all players have a Devil, two Traits, a Past, A Present, and two Situation Elements.  Each player would start with 4 chips and could pay 1 of their chips to change any one of their features either to duplicate  one of the choices already taken or to anything they can think of.  You could really tailor the Past, Presents and Situation Elements to suit the region, period, and situation you want for your game while still offering a lot of freedom and variance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might try something similar for some of my FATE-hack one-shots as well - having a menu of Situation Elements as well as Aspects for a particular scenario.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
