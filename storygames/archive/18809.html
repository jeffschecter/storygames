Pick up a bunch of these, plus some loose change you might find in your pockets, and you've got everything you need to play.<br/><br/>The CC13.5 game featured Dynama, The Haste, Photus and The Seraph: at the the start of the session, I pitched the idea that this was the first time all four heroes of Primopolis were actually meeting face to face and by the end of it they should be in a position to form a superteam. I played Ms. Mob as the villain, who took over from the crime boss of the city and then attempted to absorb and copy all the powers of all the superheroes so that her army of clones would be unstoppable!<br/><br/>We kicked off with a typical 'smugglers at the docks' set-up, with all the players inserting their heroes into the scene as discreet observers (particularly interesting in The Seraph's case, as we asserted that he had large wings, a golden aura and, of course, a fiery sword in one hand) before getting into the action, which almost immediately revealed that the sweeping searchlights which illuminated the scene up to now were in fact the eyes of Photus in his giant-size form! The sharing of narrative authority went well, with one player adding a detail for it then to be expanded upon by another, e.g. the mysterious green glow from the crates was quickly established to be bars of plutonium! The Haste tried to age the plutonium to dust, but made it go critical instead by accelerating its half-life; Photus dealt with the mess by simply eating the remaining bars and containing it in his indestructible body.<br/><br/>Two situations came up during play that weren't adequately covered by the existing rules, but we managed to solve them by adapting the system to fit, rather than having to add any extra modules:<br/>1. When the heroes disagree on a course of action (e.g. should we forgive this person or turn them over to the authorities?) then anyone can spend a coin to enforce their hero's value, so the outcome is resolved their way.<br/>2 Players can co-operate on any attempt to <i>make a difference</i> by using powers and tossing coins in the usual manner: they succeed as long as they collectively get the number of heads required by the Editor and can still spend coins for automatic heads or complicate their associations to retoss a single coin.<br/><br/>Despite the essential rules fitting into a leaflet, I feel the need to write out a proper rulebook for use by the Editor of the game, explaining everything step-by-step, so when I get around to that, I'll also modify the hero playbooks (as the won't need an Editor's page) and add a couple more heroes to the roster while I'm at it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422536/#Comment_422536" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-07T01:13:37+00:00" title="October  7, 2013  1:13AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are two new playbooks for this game now:<br/><br/><i>Hotwire: Mysterious Alien Mistress of Science!<br/>The Witness: Sharp Suited Spectre of the Streets!</i><br/><br/>I'm also working on a separate guidance document for those who want to to run the game, or just get under the hood and see how it works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
