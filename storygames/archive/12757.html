Fastaval 2011 is held in Aarhus Denmark from April 20-24 April. At first we need a synopsis \u2013 a short description of your idea. After the deadline we will select which games are set up at the con, and you will receive more information. <br/><br/>Fastaval is interested in the broad spectrum of rollplaying games and scenarios from larps, story games to structured freeform. The games are selected so there is a divers program with different genres and style. All games on the program will participate in the Otto Awards where a jury will honour the best games in 6 different award categories.<br/><br/>Usually the games at Fastaval are made for 5 players and a game master and takes 3-5 hours of play - I write "usually" because differentiation in playtime, number of plays and game master less games are a common sight. This year we are trying to get more playtime and are therefore, besides the "classic" fastaval games, asking for novalla scenarios with up to 2 hours play time (including set up). And we are doing a special grind night for monsters, madmen and murders - it can be fun or scary but has to be about things in the night. Both novellas and scenarios can be entered for the grind night. <br/><br/>The final contributions should be instructions for a game session. The instructions are not required to be translated to Danish (English or Norwegian, Swedish is fine), but it should be self explanatory so a game master or a group can host/play the game from the instruction alone. <br/><br/>You are not required to attend the con, to make a contribution, but we highly recommend it. <br/><br/>Send your synopsis to rollespil at fastaval dot dk containing the following information:<br/>o Worktitle <br/>o Contact information (name, address, email) <br/>o Short description of contribution (one page at most)<br/>o Expected play time <br/>o Gametype (eg. classic scenario, novella, grind night game)<br/><br/>The synopsis deadline for internationals is Wednesday the 1th September 2010. You will receive more information after the selection and participants with approved synopsis will be offered assistance with concept development, play test and production.<br/><br/>Final submission of the completed games deadline is Monday the 15. February 2011.<br/><br/>On behalf of Fastaval<br/>Kristoffer Rudkjaer                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
