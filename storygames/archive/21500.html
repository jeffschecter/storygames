The tougher the monster, the more rich/pure the fat is. Adventurers will need to render tallow and store them in jars. At least one (probably more) would carry a cast-iron pot with them. Rendering is done during periods of rest. Of course the smell can lead to wandering monster encounters.<br/><br/>The darkness is almost a physical entity. Adventurers cannot abide the dungeon for long, without having to return to the surface. Twelve hours is the maximum length of time an adventurer can spend down below.<br/><br/>Black Spot. Everything an adventurer goes down below, they will get Black Spot. It will start out as just pinprick size, but will grow the more time you spend in a dungeon. Salves and balms will stay the progress, but never completely remove the taint. Magic can get rid of Black Pot, but it is costly.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470273/#Comment_470273" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-28T18:40:21+00:00" title="February 28, 2018  6:40PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2018 6:41PM by yukamichi.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While the nature of dungeon-delving means that adventurers rarely leave behind intact corpses, exceedingly rare examinations of the remains of deceased long-term adventurers have found their internal organs rearranged.

He has all kinds of cool benefits for his worshipers, like bonuses to all the things adventurers do in dungeons anyway; it's a no-brainer, except that this one God is now cornering the market in the most heroic individuals the world has to offer.

It\u2019s not an easy profession.<br/><br/></div></blockquote>\nWhat is adventuring? Really.<br/><br/>We all know what adventuring is. That's easy. Its going to some place for a macguffin, destroying or retrieving said macguffin, and then returning. Hopefully with lots of treasure. Easy right?<br/><br/>But what is adventuring? Really. It's easy to make a little list, but really think about it.<br/><br/>How cold and shitty is a cave? How cramped and dark and damp? It'd probably be drafty too. Your damn socks would get wet. Your toes feel all numb so it constantly feels like there's materiel stuck between them even when there's not. Damp and cold and miserable.<br/><br/>Sure you can carry more than this, but this pack is still heavy. It's killing your lower back and wont stop jostling around funny. Every now and then you think you've got it comfortable but then the damn strap starts cutting off a bit of circulation or it pinches your shoulder. You're looking for a whole horde of the undead right now but you've got this rising primal urge to just throw this stupid ruck off and kick the shit out of it.<br/><br/>Stupid armor is heavy as shit too. It's uncomfortable and the stupid collar keeps riding up into your neck when you're bent over. Damn thigh bits are chafing because everything is damp and stupid. If that buckle doesn't stop biting into your groin, you're going to lose it. Masterwork my ass. You ought to find that guy and give him a piece of your mind.<br/><br/>Oh, great. Here we go. Water. Stagnant water. How does that smell? Not good, huh buddy? I'll bet it's freezing too. Yep. Freezing. Can't let the other guys see you shivering or they'll make fun of you so just grit your damn teeth and keep going. It can't be that deep. Nevermind, its all the way up to your tits.<br/><br/>I'd like to take a point to give special mention to wet underwear. I've been hot. Desert in armor hot. I've been cold. Freezing temperatures wearing nothing appropriate while stuck exposed on the back of a truck. I've slept on rocks. I've been jammed into tight places. Nothing. Nothing is as bad as wet underwear. It's literally the worst feeling in the world.<br/><br/>Now you've got it. Wet underwear. Horde of the undead ahead and here you are tits deep in freezing stagnant water with your stupid armor and your stupid backpack and your wet underwear. The smell too. This water has been stagnant for who knows how long, its got moss and gross crap in it, stuff has probably died in here. Yep, right there. Right at the edge of the light there's something floating. Definitely a carcass of some kind. Air is so thick and that smell. Can't even breathe.<br/><br/>No point in changing your underwear either. Sure it'd be nice to get comfortable before the undead horde, but you're probably just going to have to wade back out the way you came in. Might as well save the dry undies for when you're out of this hell hole.<br/><br/>That stupid Dwarf is laughing again. He's chin deep, what the hell has he got to laugh about? This is ridiculous. I'll bet this stink is making a home in his beard. He probably wont get a chance to wash it for days. What the hell is that crazy bastard chuckling to himself about?<br/><br/>This sucks.<br/><br/>Adventuring sucks.<br/><br/>When you're done here, when you've got your macguffin or destroyed it or whatever, you get to walk for another couple of days to get back where you started from. It's going to be cold. You'll set up your stupid fire and sleep on rocks no matter how well you tried to clear the area below your bed roll. You'll eat your crappy trail rations and this pack is going to be at least twice as heavy from treasure. It better be.<br/><br/>That smell? It's probably going to follow you all the way back.<br/><br/>But really, this here is the good part of the job. As crappy as this is, you haven't even reached the undead horde yet.<br/><br/><br/>Now think about what combat is. Really.<br/><br/>Combat is regularly risking life, limb, and eyesight against terrifying opposition. Consider for a moment what it would be like to have an arm chopped off, and your guts cloven out. Consider what it would be like to lie upon the cold ground spitting blood and gasping for air. Consider the incredible pain and helplessness before the enemy finally kills you.<br/><br/>Don't just think about this stuff, that's not enough. Really imagine it happening to you. What now? Consider all of that. Consider combat and what it means. Consider actually watching things like that happen to your friends, your wards, or even people you barely know.

It\u2019s not an easy profession.<br/><br/></div></blockquote>\nBut what is adventuring? Really. It's easy to make a little list, but really think about it.<br/><br/>How cold and shitty is a cave? How cramped and dark and damp? It'd probably be drafty too. Your damn socks would get wet. Your toes feel all numb so it constantly feels like there's materiel stuck between them even when there's not. Damp and cold and miserable.<br/><br/>Sure you can carry more than this, but this pack is still heavy. It's killing your lower back and wont stop jostling around funny. Every now and then you think you've got it comfortable but then the damn strap starts cutting off a bit of circulation or it pinches your shoulder. You're looking for a whole horde of the undead right now but you've got this rising primal urge to just throw this stupid ruck off and kick the shit out of it.<br/><br/>Stupid armor is heavy as shit too. It's uncomfortable and the stupid collar keeps riding up into your neck when you're bent over. Damn thigh bits are chafing because everything is damp and stupid. If that buckle doesn't stop biting into your groin, you're going to lose it. Masterwork my ass. You ought to find that guy and give him a piece of your mind.<br/><br/>Oh, great. Here we go. Water. Stagnant water. How does that smell? Not good, huh buddy? I'll bet it's freezing too. Yep. Freezing. Can't let the other guys see you shivering or they'll make fun of you so just grit your damn teeth and keep going. It can't be that deep. Nevermind, its all the way up to your tits.<br/><br/>I'd like to take a point to give special mention to wet underwear. I've been hot. Desert in armor hot. I've been cold. Freezing temperatures wearing nothing appropriate while stuck exposed on the back of a truck. I've slept on rocks. I've been jammed into tight places. Nothing. Nothing is as bad as wet underwear. It's literally the worst feeling in the world.<br/><br/>Now you've got it. Wet underwear. Horde of the undead ahead and here you are tits deep in freezing stagnant water with your stupid armor and your stupid backpack and your wet underwear. The smell too. This water has been stagnant for who knows how long, its got moss and gross crap in it, stuff has probably died in here. Yep, right there. Right at the edge of the light there's something floating. Definitely a carcass of some kind. Air is so thick and that smell. Can't even breathe.<br/><br/>No point in changing your underwear either. Sure it'd be nice to get comfortable before the undead horde, but you're probably just going to have to wade back out the way you came in. Might as well save the dry undies for when you're out of this hell hole.<br/><br/>That stupid Dwarf is laughing again. He's chin deep, what the hell has he got to laugh about? This is ridiculous. I'll bet this stink is making a home in his beard. He probably wont get a chance to wash it for days. What the hell is that crazy bastard chuckling to himself about?<br/><br/>This sucks.<br/><br/>Adventuring sucks.<br/><br/>When you're done here, when you've got your macguffin or destroyed it or whatever, you get to walk for another couple of days to get back where you started from. It's going to be cold. You'll set up your stupid fire and sleep on rocks no matter how well you tried to clear the area below your bed roll. You'll eat your crappy trail rations and this pack is going to be at least twice as heavy from treasure. It better be.<br/><br/>That smell? It's probably going to follow you all the way back.<br/><br/>But really, this here is the good part of the job. As crappy as this is, you haven't even reached the undead horde yet.<br/><br/><br/>Now think about what combat is. Really.<br/><br/>Combat is regularly risking life, limb, and eyesight against terrifying opposition. Consider for a moment what it would be like to have an arm chopped off, and your guts cloven out. Consider what it would be like to lie upon the cold ground spitting blood and gasping for air. Consider the incredible pain and helplessness before the enemy finally kills you.<br/><br/>Don't just think about this stuff, that's not enough. Really imagine it happening to you. What now? Consider all of that. Consider combat and what it means. Consider actually watching things like that happen to your friends, your wards, or even people you barely know. Consider that becoming your life\u2019s work. That's combat. Thinking about things like that is the brain of someone who is faced by combat, day in, day out, for any length of time.<br/><br/>What do you do if your leg is violently removed? That is quite a bit of blood loss. There's an artery down there and it squirts like a bastard. What is your plan to stay alive long enough so that help can arrive? Do you even want help to arrive? Is life even worth living after you lose a leg?<br/><br/>What about your eyes? Is life worth living after your eyes have been gouged out by a pair of dirty thumbs?<br/><br/>Every day.<br/><br/>Now consider rationalizing all of that so much that it becomes routine. These thoughts don't even terrify you anymore, sure they get your heart rate up a bit but they're just part of your day. You think about them in the same way a normal person would think about the possibility of their car breaking down on the freeway.<br/><br/>You enter a bar and consider what a battle in there would be like, where is the best place for cover, where are the exits. You regard all of that with the same bored urgency that normal people look around for the bathroom.<br/><br/>That's combat. That's what combat does to people. That\u2019s what realistic threat of combat does to people.<br/><br/>Soldiers and Marines come home from yearlong combat tours that are, honestly, usually pretty combat-lite. Soldiers and Marines do that with armor, weapons, vehicles, air support, and medical technology that is vastly superior to their enemies. Soldiers and Marines do that and are changed, irrevocably, forever.<br/><br/>Soldiers and Marines never had to face a beholder or a dragon or a lich. <br/><br/>Seriously. Holy shit.

She prepares dungeons--underground labyrinths, caverns, or abandoned mines--complete with treasure, traps, and monsters. That's some dangerous shit most sane people wouldn't set foot in unless someone put a knife to their throat. Maybe not even then.<br/><br/>The other players each take on the role of a so-called "adventurer": someone who willingly goes into those places. An adventurer is a person who has decided that the best way for them to make a quick buck right now is to take a deep breath, get down into that dungeon, and hope to make it out alive with whatever wealth they can find below. They probably think the loot will help them achieve something in life, too. Frankly, that's even less likely.<br/><br/>The game is called Kroll because that's what you do: you "kroll" through those dungeons. It's spelled like that because most "adventurers" can't read or write too good.<br/><br/><b>Adventurers</b><br/> <br/>[...]<br/><br/>Adventurers are not normal people. They are often desperate, deranged, or both. That doesn't mean they're necessarily bad people, though: they could be kind, naive, innocent, or merely misinformed. They could even turn out to be heroes in the end. But they're definitely not normal people. Normal, sane people don't climb into dungeons. <br/><br/><b>The Premise</b><br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the adventurers set out on an expedition from a small settlement ("the Town") very near the dungeon. A "dungeon", as described here, is a rare thing: it is a place that's known to hold some treasure or other valuables but is dangerous enough that it hasn't been successfully looted yet. Therefore, the Town attracts small crowds of people calling themselves adventurers: if a given group ever needs to find a new member or replace a fallen comrade, there are many, many fresh recruits ready to join them at the drop of a hat.<br/><br/>Adventurers don't often trust one another. There is a good reason for this: if you and I go into a dungeon and only I make it out alive, I'll be going home with twice as much loot. You'd better hope you can convince the others you've got some useful skills to lend the group, and try win their trust over time.<br/><br/>One of the treasure hunters will be the expedition's "leader". He or she can decide which adventurers join the expedition and how best to put their skills to use. However, the "leader", being broke, just like any other so-called adventurer, can't realistically offer to pay the others. Instead, each will negotiate some share of the wealth recovered, hoping to make it out alive to claim it. This means, of course, that no one's really bound to the leader: you can feel free to follow them or disregard their orders, as you wish. That said, treasure hunters who don't stick together aren't likely to make it very far.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470439/#Comment_470439" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-06T22:02:19+00:00" title="March  6, 2018 10:02PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2018 10:06PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

And probably torches aren't the best idea because they don't last very long and tend to produce a lot of smoke and consume a lot of oxygen.  They can be effective weapons though.<br/>Candles, oil lamps and lanterns are better, but would you really be able to keep them lit while fighting?  Magic lighting would be almost mandatory for dungeoneering.  Or maybe you have a <a href="http://i96.photobucket.com/albums/l196/bellamy-lover-495/IMG_5213.jpg" rel="nofollow">lantern shield</a>?<br/><br/>Until not many years ago, miners used to take canaries with them to spot places filled with poisonous air.  You do have one, right?<br/><br/>Who built the dungeon, and why?  Who/what lives down there now, and why?  How do they move around in the darkness?  What do they eat?  Are they blind?  How far can they see your lights from?<br/><br/>Swords and metal armours are not made of stainless steel.  Unless they are made of bronze - or some fantasy material - they tend to rust, and need care and being oiled often.  Routinely bringing them into damp dungeons could ruin them quite quickly. (How quickly? I have no idea.)<br/><br/>Are there other "adventurers" seeking the same goal as you?  Will you ally?  Fight each other?

Are they literally big holes someone dug in the ground to put monsters in -- in which case what kind of person would do that, and what situation would make it the best thing to do?  If you could just kill them outright, like a dungeon-crawling adventurer does, why put them in the dungeon in the first place?  Figuring that one out might make an interesting game.<br/><br/>Alternatively, they're human-built (or elf-built, dwarf-built, ent-built...) spaces that were abandoned and colonised by monsters.  This then leads to the question of why they're underground.  Two points here:<br/>1. They don't have to be.  You can have a dungeon crawl in a maze of trees just as much as in a maze of tunnels.  Evil dryads, maybe?<br/>2. If they were underground, what would make people build a massive set of catacombs?  Tavern cellars aren't <i>that</i> big.  Perhaps they needed to hide something, but also make sure they could get it back if they needed it in a hurry.  Maybe it's just fallen into the earth over hundreds of years, in which case what was it before?  A once-great palace with a lich king in the throne room would be an eerie dungeon indeed.<br/><br/>Finally, where do the monsters come from once the dungeon has been created?  Are they actually different species, or are they mutated remains of previous adventurers?  If the former, what do they do all day and why do they like the dungeons?  If the latter, what happens to adventurers who spend too long in there?<br/><br/>TL;DR: Your dungeons can have an origin story just as much as your party.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Morrius" title="Morrius"><img alt="Morrius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Morrius">Morrius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470507/#Comment_470507" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-09T23:04:10+00:00" title="March  9, 2018 11:04PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the subject of dungeon delving, I really enjoyed how Torchbearer made going into a dungeon feel like scuba-diving.

If you want to see you have to show a light (or have magical/racial dark vision capability). If you show a light then you advertise your presence to everyone within line of sight and radiated and reflection light extends that to some areas not in line of sight.<br/><br/>Your eyes eventually get more use to being underground but this has the disadvantage of making them more susceptible to blinding through sudden bursts of intense light. That fireball or lightning bolt is going to seriously screw up your vision for a while, never mind light-based spells, tactics or traps specifically designed to blind.<br/><br/>You carry a light source but is it in front of you? Holding a torch in front does not give you the ability to see forwards, it gives you the ability to see the torch and nothing beyond. Holding a torch high is better but how high is the ceiling, and does your arm not have a weapon or shield to carry? How will you deal with a sudden combat, drop the torch and blind yourself just when you need the light the most? Waving a torch into a corner allows you to see what is in that corner but only within a few feet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470637/#Comment_470637" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-13T20:56:12+00:00" title="March 13, 2018  8:56PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Sadurian">@Sadurian</a> <br/><br/>Good stuff!
