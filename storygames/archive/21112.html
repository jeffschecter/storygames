All five events should be such that they put serious wrench in the gears. Two of the events should be pretty ordinary, and one of the three rare events should be very dangerous. A good default time span is one hour.<br/><br/>Work fractally, i.e. you might have a list for "any time, anywhere on Earth" that you can, if you want to, override with "On the streets of Paris, at night" that you can, if you want to, override with "On Rue de la Ferronnerie at night".<br/><br/>Example of "ordinary" wrenches: A black cat starts crying out loudly, attracting attention to the PCs, neighbours will wake up and go to the PCs. A nosy police officer starts questioning the PCs, possibly arresting them. For the unusual wrenches, here's where you put in some attacks from the yog-sothothery du jour. Byakhees attack, maybe. Remember that this might create a time gap depending on when you are in the Kutulu perception cycle for that particular mythos aspect.<br/><br/>Use this format for the lists: [Ordinary blank], [Ordinary plus], [Unusual blank], [Unsual plus], [Unusual and very dangerous minus]<br/><br/>Now, whenever the designated time span passes in the fiction, roll 4dF. It's fine if the keeper does this (do it openly), and does this without calling undue attention to it (explain in advance what this roll means and how it works). The idea is that the keeper is talking in diegetical terms about how time is passing while the players look anxiously at the dice. "You go to bed for the night [while rolling the nightly check, which comes up +\u2610\u2610-, i.e. no wrench]. The next day..." or, "You go to bed for the night [rolls ----, i.e. Byakhee attack, cause for a time gap if players are in phase 1 with Byakhee] and it's ice cold, you reach for the blanket but your hands touch only dew-sogged grass. You're lying naked in a field under the starry sky."<br/><br/>If there are three minuses, look at the last die to see which of the ordinary events happen. If all four dice show the same result, use the face shown to see which of the unusual event happens.<br/><br/>You might also co-assign significant advances in the enemies' plans to the unusual wrenches. They get closer on whatever  clock you've set up behind the screen. But, that doesn't mean there shouldn't also be a wrench; don't just put "there's a blood moon that night", something must happen that the PCs might have to deal with. However, the tables are written down (behind the screen). If the PCs have taken precautions against a particular event, let them benefit fully from those precautions. By "wrench" I mean something that *might* be a wrench, depending on what the PCs are doing.<br/><br/>(Alternative: Use cards, that you flip over, with meanings assigned behind the screen. A tarot deck might be very flavorful if you use the Kult mythos instead of Cthulhu's. About 5/6, 6/7 or so of the cards should be "blank" or just the passingest of fluff. Some scent, a passing feeling... <small>(Because this is combined random table and encounter check in one.)</small>)<br/><br/>Do keep the lists alive, change things on them depending on what happens in the fiction. If you have plenty of ideas (maybe you found online or in another game or in books) you can have a separate big list to pull from and put into these smaller lists.<br/><br/>Note: the time checks don't replace the people and beings that are location keyed. In D&amp;D terms: stock the "dungeon" normally (with receptionists and CEOs and socialites and thugs and cops and priests and byakhees and cultists and what have you), the time checks are the "wandering monster check" on top of that.\n<h3>Examples</h3>\n<dl>\n<dt>Character</dt>\n<dd>"Dr Alice Jones is a great scholar, mediocre fencer, superb chef, and a poor friend.

You're like a grain of sand between its finger and thumb."<br/></dd>\n</dl>\n<h3>Advice</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Prep widely; don't think "funnel to revelation", think "world filled with many mysteries that go <i>deep</i>".</li>\n<li>Don't use a meta resource such as drama tokens, fudge points, fate points, inspiration, or gumshoe points.</li>\n<li>Only use dice for time checks and for things that carry physical risk to the character, such as fights. For non-dangerous situations, either go to player skill or use the listed value, i.e. a "poor friend" won't have contact in the new city (don't make this call subjectively, use some sorta system, principle or keeper-facing rule for it). In 5e terms, "passive abilities" \u2014 compare the character's scores to the scores listed in your prep. It's the ultimate "Let It Ride" from BW: a permanent roll of all blanks.</li>\n<li>Don't use the mountain witch trick for this particular game. Maintain identifying stance. Stay IC always. Players, don't say "Alice goes down to the first floor." Say "I go down to the first floor."</li>\n<li>Never mention numbers.The spirit of the system is for it to be invisible at the table, but based on hard principles behind the screen. It's a sandbox game, complete with maps, prep, random encounters, "prepped hard landscape with player agency w/o any prepped outcomes or plot" that, to anyone listening in, looks like a nineties freeform game.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>"It's impossible to tell CA from transcript." Yes. Make it so. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Therefore, do tell the players beforehand how the game is set up. Perhaps show them some prep (for a different scenario), tell them how the time checks work etc.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463070/#Comment_463070" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-07T10:03:02+00:00" title="May  7, 2017 10:03AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2017 10:03AM by 2097.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<h2>Wicked Archipelago</h2>\nThis one is a classic, just use the setup from IAWA with the gameplay from Archipelago.

That seems like an odd choice, add to that it would be very hard for everyone to role play around the fact that the player openly stated their character <i>was</i> a spy! Especially considering your still trying to win the game. <br/><br/>I don't think its a stretch to make it a rule that all characters begin play with a surface allegiance to the resistance in some form or fashion. But I think players creating gray motives is an amazing idea! Maybe someones only in it for the profit, or their just an anarchist for chaos sake, but you are <i>in</i> the resistance, until the allegiance card says otherwise.\n<blockquote>\u201cDouble whammies\u201d are a controversial part of The Resistance game. It means when two spies both sabotage the same mission, which gives the rez\u2019 a big edge because they know that everyone who weren\u2019t on that mission are good.</blockquote>\nI have never heard of this being controversial, its an integral part of the game. Its a part of the spy's strategy to <i>not</i> place multiple spy's on a team. And a resistance player can actively try and get multiple spy's on a team as a way of forcing them to out themselves or give away a point. Its a huge part of the rational for say something like "Their probably not <i>both</i> spy's because its really hard to coordinate, so its got to be someone on this side of the table!" I mean to each their own, but for every time I've played its never broken game balance.<br/><br/>Anyways, really cool idea I'm interested in hearing your thoughts!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464289/#Comment_464289" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-24T22:50:55+00:00" title="June 24, 2017 10:50PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Every mission is a resistance mission so every character would be one who has reason to be selected for resistance missions.

They could be lying to the state all along, or, trying to spy but turning rez.<br/><br/>Double whammies:<br/>It's always frustrating when someone uses the "they can't be both spies" argument but they did manage to coordinate. I'm interested in new and interesting logic and arguments, not the same old argument game after game. Especially since it's so uncertain, because there are ways to coordinate. It's more frustrating when double whammies happen and it ends a game prematurely (by making a lot of other conclusions obvious).
