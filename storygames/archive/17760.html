I like the original Star Wars trilogy (hey, I saw the first film in its original theatrical run in '77 and it blew my mind) but I wouldn't call myself a "fan". And I have such a vast set of RPGs, most of which I've never played, that I really don't need another one.<br/><br/>But the guys at Penny Arcade seem pretty taken with it, and <a href="http://penny-arcade.com/2012/12/28" rel="nofollow">Tycho sells it pretty well</a>:\n<blockquote>The system calls to mind the brave/weird indie stuff people keep bringing me at shows, with its opposed rolls that deliver metadata about success and failure - in this case, via deliciously abstract quantities of \u201cthreat\u201d and \u201cadvantage.\u201d  Some people don\u2019t like the custom dice they\u2019ve chosen to use, or the idea of them, but I don\u2019t love anything more than custom dice so we may be at an impasse.  It wants you to tell stories, and it wants to help you do that; I don\u2019t have an especially difficult time telling players a story, but if every dice roll is going to act as some kind of Twist Engine by its very nature I\u2019m not going to leave it on the table.</blockquote>Word. I like the idea of funky dice that will tell me more than just how hard I hit the stormtrooper with my axe. And there's a box set for newbies that sounds pretty fun.<br/><br/>So, have any of you tried it yet (either the box set or the paid-beta copy of the full rules)? Is it all that?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
