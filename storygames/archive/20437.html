Atlas is a game that combines mapmaking and world building for 2+ players. It's a game that requires a map, a pencil, and a notebook (or a shared drawing space and a google document). <br/><br/>Its core idea is that someone makes up something new on the map and the other players get to add a detail about it in the notebook. You repeat this process as long as you wish.<br/><br/>This game is noticeably light on rules, but is generally structured in a "come up with the setting and scope of your world and then get building" approach. It offers several variations or iterations of itself to the players. It's very much a guidebook and less a rulebook. <br/><br/>I love this concept because this game just feels like a structured version of a game or something two brothers would do in the backseat of a road trip to somewhere. I think that childhood make believe is the reason the author offers soft sounding suggestions instead of hard rules in the book. I think the author wishes its players tailor how they want to be playing the game. <br/><br/>My personal experience with the game was a 3 player game which became about a single, city that spanned multiple planets via warpgates (think Stargate the TV show.) The scope of our map was galactic, but our palette dictated a few things that made this game very special: An emphasis on non-monocultures, crime but no megacorporations, and retrofuture sci-fi technology.<br/><br/>You can watch the first part of my 3 part series with this game on <a href="https://youtu.be/51F-Tfm5Lqw" rel="nofollow">youtube here</a>.<br/><br/>The game is very engaging. It had me at, several times, looking at the clock thinking "an hour has already gone by? what?!" I think the dualistic Map/Enclycopedia design allows people to be creative in a manner or format that is the most comfortable to them. I know no a lot of gamers like to draw, so the encyclopedia tends to be the medium for introducing story elements. <br/><br/>For even more discussion about this game, myself and the two other players shared our thoughts at the end of part 3 of that video series where we talk about the good and the bad of Atlas.<br/><br/>Atlas is currently a game in development by a friend of my by the name of Tom Fendt, but if you want an advanced copy to playtest on your own, he's asked you contact him personally. He's given me permission to release his email publically (lifeisgoodfella at gmail) just for that! (He'll have a patreon up early '16).<br/><br/>Thank you for reading (and maybe viewing) and I hope, if you're ever looking for a simple map-making game, you might turn and try out Atlas!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
