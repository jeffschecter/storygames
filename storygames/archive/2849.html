Tell me why it's so awesome.<br/><br/>In particular, I'm interested in how (if at all) you elimentate, manage or compensate for the following:<br/><br/>* Absent players.<br/>* High player turnover.<br/>* Scheduling and getting people to show up at the right time.<br/><br/>* Keeping all the players engaged / The Idling Problem (where peopel are reallly slow to repsond owing to being distracted by something else).<br/>* Slowness for other reasons (needing to type, procedural uncertainties like who should speak next, or whether or not you're speaking over one another.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64673/#Comment_64673" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-22T19:18:45+00:00" title="April 22, 2007  7:18PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike's Heroquest IRC game was VERY long-lasting.  More than a year, and dozens and dozens of sessions.  Is it still going?  I dropped out a while back to focus on writing.<br/><br/>We dealt with absent players by having multiple interweaving plots, and multiple windows open for scening.<br/><br/>We dealt with high player turnover by turning away noone for new characters... and by insisting that visitors at least start the process of making new characters.<br/><br/>We dealt with scheduling by, well... showing up on time.  Not much else to do.<br/><br/>Slowness is just a fact of live in IRC.  Don't expect things to happen at a tabletop pace.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64680/#Comment_64680" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-22T20:07:34+00:00" title="April 22, 2007  8:07PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a science-fiction game in IRC that lasted 50 sessions over 2.5 years--maybe 100 hours or so.  The game had difficulties, in part because I was thrashing around trying to go from a "trad GM" to an "indie GM" style without knowing what I was doing.  But when it worked, it was a lot of fun.  I miss those guys: when the campaign ended, we sort of drifted apart, which sucks.  They were great players, I thought we got along pretty well pre- and post-play, and I'm kind of sad they didn't keep in touch.  You'd figure three years of creative collaboration ought to count for something.<br/><br/>The Forge is giving me server errors right now, but I'll splotch up some links when I get a chance, one of these days.<br/><br/>We handled absent players by generally playing without them, sometimes doing one-shots (The Pool, frex) when we knew in advance someone wouldn't make it.<br/><br/>We didn't have any player turnover.<br/><br/>Scheduling--y'know, we were always pretty relaxed about it: but at the same time, after 2 years of play, it became routine.  I wouldn't have dreamed of missing a session, at least not without a very good excuse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64684/#Comment_64684" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-22T21:29:14+00:00" title="April 22, 2007  9:29PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike Holmes needs to answer this one.
