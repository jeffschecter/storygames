Back in the late 70's my younger brother heard about the concept of role playing games (D&amp;D) and explained it to me.  We were both psyched about the idea and since there was no place to buy the game at that time, we wrote our own game.  Very 'kill monsters and take their stuff' kind of fun.<br/>2. Well, we had to take turns playing the game that we wrote*, was 16 at the time.<br/>3. My brother.<br/>4. Nothing.  There was a sloppy joy for the game and the power gaming that went with it.

Almost everyone took turns GMing. GMing was just something everyone did. We also shared the costs of all our gaming books. <br/><br/><b>- What made you<i>actually</i>GM the first time? How old were you?</b><br/>I was 16 at a party and our Shadowrun GM didn't feel like running. He turned to me and said, "you are entertaining, you would probably do a good job, go for it." <br/><br/><b>- Who did you GM for?</b><br/>I GMed for a group of 9-13 people with over 10 people watching at a loud party and I had little idea how the Shadowrun rules worked. After going almost all freeform, we stopped after an hour. <br/><br/><b>- What do you wish you knew back then?</b><br/>Start with a group of 4 people or less. Probably not at a party. Don't run Shadowrun, go with something rules light. Read books on drama, project management, improv, psychology, and acting. <br/><br/><b>- Why did you continue?</b><br/>I didn't for a while. But my gaming group was very supportive of new GMs so I had plenty of chances. <br/><br/>Eventually GMing became one of my favorite activities and I've traveled all over the world playing with GMs people have said were the best of the best to learn their techniques. I've amassed quite a bit of GMIng lore. It's incredibly fun. I also build communities and love hosting events. GMing feels like hosting so it goes hand in hand with my interests. It's also a great way to make friends and I enjoy creating experiences people look forward to after a busy week of stress.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349710/#Comment_349710" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-26T08:20:07+00:00" title="November 26, 2011  8:20AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            - What made you want to do this, before you even tried?<br/>It just seemed like fun.

But there was never enough GMs for the number of people who wanted to play.

Over the course of a school year, we played four or five campaigns, some short-lived and others long-term, and different people DMed them.  There was an expectation that you "owed it to the group" to run a game for everyone else, and the peer pressure worked on me.  I also wanted to play a game that wasn't D&amp;D, and that wasn't happening often enough, so I thought that running a non-D&amp;D game of my own might help.<br/><br/>That said, I ran my first game for other friends from school, because I wasn't comfortable jumping into DMing by running a game for that group.  I wish that back then I had known, christ, ANYTHING that I knew now.  I floundered around, had no idea how to play NPCs, had no idea how to organize anything, it was a mess.  I guess the big thing I would want my younger self to know is that I should never run a game unless I really, really want to run that game, because it's only fun being the GM when I'm enthusiastic about doing it.  GMing because it's my turn or no one else wants to or any other reason just sucks all the fun out of it for me.<br/><br/>I continued initially because I thought, "Hey, I can't possibly do any worse next time," and because I don't like giving up on something after just one attempt.  And once I learned a few things about how to run a game, it got easier and more fun, so it wasn't a hardship to keep going with it.  I started paying attention to what good GMs were doing and asking questions, and trying out stuff on my own, and it started to fall into place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349724/#Comment_349724" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-26T11:19:34+00:00" title="November 26, 2011 11:19AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2011 11:20AM by horn_head_o.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            - What made you want to do this, before you even tried?<br/>The 3e monster manual. My first RPG book I'd seen, it just got me into the hobby. The DMG was my second book, and I knew I wanted to GM.<br/><br/>- What made you actually GM the first time? How old were you?<br/>I introduced the hobby to a couple of close friends, and I was much more well-read in D&amp;D than any of them- most of them had never read any of it, so I was considered GM by default. I was 14.<br/><br/>- Who did you GM for?<br/>All close friends, 4 of them(usually 3 at any given time, scheduling etc.) One who knew nothing, one was an avid 40k wargamer, one had read the 3.5 PHB, and one had heard of D&amp;D, but not much beyond that.<br/><br/>- What do you wish you knew back then?<br/>Surprisingly, not that much. Maybe it's nostalgia, but I have extremely fond memories of the first few adventures I ran. I also recall doing it mostly  through improvising, and doing a lot of the things that I've now learned were very good. It was later that I degraded a bit and fell into some railroading, so I guess I wish my past self knew to stay the course.<br/><br/>- Why did you continue? <br/>Because we loved it! It was a very satisfying night for everyone, and they all wanted me to keep running it! It didn't last long though - not because of group breakage or me getting worse, but because others wanted to try. So I took a loooong break in the player seat. I'm usually the one to GM for newly introducing games still though, which I find very fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo" title="1000buffalo"><img alt="1000buffalo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.jadelantern.com/lantern/images/GoPlayLantern.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo">1000buffalo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349731/#Comment_349731" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-26T14:16:05+00:00" title="November 26, 2011  2:16PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, why not  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  I've been gaming - continually - since, ah, about 1978, so it's a little fuzzy for me ...<br/><br/>- What made you want to do this, before you even tried?<br/>I loved make believe and roleplaying (as a kid, which I was at the time - 8.), and had read the Hobbit and gotten into writing, and loved swords &amp; sorcery and sci-fi. <br/><br/>- What made you actually GM the first time? How old were you?<br/>I was 8 or 9. I eventually got the D&amp;D Basic (Holmes) from my Mom - she got it at K-Mart, as I recall, and it was around the winter of 1979. I know once I had that, I started DMing, so we'll say 9. Why? Well, I was the one with the book for one thing, and I loved - loved - the ideas and potential. I loved Lankhmar and Conan and Tolkien and King Arthur and Robin Hood and I loved D&amp;D. I'm sure in part I DMed because I was a control freak, and in part because I couldn't pick just one PC or setting. By High School, I had DMed for about 4 years, and had read Dragon continually, so was usually the choice for DMing anything among my friends.<br/><br/>- Who did you GM for?<br/>Anyone I could find: my younger brother, my friend Corky, and then kids at Middle School. By High School, I had a regular group of 3 players with occasional guests, and we played nearly every weekend at someone's house.<br/><br/>- What do you wish you knew back then?<br/>About DMing? Not too much - maybe a little more about player narrative rights and such.<br/><br/>- Why did you continue?<br/>Because I have the best fun, stories and friends ever as a result of gaming (and to some extent GMing).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AJohandsome" title="AJohandsome"><img alt="AJohandsome" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AJohandsome">AJohandsome</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349732/#Comment_349732" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-26T14:26:09+00:00" title="November 26, 2011  2:26PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            - What made you want to do this, before you even tried?<br/>I've always wanted to write a book, but I've not got the attention span necessary to sit down and hammer out the pages. GMing allows me to get the story seeds I've got in my head into action, so to speak. I've always created small stories, or the beginnings of stories. GMing seemed like the logical next step, with the added bonus of being surprised when the story takes a different turn than I originally expected. <br/><br/>- What made you actually GM the first time? How old were you?<br/>I bought Call of Cthulhu. Someone had to GM, and I owned/read the book. <br/><br/>- Who did you GM for?<br/>The same group I've always played with, friends from kindergarten and up. Roleplaying games create lifelong friendships!<br/><br/>- What do you wish you knew back then?<br/>That railroading is ok sometimes, but mostly not. That all conflicts need a reason, and that they all need to have an outcome the players can get behind. And also that the dice/cards/whatever are there for a reason, and that they need to be used. And lastly, that the rules are just rules, not commandments. <br/><br/>- Why did you continue?<br/>The laughs, the stories and the mountain of dead dragons. I'll never stop thinking up stories about things, and I really like the dynamic outlet GMing and roleplaying games offer in that respect. Also, I get to feel cool!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SavageHominid" title="SavageHominid"><img alt="SavageHominid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SavageHominid">SavageHominid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349768/#Comment_349768" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-28T03:04:42+00:00" title="November 28, 2011  3:04AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            - What made you want to do this, before you even tried?<br/>My Dad GM'd my first few games, being an impressionable youth I knew I had to as well.<br/><br/>- What made you actually GM the first time?

Not everyone likes being killed by rats. <br/><br/>- Why did you continue?<br/>Being homeschooled had damaged my ability to make friends. Most homeschoolers, I met, were a bit too square for me. Running D&amp;D at summer camp made me some friends, and weirdly enough I can trace a lot of friendships (through degrees of separation) back to D&amp;D, it is a bit eerie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349800/#Comment_349800" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-28T10:02:06+00:00" title="November 28, 2011 10:02AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            - <b>What made you want to do this, before you even tried?</b><br/><br/>There was allure associated with being the center of attention, the authority and the creative driver.<br/><br/>- <b>What made you actually GM the first time? How old were you?</b><br/><br/>I was maybe ten.  I played with my parents and my mom ran our first adventure and then my dad took the role of primary GM for years.  They would occasionally suffer through short-games that I ran when I we were first playing RPGs.  I suppose what made me <i>actually</i> do it was my parents' forbearance.<br/><br/>- <b>Who did you GM for?</b><br/><br/>My folks.<br/><br/>- <b>What do you wish you knew back then?</b><br/><br/>How to be an adult?  I know that's not a helpful answer, but I'm not really sure what would be -- there are so many early lessons.  For that kind of play (AD&amp;D1), a thing that's important is not not try to outdo what you just did -- not every time.  You need to avoid too-rapidly escalating tension, power, treasure, etc.  I guess when I look back at what I'm embarrassed by at that age, it's that kind of thing.  By the time I was 16, I was a sought-after GM by my folks and at cons and stuff.  More one-shot or short-game stuff than real campaigns.<br/><br/>- <b>Why did you continue?</b><br/><br/>Someone has to.  It's not my preference usually but sometimes you have to chip in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349891/#Comment_349891" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-28T23:27:43+00:00" title="November 28, 2011 11:27PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2011 11:28PM by Wilhelm.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            - What made you want to do this, before you even tried?<br/><br/>I can't remember.<br/><br/>- What made you <i>actually</i> GM the first time? How old were you?<br/><br/>In the crowd I played with in the beginning it was just assumed that we would take turns running the game.  Later it settled into a few regular GMs, but the first year it went round robin, IIRC. I must have been 10-12.<br/><br/>- Who did you GM for?<br/><br/>Classmates.<br/><br/>- What do you wish you knew back then?<br/><br/>Nothing.  we were 10-12 year olds. Exploring the game was the whole idea.  If I were to go back and run a game for those kids today, I might do things differently. But for what the game was, I wouldn't change anything.<br/><br/>- Why did you continue?<br/><br/>I am a story teller, but I don't have the patience or skill to write novels.  Sitting behind the GM screen gives me an outlet for that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349980/#Comment_349980" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-29T17:20:15+00:00" title="November 29, 2011  5:20PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>What made you want to do this, before you even tried?</b><br/>I read <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> and I wanted to play it, but no one else in our group seemed interested in GMing it. Also, I was in the punk scene, and an Eagle Scout veteran of hundreds of campfires, and was already super-enthusiastic about participatory media. Oh, and the Oulipo! I had just discovered them, too. I was charged up about the idea of game rules as potential literatures, and Cthulhu was already a well-worn potential literature in traditional, written form. It seemed like a good set of constraints for other forms of quasi-literary expression.<br/><br/><b>What made you actually GM the first time? How old were you?</b><br/>I was 19 when that fateful Saturday rolled around, when I was involved in no standing game at the Gaming Club. I figured failing at being a GM was preferable to doing nothing, or to just playing Magic again (we did that every day, and Saturday was for RPGs!).<br/><br/><b>Who did you GM for?</b><br/>And so it was that I GM'd for the subset of our D&amp;D/OWOD Werewolf group that was still in Pittsburgh for the summer.<br/><br/><b>What do you wish you knew back then?</b><br/>First and foremost: You don't need to have all 10 people in the same game! Second: There's no GM task you can't delegate to another player. I'm OK with having taken years to learn everything else, but those two would have ratcheted my stress level down a ton. I really burned myself out over those first few months of what became a very long campaign.<br/><br/><b>Why did you continue?</b><br/>If I GM'd, we played just the games I wanted to play. If I didn't, we didn't. Just that simple. No one else was enthusiastic about running Cthulhu, Puppetland, etc., so they fell to me. And as I got better at getting out of everyone's way - as I got to step out of the spotlight more and more - I really started enjoying the GM role.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
