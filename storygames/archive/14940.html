Perhaps people who are most familiar with Europe create fantasy settings that reflect the idea of 'nations' as they arose in early modern Europe.<br/><br/>But Paizo and Wizards of the Coast are both based in the United States, and my impression is that most RPG companies are as well (or at least in North America). Isn't there a desire to use fantasy to tell stories of colonisation and immigration, to create US-like and Canada-like and Mexico-like fantasy countries that aren't obvious analogues like Maztica?<br/><br/>It's true that the pseudo-medieval period is a little before 1492, but:<br/><br/>(a) The age of colonisation has been done in fantasy settings, I'm thinking in particular of Maztica. There, however, an obvious analogue was used. It could have just as easily been (I would have thought) a Mesoamerican-style country in the same way the Dalelands are European-style.<br/><br/>(b) Themes of colonisation could easily be explored without the age of colonisation. The Anglo-Saxons are named after two waves of colonisers, and they were colonised in turn by the Normans! <br/><br/>Am I missing something? I'd love to hear your thoughts.<br/><br/>(To give you some context, I'm an Australian who's been thinking about how to write fantasy in vaguely Australasia-style countries/colonies. I'm also fiddling with the <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/Awen" rel="nofollow">Awen</a> character creation rules to see if they can create more 'colonial' settings.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339728/#Comment_339728" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-20T05:08:30+00:00" title="August 20, 2011  5:08AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't human/elf tension from deforestation a common troupe?

Different countries have different genre tropes.  Some of the countries are certainly explicit analogues for European nations - Irrisen is Russia, there are TWO analogues for revolutionary France (Andoran for republican idealism, Galt for the terror), while others are not.  <br/> Nonetheless, the setting is full of the rise and fall of empires and the legacy of waves of various invasions.  The "current time" of the game is set when most of the great Western empires are waning and giving way to younger, more vital nations, but the legacy of colonialism is certainly explored.  Qadira is the semi-independent westernmost province of a great Caliphate that stretches out to the east of the mapped world of the sourcebooks, and Qadira's relationship to its rulers is a big part of that setting's politics.  Nidal is a client state of ancient, decadent Cheliax that won its independence as a reward for helping the winning side in a secession struggle, and is now trying to exert its influence on its former master.  And so on.<br/><br/>There is even one country explicitly dedicated to issues of colonialism in the most explicit and straightforward sense.  Sargava is a colony of white Cheliaxians who conquered a section of the black Mwangi Expanse to set up plantations, exploit natural resources, etc.  Sargava was maintained by Cheliax's power, but in the wake of Cheliax's civil war the colonists are now on their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339732/#Comment_339732" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-20T06:52:03+00:00" title="August 20, 2011  6:52AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for those details, Sam!

It's also easier to keep track that X nation is full of elves and Y nation is full of orcs, rather than Y is the homeland of the elves, but most of them left, but some are now returning, but others have spread out, etc.<br/><br/>Wilmer, I'm not sure that the tensions between elves and humans in many settings are quite the same. I see that more as competition for resources rather than the colonisation of the lands of one people by another.

A lot of people feel like they know something about China or Japan, but how many people know much about historical Chinese-Tibetan or Japanese-Ainu relations, or even lesser-known issues like the traditional ethnic differences between North and South China that various governments have tried to downplay or smooth over?  Not many.  And even if you did, that's not the kind of thing typically depicted in fantasy settings, so it would stand out as unusual. Additionally, I think many roleplayers and designers like to have a ethnically diverse world (D&amp;D has always been obsessed with race, right?) without having to really deal with racial issues except on a surface level (elves and dwarves don't like each other, but eventually get over it and become good friends).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339741/#Comment_339741" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-20T09:31:31+00:00" title="August 20, 2011  9:31AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Also politics are less interesting than killing dragons, so fantasy games are about dragon killing instead of taxation without representation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339745/#Comment_339745" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-20T09:56:27+00:00" title="August 20, 2011  9:56AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a strong drive towards same old, same old in fantasy gaming - it's a conservative genre. This is simply because it's the introductory genre for people, it's the most prestigious one, and it's the one people get stuck on most often. This means that at any given time there are many people in roleplaying who have either never "done" faux-medieval roleplaying, or do it because it's what they know, or do it because they're creatively stuck on finally getting Dragonlance right or whatever. A completely natural phenomenon mostly explained by demographics and cultural history of roleplaying (that is, D&amp;D was there first, and it was faux-medieval), although medieval fantasy might be somewhat particularly suited to this role in the cultural landscape, too.<br/><br/>Anyway, I agree with the sentiment - getting out of the medieval times in D&amp;D is insanely exciting. I've been running a campaign set in fantasy 17th century, and D&amp;D handles that just fine. The action has mostly centered on continental Europe-equivalent so far, but it's a great comfort to me to know that the whole enchillada of what we recognize as adventure is actually out there and available, much more so than it would be in a seriously medieval setting: all the essentially colonial "pirate specials" and "Egypt specials" and such that often feature in D&amp;D adventures are much, much more sensible in setting terms when your setting is post-medieval. I can even do convincing medievalism by postulating that part of the continent is still pretty backward, like Eastern Europe largely was historically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339747/#Comment_339747" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-20T10:00:07+00:00" title="August 20, 2011 10:00AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Other than Maztica, I can think of Northern Crown and Septrionalis which are both colonial adventures in fantasy equivalents of America/Canada.<br/><br/>And I assume you're just skipping games set in actual colonial times like Colonial Gothic?<br/><br/>As for why it hasn't happened, I assume just because those settings/issues didn't yet tickle a designer's fancy.

You may have a unique angle here.<br/><br/>Historical wargamers have fixated on the various colonial periods for decades. Fun stuff if you do not sympathizes the the natives much.

I agree those are interesting themes, and I've enjoyed game settings that use them -- one that comes to mind is "Swashbucklers of the 7 Skies", in which the major sky-islands were settled in successive waves of colonization from the oldest one, with one of the islands still in the middle of the process, with a vaguely-Polynesian indigenous culture that's being "civilized" somewhat against its will.<br/><br/>There's also "Deadlands", with an alternate-19th-century America where some of the major Native tribes have re-established their own territories.\n<blockquote>(d) Why are there more crumbling or vanished empires than new polities?</blockquote>\nIt's Romantic with a capital R.

It is the a mythic Americas (both south and north) approx: 1000-1200.  The Vikings in this alternate history are very, very much colonizers, having taken over much of the NE of the America/Canada.  I'm really excited about this product, it screams a marriage of Sword and Sorcery to the manifest destiny of a wide vista of things to be explored.  <br/><br/>My most succesful fantasy campaign was set in the Forgotten Realms, but I threw out tons and tons. I had printing presses and mystical gunpowder invented by the dwarves.   What was left was 6 Elven enclaves, a few dwarves and a continent very depopulated by disease and war... the main assumption was that<b> magic was coming back</b>... because I was so bored with "the magic fades" ideas.  Elven and dwarven birth rates were off the chart.  Dimensional portals were popping everywhere as "wildways" making the continent of FAerun much smaller.  And what grew out of about 6 years of gaming, was a very strong elven campaign of rebuilding Myth Drannor ('a grand crusade") and restoring the elven nations/enclaves to one united nation-state.  I had my Benjamin Franklin diplomat Elf as one of the player's PCs.  There were arguments over how many elven craftspeople and treesingers were allowed to immigrate to Myth Drannor in game, yup, my players were dealing with outsourcing.  There was a real push to integrate dwarf and humans into the great, new elven society.  But it wasn't bloodless or easy.  It was a very cool campaign and we've just started talking about reviving it over a skype/maptools game.  <br/><br/>I had an NPC, Spartacus type, in the desert kingdoms overthrow those old gov'ts and then ended slavery.  But his nation was then crippled by the economic upheveal and chaos.  Best intentions and all that.  <br/><br/>I was very much drawing from 17th and 18th century societal pressures.  Good fun, very invested players helped.  And that 2 of them were trained historians didn't hurt either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emeraude" title="Emeraude"><img alt="Emeraude" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emeraude">Emeraude</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339779/#Comment_339779" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-20T16:04:46+00:00" title="August 20, 2011  4:04PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as colonization is concerned, in French we've had Guildes, which was basically fantasy discovery of the new world, with players playing the agents of the euro-power equivalent trying to map/conquer get rich thanks to the fantasy New World.<br/><br/>There was also Shaan, a tougher beast, with its clear anti-colonialist political intent - in which you played the inhabitants of  relatively low-level technology planet being invaded and colonized by humans.<br/><br/><br/><b>Also politics are less interesting than killing dragons [...]</b><br/><br/>I think the problem with politics generally is that it exist on a totally different time-frame than combats. It's easy to deal with slaying a dragon: a few tactical decisions, some dice rolls, and everything is resolved, almost simultaneously in game and around the table.

The power of stereotypes is a pretty big deal, too, as well as a certain idea of Europe and the rest of the world that Americans have, which Woodrow Wilson articulated in his doctrine of national self-determination. That's been a pretty powerful cultural idea all through the 20th century.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sanglorian</cite>(b) Why is it that 'European' fantasy countries aren't clear analogues of real-world European countries but non-European fantasy countries typically are?</blockquote>\nWhat do you mean by "countries"? India and China might be European-style nation-states today, but culturally they are closer to Europe than to France or Spain. As Nolan points out, Kara-Tur is a mish-mash of China just like many fantasy settings are pan-European mish-mashes. However, you do see various games that use analogues of European nations, like Warhammer FRP or 7th Sea for example, but you never see role-playing games with fictional analogues of the various actual Indian or African states. As you suspect, it's because most people playing and writing rpgs are more familiar with Europe and European history than the non-European (and non-American) world. And while American history and legend isn't a main source for obvious fantasy tropes, I think American attitudes towards nature and the wilderness have had a pretty powerful effect on D&amp;D through the years.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sanglorian</cite>(c) Why do few fantasy settings have 'imperialism', 'immigration' or 'colonisation' as a theme?</blockquote>\nFantasy heroes are supposed to be heroes. That said, I think D&amp;D started out with some pretty explicitly colonial themes, with Keep on the Borderlands as one example. As the Tolkeinesque adventure aspect became more dominant than the dungeoncrawling Swords of Shahrazar aspect, opportunities to be back-stabbing, money-grubbing scoundrels became fewer, while do-gooder quest-monkeys became more prevalent.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sanglorian</cite>(d) Why are there more crumbling or vanished empires than new polities?</blockquote>\nIt makes for dungeons, plain and simple.

The size of the wilderness is an influence, there's just more of it in America, and it's more romanticized.

They existed in the past and were wiped out, so now you can say a few things about what they were like. And you don't need to be very detailed, because the specific details about a specific leader and how he feels about several topics and issues isn't really relevant, unless those views inform a specific artifact that the PCs may encounter (an item or location or whatever).<br/><br/>Relatively static and homogenous nations are also relatively easy to document. You can make sweeping statements about things and they will be true. Or at least true enough. And if there's an exception, an individual GM can put that exception in for their game and make a plot point of it.<br/><br/>But colonial, imperial, immigrant, etc. locations are harder to document. You have to document at least twice as much cultural information (and the people using your setting have at least twice as much to digest and remember).<br/><br/>And colonial, imperial, immigrant locations tend to be much more in flux and changeable. This is a HUGE deal for a setting publisher.<br/><br/>If you're planning to publish 20 books about a setting, it's in your best interest to have that setting difficult to change, other than the changes that happen in your official metaplot timeline.<br/><br/>Because if you create settings that are relatively fragile and changeable, then by the time you produce another book, a given game group may well have changed the setting in a way that the new book doesn't make sense anymore - it's starting assumptions about the situation don't jive with what has been happening in that campaign. So you lose a sale.<br/><br/>Relatively static settings are much less likely to have this problem.<br/><br/>Not that I like setting metaplot and "official timelines" and all that. But I can understand why they would impact decisions made by developers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339998/#Comment_339998" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-22T11:36:41+00:00" title="August 22, 2011 11:36AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sanglorian</cite>Levi, it's interesting you say that because I thought the opposite when I read Awen - that it discourages a colonial theme.

There's so much visual information about these myths it's a lot easier to visualize yourself inside this fiction. So it's actually easier to sell another occidental medieval fantasy instead of a brand new rpg about a culture you haven't dreamt of.<br/><br/>Let's try an experiment to prove this: Try to picture yourself in the peruvian medieval times. More precisely, the muchik culture. <br/>Yes, we have metals, though not so much. And brass is perhaps the hardest thing we have, aside from stone.<br/>Yes, we have warriors, though not exactly an army. And they are more like priest-warriors.<br/>No, we haven't got horses and llamas are for carrying stuff, not for riding<br/>Yes we know the wheel, but it's a sacred symbol (and totally useless in our geography) and thus machinery hasn't evolved in that way.<br/>We've got a theocratic society centered around the temples.<br/>Yes, we have human sacrifices. Though it's an honor being considered fit a sacrifice for the gods.<br/><br/>Now, try not to think you're not a half-dressed barbarian. And no, you haven't got bows nor arrows. Probably by this time you've got a puzzle with a ton of missing things in your head and a lot of questions, even when we started with the word "medieval" to define it. And probably your imagination recurred to what you know of ancient south america, aztec and maya culture or even further to get an idea of what you see.

And for very good reason. They have to be sold to a broad audience to make any profit, and challenging stuff appeals less broadly and loses sales.<br/><br/>I think you'd probably find more examples of people putting challenging themes into their home games than you would find in broad-market published settings. And that makes sense and isn't really wrong or anything. It's an expected outcome of the market.<br/><br/>I think the number of people who express the opinion "I play games to have fun and I want it to be easy for me to do that. I don't want to be deeply challenged and emotionally triggered most of the time." far out ways those who feel they want those things consistently. And there are games for those latter people. We talk about those games here a lot. And the vast majority of those games don't have published setting books at all. On purpose. <br/><br/>So that's another part of the answer: the people who want to explore those tougher themes are, broadly speaking, more likely to be making up their own worlds and not buying published settings anyway.<br/><br/>Because "colonial", "imperial", "New World" are themes, they're not just color.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340571/#Comment_340571" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T03:14:49+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  3:14AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, some really interesting responses here.

The only experience I've had with colonialism in gaming was in a homebrew fantasy world, which was about humans with steampunk technology colonizing a continent of conventional fantasy races (elves, dwarves, dark elves), with the humans looting, killing, and enslaving everything and everyone they could find. After decades of this the colonized races united and fought back, and the end result was an uneasy peace where the humans got to keep most of their coastal holdings. I found it bittersweet yet true to life, but I don't see it becoming a mass market success even though Korea has some fairly recent experience with colonialism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_340573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340573/#Comment_340573" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T03:49:04+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  3:49AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2011 3:52AM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

I'm really interested in portraying cultural arrogance in roleplaying games. And arrogance may be had in abundance both in <i>colonial</i> and <i>New World</i> games. Why do you ask?<br/><br/>You know, we have related issues here in Norway; the sapmi people have been badly treated for ages. There are still sores festering in that part of the population over here. There's a lot of bitterness, shame and alcoholism amongst old sapmi folks. And you still find anger, suspicion and prejudice on both sides. I'm partly sapmi myself, and have been interested in our history since the early eighties. I find it fascinating how cruel and blind people can be, and how easy it is to demonize "the others".<br/><br/>In fact I'm so inspired by this thread that I have decided to set my professional campaigns this fall to such a setting. The prime setting for my frpg <i>Fabula</i> is <i>Orianna</i>, a land taken by humans from peaceful orc-tribes a long time ago. Now I want to go back to those times, when the humans first came and began settling the orc-lands. I want to sow arrogance amongst my players, pit them in conflicts with the "savage" orcs, and see where we end up ...<br/><br/>I have to draw some new Orianna-maps, with the olden orcish culture and settlements present, to frame and feed the game properly. And I will have to think it through; how to present the orcs, how to engage the players in a meaningful interaction that grasp the theme. It's a heavy task, but I believe it will be worth the effort. <br/><br/>I really look forward to playing this! I'm sure my players will have a great time too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MichaelTumey" title="MichaelTumey"><img alt="MichaelTumey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MichaelTumey">MichaelTumey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340657/#Comment_340657" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T14:52:57+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  2:52PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2011 3:11PM by MichaelTumey.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Wait, didn't we have a thread a month or two ago (the one called "Occidental Adventures" or something like that) making fun of the way that 'Oriental' fantasy settings are almost always inaccurate mashups of completely unrelated cultures and time periods? (I.e. kung-fu ninja snake-charmers\u2026).</blockquote>\nI'd like to respond to this, since I wasn't a member before a few days ago. I am the concept creator for a published setting that thus far has only a 3 part introductory mini-arc released and 2 supplement books - with more releases coming over the next few months. Kaidan: a Japanese Ghost Story setting is an analog Japanese emprie crossed with a horror system -something like Ravenloft.<br/><br/>Kaidan is not a mashup, in fact it borrows concepts and tropes exclusively from pre-Sengoku (thus pre Edo/Tokugawa) Japan. It is a fictional place however, I borrow an actual historical event that occurred at the end of the Genpei War, 1185 AD. Kaidan is ruled by undead formed by a curse uttered in the last battle of that war, so in a sense, the historical timeline stops prior to the Kamakura shogunate, twisting history so that the losers of the Genpei War actually inherit this Japan analog. Kaidan best fits a Japan like nation somewhere between 1200 and 1450, as it was in the pre-Sengoku Shogunate run state of Japan.<br/><br/>I am half Japanese, have made a lifetime of study of Japan's history, culture, religion, folklore and ghost stories - I have family there, and historian cousins that I compare my research with all the time. Lots of 'Japan' settings like Kara-Tur are mash-ups of Japan, China, SE Asian tropes as one oriental place. Kaidan is strictly based on Japan only - no mash ups with other oriental cultures. There are indigenous barbarian tribes similar to Ainu/Emishi of old Japan, as well as a similarly realized Hengeyokai (animal based shapechangers - PC race). The fictionalized religions of the setting are loosely based on Shinto, Buddhist, Shugendo and Goryo Shinko (religion of ghosts), as well as Ojigami - ancestral worship.<br/><br/>While the setting mostly relies on kaidan monogatari - Japanese collections of ghost stories translated to English since 1899, there are some elements of anime, and J-horror. Many of its tropes have been barely introduced to western culture. The setting is richly detailed and the social castes and their uniqueness from one to the other is captured - as it is closely tied to the demented reincarnation mechanic and the Buddhist Wheel of Life concept (a part of its dark mechanics).<br/><br/>Although I too played in Kara-Tur, as well as some adventures in D&amp;D Rokugan - both failed to meet my expectations of Japan, as I am familiar with it, and Kaidan is my attempt to capture Japanese culture/history/religion/folklore in a way that no previous setting to my knowledge does that well. I also correct many mistaken concepts that appeared in previous oriental D&amp;D concepts like Yamabushi instead of Shugenja (shugenja is a word taken out context meaning a worshipper of Shugendo, not a priest), samurai is a social caste, not a class - though several classes fit in the samurai caste. My PC races: Kappa, Hengeyokai and Tengu closely follow Japanese tradition, and not pre-existing Americanized concepts.<br/><br/>While Kaidan is not Japan, it is more Japanese than anything you've played before. It may be true that previous D&amp;D renditions of the orient have been a hit or miss, Kaidan hopes to fix all those misconstued ideas of fantasy feudal Japan, and bring the Japanese view to the west. To the Japanese superstition is not epic folklore, it is completely treated as horror, as the Japanese treat it.<br/><br/>Here's a link to all the Kaidan releases currently available from the Paizo Store: <a href="http://paizo.com/store/byCompany/r/ritePublishing/pathfinderRPG/kaidan" rel="nofollow">Kaidan: a Japanese Ghost Story setting</a> as it is a setting designed for use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.

The adventurers are most likely from a typical European analog - normal D&amp;D/PF characters. <i>The PCs are the immigrants</i>. Detailed in the setting are language barriers, a misunderstanding of cultures on both sides east vs. west, the PCs spells/powers are somewhat mitigated by differences in how magic works and other darker conditions of the setting. The whole point of the intro arc is to introduce a party of players from a typical western setting to do a mission in an exotic and xenophobic empire that has only recently opened its borders to foreign trade. Depending on how the GM runs the adventures, the party could end up staying as permanent immigrants adventuring in a foreign land that becomes their new home - but that's only one possible outcome of the adventures.<br/><br/>I thought it was on topic, sorry for the link - it was more to justify that I was talking about a real product, and not some undeveloped home-brew idea.<br/><br/>I just didn't agree that all oriental settings are mash-ups, by default, mine is not.<br/><br/>(and I didn't copy/paste it, I typed it all in by hand...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340675/#Comment_340675" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T18:23:25+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  6:23PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the comments guys, they're great.<br/><br/>Do you think colonialism can be explored in a regular fantasy game?

Many of us live on the ruins of other peoples' ways of life, and thus have benefited from colonialism or are suffering from its consequences. If you're American, Canadian, Japanese, South American, or from anywhere in Western Europe chances are you owe your way of life to colonialism. Good things and bad have resulted from colonialism, and often the picture is very complex (as in the case of mixed-heritage individuals like Tomas on this thread), but the fact of the matter is that we live in a world shaped by colonialism. To anyone but those who are suffering directly from it it's not a big deal in everyday life, though there will be reminders from time to time.<br/><br/>So drawing on reality, one way to handle the issue would be to work out the history of a region, i.e. who originally lived there and how did they subsist on the land, then what group made incursions and how did <i>they</i> live off/profit from the land. So you could have farmers displacing hunter gatherers, or miners and merchants displacing farming communities, industrialists displacing plantation farmers, etc. Depending on where the adventure is and what stage the colonialist activity is in, the PCs could be in any state from actively involved/unwantedly swept up, to far from the action and hearing occasionally about it while going about their lives, to living in a safely conquered world and enjoying its benefits while having occasional reminders of how things used to be. Or they could be dealing with its repercussions.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>either the colonisers or the natives explicitly evil</blockquote><p>This, either way, is a way to make an exploration of a real issue into a ...gross, bad thing.</p>\nDepends on the perspective of evil. If it's just a "script" that both sides are working from, with each side caught up in <a href="http://thrivebydesign.org/?p=96" rel="nofollow">the myth of pure evil</a> about their enemies, I think it's a very cool way to build up tension and conflict. If the evil is the objective "reality" of the campaign, the suspension of disbelief will probably break down and the fiction of the game will probably end up being shallow, with the evil side becoming little more than sources of experience points and loot. I don't think the latter is bad play, by the way, just not the best way to explore a subject like colonialism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_340688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340688/#Comment_340688" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T23:05:27+00:00" title="August 26, 2011 11:05PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2011 11:11PM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sanglorian</cite>Do you think colonialism can be explored in a regular fantasy game? I mean one which is at turns light-hearted and serious, stereotypical and innovative. Colonialism might come up for an adventure or two, or in a bit of dialogue, in a character arc or the like, but not be the main focus. I'm not sure if that style of game could do it justice.<br/></blockquote>I expect to have my campaigns this fall to have colonization as main focus, and my game is certainly a regular fantasy game. I expect the theme to fill my campaigns with lots of interesting issues, and I expect the theme to fill the game-sessions with a broad mixture of challenges and conflicts. I'll certainly try my best to make it so. ;-)<br/><br/><b>Here's some thoughts on how I will do it:</b><br/><br/>I'll go a long way in demonizing the natives initially, of course, to mirror the way it often work in real life. This will start before the PCs really meet the natives themselves. I'll prep the characters/players with stories of atrocities, and help them prepare for the violent nature of the natives (arming them both mentally and physically, will help them into violent actions later). But my agenda is more than having the colonizing PCs fear and fight the natives. <br/><br/>I'll have to stress that they are here to <i>build</i> something too; a farm, a livelihood, a new life. Their is a journey of hope, mainly. They are settlers first, and defenders of their faith, family and future next. I want them to be a mixed group, with a broad range of cares to follow up on.<br/><br/>When we go into the lands, I'll meet the characters with strange behaviors that may seem threatening. I'll let them face fear and aggression (demonizing the PCs in the eyes of the natives). I'll turn the screw on conflicts as far as the players let me, while going into more and more nuances in how the natives are described and played. <br/><br/>The nuances is where I expect the game to become really interesting. How will you react when met with kindness from "these demons"? How will love between man and "demon" be treated? How do you deal with the hungry family of your native guide? How do you deal with natives in rage over your own atrocities? How do you deal with your own hope in the face of violence and possible war?<br/><br/>Playing with ethics and complex challenges is my greatest joy in role-playing games. I see the colonization-theme as both challenging, and very promising. I'm glad to have had this thread inspiring it.

The publishing houses who put out fantasy novels want to go with what they believe will draw their biggest audience, and 99 percent of the time, that's European/Tolkien-style fantasy. She'd said that she once wrote a very detailed, dramatic novel set in a fantasy analogue of Egypt. After reading it, the publisher said, "This story is great, but the one thing we'd like you to change is the setting - we need it to be something more like medieval Europe."<br/><br/>So, after a week or so of being upset about it, since she needed to put food on the table, she went ahead and reskinned the story as something with a more Norse/medieval flavor; and they published it.<br/><br/>Of course, the publishing business is going through a LOT of changes now, so maybe the "face of fantasy" is changing as well. We'll have to see what happens.</blockquote>\nThat's not so true with the smaller 3pps - niche is the way to go for small publishing houses and standard fare medievil D&amp;D is not as easy to market when that's the market for the big publishers: WotC, Paizo, Fantasy Flight, etc. Just looking at Pathfinder - since that's the RPG market that I work in, the leading small publishers include Open Design, 4 Winds, Super Genius Games, and Rite Publishing all specialize in a much more niche type product.<br/><br/>I work closely with Rite Publishing and looking at all their productlines, they have: Kaidan - feudal Japanese horror (niche), Jade Oath - wuxia (niche), Questhaven - which is somewhat standard fare but the primary PC races include minotaurs, gargoyles, wyrd (giants, half elf/half ogre magi), fey shapechangers (all very much niche), they have steampunk settings, post apocalypse, and several others, but none of which fits as standard Euro-analog nor very Tolkienesque.<br/><br/>The truth is there are markets for the niche settings, but they are all too small for larger publishing houses. The small 3pp can 'own their niche' and become vary successful targetting a small, specific market. Trying to compete against Paizo and WotC for the Tolkienesque settings is an impossible and very expensive task for the small companies. So the idea that the bulk of RPG publishers only work with Tolkienesque worlds is abjectly wrong. At least it is in my experience and I'm a small 3PP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340829/#Comment_340829" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T10:26:26+00:00" title="August 29, 2011 10:26AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sanglorian, I'm late to the party, but here's my thoughts.  I suspect a lot of this comes down to the age group of the typical RPG audience.<br/><br/>1. Ethnically homogeneous, stereotyped civilizations are easy for a 12 year-old (who doesn't give a crap about history or politics) to understand.  Often, these nations are really just there to provide some plausible origin to particular character concepts, so why bother giving them interesting dynamics?  Usually, the adventure is only nominally occurring anywhere in particular: even if it's set in the land of the elves, you're learning little more about the dynamics of elven culture than you are about what sorts of random monsters you're likely to meet in the woods.<br/><br/>Clear-the-dungeon role-playing games and video games alike need a steady stream of easily recognizable 'bad guys'.  Client states, immigration, colonization are all social/political issues, which don't serve this need; these are situations that let more mature players tangle with concepts that they find interesting, now that they've taken that history minor and have felt the sting of workplace politics, struggled with the subtlety and difficulty of real relationships.<br/><br/>The more politically charged games take more sophistication to breathe life into. For a somewhat static fantasy realm, all you need is a folio of monsters and some concept art to get you going.  Ancient, abandoned locations are just exotic sets upon which to stage the battles.  Compared to this, Saxons slowly pushing out the Britons (what, everybody's human?) just sounds so bloody dreary!<br/><br/>2. Social and political problems haven't had much mechanical support (until recently; my first experience of it being BW).  Imagine an accomplished hero who is somehow yet cowed by his overbearing (but non-combatant) mother.  Looked at through an old school D&amp;D lens, this sounds like a 10th level Fighter being somehow intimidated by a 0-level peasant - which is unintentionally comical. He kills owlbears, for chrissakes!  But as we come to appreciate the ways that social pressure acts through the ubiquitous net of relationships that holds each of us in our place, it makes a lot more sense.<br/><br/>Without this support, few GMs could muster enough verisimilitude to get a party of adventuring bad-asses to feel that the disapproval of the local mayor means anything at all.  "We'll just kick his ass!"<br/><br/>3. To someone exposed mostly to caricatures of historical eras, colonialism just seems anachronistic to fantasy; evokes settlers struggling in log cabins rather than swords &amp; sorcery.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340839/#Comment_340839" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T12:18:48+00:00" title="August 29, 2011 12:18PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Fuseboy</cite>3.

Swords n Dragons n Wizards just seem wrong when I think of colonialism. <br/><br/>Of course, I also tend to not like fantasy ( of the swords and sorcery sort anyway) creeping into my later period based RPGs.

by Orson Scott Card, which is based on a fantasy version of America (1800 AD to the Civil War period).<br/><br/>Concepts like Benjamin Franklin being a wizard, Napoleon bearing a charm that makes him popular, Native American mythos and monsters. Even some Witch Trials from New England - to me all great fantasy concepts. Some even bear swords. Perhaps there is a dirth of dragons, but many traditional fantasy concepts can easily fit into a colonialism concept. It depends on the setting and GM I suppose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_342168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342168/#Comment_342168" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-10T15:53:49+00:00" title="September 10, 2011  3:53PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This week I will start up four campaigns with a mixed colonial/new world theme, in my classical frpg <i>Fabula</i>.
