                    This is a question that comes with a disclaimer. I hope to make my tone clear, but just to make extra sure: I don't want to bash anyone else's fun, and if I slip and do it anyway, and you point it out to me, I'll leap in with an apology and (I hope) a change of style to avoid doing it again.<br/><br/>Narrativism as a category doesn't interest me, and it's mostly because I'm not interested in the particular method of storytelling that rests at its heart. I can see others having fun with it and am glad they are, but for me, the format for Premise simply doesn't click with what I care about as a writer, co-storyteller, or audience in any reliable way. There are other models of what goes into a story that I find more engaging, illuminating, and just plain fun. (Disclaimer check: I hope that was clear, but not insulting. I'm certainly willing to treat my thing with Premise as a blind spot, at a minimum.)<br/><br/>I'm curious what efforts I might have missed in games intended to emphasize the collaborative narrative building <i>without</i> also including narrativist agenda? Or is this basically untilled land at the moment? Illumination welcome.                </div>

<br/>
If I'm correct, then I can only guess that you're mixing up some of the other aspects of the games that are being produced with narrativism.  But then, I could be wrong.  If I am, then I officially hate the jargon.  There.  I said it.  :p<br/>

                            Bruce, I think I need more information from you to offer anything in reply. <br/>
<br/>
Can you explain what you think is that "particular method of storytelling that rests at its heart"? I have no idea what you mean, and I especially have no idea what you don't like about it.<br/>
<br/>
That said, it seems to me  you're saying (in semi-Forge speak, which I recognize may not be your bag): You don't like Narrativism, you like Something Else. But, you figure there are lots of techniques Narrativist games use that you might appropriate for some awesome fun. What are they?<br/>
<br/>
That's actually a really good question, and I suspect there are many game play techniques you can use. But, I just don't know which ones you like, don't like, know about, don't know about and so on.<br/>
<br/>
So, you're likely to receive a shotgun blast of ideas, and that's cool. I'm not much of a shotgunner, though, and maybe some clarification or more specifics can help me load my 30-30.                        </div>

                            Narrativism seems to me set up to create a particular kind of story: built around a question that usually boils down to "What will you pay for this?" Which is a reasonable way to read a lot of stories, but not one that has any connection to how I wrote my novels, or to how a lot of other stories get made. I think here for instance of Stephen King's comment that "'This is what happened' is the mantra of all story", or Nancy Kress' that a successful story ends when the questions asked at the beginning have been answered - but the questions are not at all necessarily the kind of thing Egri or Edwards seem to have in mind as suitable themes.<br/>
<br/>
I have the impression that the construction of stories without Premise in that sense is treated as a matter of simulationism in the Forge model. Am I getting that right? I know I've gotten it wrong in the past. :) If I am, then the question would be usefully phrased in Forge terms, "Anything interesting happening with the simulation of existing fictional genres?"                        </div>

I'd like to hear about some examples of play you really liked; I think that's the best way to get at what you're looking for. What were some of the moments in your RP history when you had the most fun, or were the most impacted by the play events, etc.? What did the players do to make that come about, and how did the system you were using help or hinder it? From there, we can head to Eric's challenge: how do we create a system that helps to have those moments more often and more reliably?<br/>

                            Ben: Lots of things can be cool to me about a story. Let me think about the ones I've enjoyed recently...<br/><br/>Currently I've got an unabridged reading of Elizabeth Kostova's <i>The Historian</i> going here. This is a modern gothic, basically, with plot threads in the modern day, the 1950s, and the 1930s all dealing with scholars unraveling parts of Count Dracula's secrets. The audiobook does a particularly nifty thing: the primary narrator is female, and the chapters in her voice have a female narrator. But there are also chapters that are manuscripts written by her father, and by his advisor, and a man reads those. This is a conceit obviously familiar to folks who've been playing shared-narration games a lot in recent years, I just wanted to note it as done particularly well in that other medium. Back to the question.<br/><br/>The middle part is a bit limp, but I really enjoyed Stephen King's <i>Cell</i> just recently. The characters were reasonably engaging, but what most caught me was the continuing changes in the world. Rather than a single apocalyptic moment, there's one damn thing after another, requiring continuing changes in everyone's responses. King has done this before, on scales both epic (<i>The Stand</i>) and personal (<i>From a Buick 8</i>), and I particularly like it when it's coupled with an emphasis on dealing with mysteries you can't solve. It feels, and I make no claim other than "it feels to me", like that combination has a particular metaphorical weight, more true to the kind of mess chronic disability puts me in. So there's an extra deep satisfaction in it.<br/><br/>I have a deep fondness in general too for stories that turn out not to be what they look to be about, and yet satisfy Kress' observation about answering the questions at the start. Mark Danielewski's <i>House of Leaves</i>, which I just re-read as mood for an upcoming World of Darkness chronicle, comes to mind here. The "truth" of the story is hidden layers deep, and sorting through the layers of cover is part of the fun. I'm also reminded of the way John Le Carre opens most of his stories with the perspective of someone who'll be irrelevant to most of it, and pulls you in through layers of characters to the heart of it.<br/><br/>There's more - darned good question, Ben - but I've got to go hassle some chores.                        </div>

                            Bruce, I do not think you are getting it right. I say that because I think you've got a characiture in your mind of what Narrativist games must be like. <br/>
<br/>
You declare a difference between some too-formal structure that is Lajos Egri's Premise and Nancy Kress' "are the questions answered?" I see ZERO difference between those two things. Nancy Kress, as you've attributed here, just defined exactly Narrativism in my book.<br/>
<br/>
For example, when I get people playing NIne Worlds, I don't get all high and mighty about authority structures and independence, which is part of what that game's Premise is. Instead, I have them make neat characters with all these cool goals. I instruct them how to set these goals up (Like, "Become the King of New Sparta" or "Cure the Solar Plague and save my infected brother") and then let them go to work. <br/>
<br/>
So, the questions are something like "Can I become the king of New Sparta? Do I have what it takes? Will they like me?" or "What happens if I don't cure the Solar Plague? Will bro' die?"<br/>
<br/>
And, frankly, I have no idea where you're getting the idea that this is not what Ron has in mind. More importantly, I don't care. I know enough about both Ron and Narrativism to say this is what *I* have in mind for Narrativism, and I know Ron agrees with me about much of it. (shrug)<br/>
<br/>
What did you think about my distinction between agendas and techniques? Is that what you're after? Techniques for your different non-Narrativist agenda?<br/>
<br/>
For example, one technique I like to use recently is letting each player set a scene in turn. Just go around the table and each person gets to say "Ok, I want a scene with my character and that creep from two sessions ago -- in the airlock!" <br/>
<br/>
This technique can work with most any group or style of play, really. It's great for letting people have some story input.                        </div>

                            There's a reason I'm not designing the kind of game I'm looking for right now, by the way: I'm sicker than I usually am. At the best of times, I have maybe 25-35% the energy and metabolic efficiency of a healthy adult. In bad times, it drops down to more like 10%, thanks to interlocking immune, endocrine, and other problems. I am currently mending from such a bad time. I'm six months behind on work and struggling rather hard not to blow the rest of my contracts from last year. I simply can't make a new game for this purpose and do the stuff I'm already committed to. That's why I'm asking.<br/>
<br/>
Not to be a putz about it, but I think that some of these forums can easily overlook the role of real-life constraints. this is mine.                        </div>

<p>It's not a 40-hour a week job to create a game.  No one asked you to do that.  I dropped the important notes to my current design in about 4-6 hours of downtime between flights one day.  If you can't find that small amount of time, then I aplogise; I did indeed overlook your real-world constraints.</p>

                            Matt, I'm not so much interested in specific techniques as, say, a game designed very thoroughly to work like a latter-day noir story - something that, if we played it "by the book" would produce results reminiscent of Ellroy or Connelly or some such.

Heh. I like your enthusiasm, Eric, but I'm not sure that everyone here has enough time to "find something lacking" then make the jump to "creating the game to address what they find lacking". I don't even know if I have the time to <i>discuss</i> solitions to what I find lacking about this or that experience. :-)<br/><br/>Bruce, I'd like to readress your "topic question" here, again by yanking out the GNS teeth (I'm not really sure they apply here):
<blockquote>I'm curious what efforts I might have missed in games intended to emphasize the collaborative narrative building without also including <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">narrativist</span> SOME WERID-ASS agenda? </blockquote>
(note: SOME WEIRD-ASS is perfectly acceptable terms to me to signify the "X" in this equation we're tryign to fill, it's not a rib on any game or anything).<br/><br/>So, you got Ben's question about Stories answered.  Are you then looking for games that might address those types of experience of the novels that you list above?<br/><br/>That's the first question I had.<br/><br/>The second one is what Matt S asked above, just so we know what is and isn't cool in your book (to help you find those games).  So, Nar and other Forgie-terms aside, what are you trying to step away from? It sounds like you're trying to step away from games that focus only on one kind of story (ie Sorcerer, MLWM, etc). Is that correct? If so, what would you like to see in its place ?(if not, ignore this question)<br/><br/>Finally, question three: Are there any games that exist out there right now that do what you're looking for, above?  We might be able to use those examples to find other games...<br/><br/>Hope that helps!                        </div>

                            Andy: Hey, useful questions. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Pendragon comes immediately to mind as a game whose sessions and campaigns feel like their source material to me. I'd like something that made me equally happy for modern noir, George Martin-esque gritty "post-high" fantasy (but it has to have a fairly simple combat system, which lets out the obvious contenders like Burning Wheel and Riddle of Steel), or gothic. Or smething else like that that I'm not thinking of right now.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to step away from games that do just one thing, and from games that make it hard for players to sustain immersive engagement with their characters.                        </div>

There we go.  We got to the Question buried in there.  Very interesting one, at that.  Hmmmm, lemme think about that.  Well, obviously, nothing is coming to mind, so I'd say "No, no such game currently exists". However, having said that, I guess the next set of questions is:<br/><br/>What would such a game look like? <br/><br/>What would its structure look like?<br/><br/>What kinds of special rules may it have?                        </div>

                            To be honest, I haven't a damn clue what the sort of game I'm looking for would look like. Pendragon surprised me. I'd expect the noir or gritty/high fantasy or gothic game to be equally surprising.

                            As usual, Matt's right: this is a Technical question, not a GNS issue.<br/><br/>But, more importantly, GNS is distracting here. It's diagnostic, not prescriptive, so let's make something that fits your specs and if we want we can find the CA for it later.
<blockquote> stories that turn out not to be what they look to be about... The "truth" of the story is hidden layers deep, and sorting through the layers of cover is part of the fun. I'm also reminded of the way John Le Carre opens most of his stories with the perspective of someone who'll be irrelevant to most of it, and pulls you in through layers of characters to the heart of it.</blockquote>
That's some pretty cool game spec there.<br/><br/>The John LeCarre idea, unsurprisingly, reminds me of Spione, Ron Edwards' game in process. In it, the protagonists of the story can only be determined in retrospect, so you're likely to start with a secondary character appearing centrally.
<blockquote> what most caught me was the continuing changes in the world... there's one damn thing after another, requiring continuing changes in everyone's responses. King has done this before, on scales both epic (The Stand) and personal (From a Buick 8), and I particularly like it when it's coupled with an emphasis on dealing with mysteries you can't solve.</blockquote>
Very interesting. You could certainly deal with this using a Dogs in the Vineyard hack. There's been much talk of a Dark Tower setting with the game, where the world's moved on and you're Gunslingers trying to slow the inevitable collapse of reality by combatting its symptoms.                        </div>

                            Oh, one thought about Unknown Armies...<br/>
<br/>
It provides excellent support for noir ambience, but then not for noir plots. This is part of what makes me think of Pendragon: the story of rising and falling virtue and of fathers, sons, and grandsons is very much the stuff of the romances. A Pendragon writeup is likely to resonate as a pretty decent romance. A game with a noir structure would have the opening crime, the apparently unrelated case that connects later, the trusted betrayer, the false solution, the painful truth, and so on. Ron hit on a bunch of that in Sex &amp; Sorcerer - I'm not trying to be unique here, just reflecting out loud.<br/>
<br/>
So I'm interested in any games that might have that quality as well.<br/>
<br/>
(I do note that a campaign built around the characters' moral health can have a fair amount of htis quality. "This is the story of how Blackie broke.")                        </div>

                            Bruce: Yeah, honestly, after reading what you liked about those novels (The Historian, Cell, House of Leaves), and how they all approach the story-makng process a little differently each (through changes in narration, flashbacks, bang-bang-bang-Bangs, and layers-of-depth)... I'm thinking that, maybe a game would have to be created that addresses each individually.  Like, three games, one to simulate each of those story environments (well, maybe two: Layers-of-Depth can probably be rolled into one of the other two).<br/><br/>So, currently, no, no game exists that can do the first two novels above within the rules themselves, though Edwards' upcoming Spione seems to address that first one VERY well (though I haven't been too deep into it yet). <br/><br/>So, unless we sit and wait for someone out there to wrap the above into a game, I'm thinking we can use other tools.  That is, instead of Full Games, we can try Techniques that we can apply to Already Existing Games.  Techniques are meta-rules that are applicable to almost any (traditionally-oriented) game, from Nine Worlds to Dead Inside to Dungeons and Dragons. <br/><br/>So we can maybe try to think of some techniques that we can apply to, say, Unknown Armies, to be able to Change Narrator of Events, Set up scenes through Flashbacks, creating a scenario style of One-Bang-After-Another, or a mystery style that has plots within plots, or the Noir narrative/story structure.  Would you like to try to go down that road?<br/><br/>=====<br/><br/>Now, some quick personal experience: One player in my other-wednesday group often uses flashbacks in his games. Like, we'll be playing a scene, and then have a flashback to the previous day or a few hours ago, back and forth.  It seemed cool at the time, but in the end, without rules, and especially without any formalized technique, the whole process was a little jarring and not as cool as it could have been.  When rules don't exist, I like to aim at making universally-applicable techniques to improve play.                        </div>

                            I've had a few very good experiences with flashbacks, most particularly the series of recovered memories in the terminal Wraith adventure. Playtesting that was one of the most intense gaming experiences I've ever had. <br/>
<br/>
Sure, talking about techniques seems worthwhile to me. It occurs to me that in noir some of it is the willingness of the protagonists to pursue a suspect before the evidence quite clicks - and sometimes they're right, and sometimes not. The trick there is to make players feel confident about doing it, and to make sure the GM doesn't screw the players over for doing so, whatever happens to the characters. <br/>
<br/>
Like that?<br/>

                            Bruce, all this talk about noir makes it impossible for me to stay away.<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently making efforts to write a game that should follow the narratives of 50s film noir. It's called One Can Have Her and started as a 24hour game, but I've rebuilt it twice since then. Right now I'm dying to playtest the latest version, but can't find the time. Perhaps you're looking for something already published, and then I'll disappoint you.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the thing that got me started was the endings of most noirs, where either everyone dies or maybe someone survives by doing some pretty questionable stuff. I'm using the prisoner's dilemma for this, and during endgame each player gets to choose if their character will rat on the others or not. If you're ratting, but no one else does, you get to decide what happens to your character and the femme fatale as an epilogue, while everyone else dies or goes to jail. If more than one character rats, everyone dies. If no one does, no one gets the girl, but instead continue some mediocre existence.<br/>
<br/>
That's a game mechanic for emulating part of a narrative structure, I would think. Another thing I've got is that each character has aspects (which can be anything from skills to belongings or personality traits) that are connected to "moral" values (you can have the aspect "boxing" connected to "physical health".) I don't know if "health" would be a <i>moral</i> value, so perhaps I need a better term. Anyway, each value can be "high" or "low".<br/>
<br/>
When you enter a conflict you have to use an aspect, but can activate more to get an advantage at the die roll. After the conflict, at least one of the corresponding values you've used has to switch from high to low or vice versa. That means that you can have a high physical health, go boxing and lower it to "low", or the other way around. This gives the player a chance to say what the previous scene and conflict actually <i>meant</i>, story-wise. Perhaps the beating was what the guy needed to sober up and get a grip, so physical health goes "high", for example.<br/>
<br/>
I started thinking about this after reading Robert McKee's book Story. He says that the only reason to include a scene in a movie script is to show a value switching polarity, otherwise it should be cut. We don't want to see the romantic couple having a high love, and then another scene with high love, followed by another scene with high love. But if we change the middle scene to a low-love scene, perhaps they're fighting, suddenly the story's a lot more interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the character sheets look really neat after you've filled out what happens to the values in different scenes, with zigzagging values all across them. Makes it easy to see where the action has been.<br/>
<br/>
Is it something like that you're looking for, Bruce?                        </div>

<em>Narrativism seems to me set up to create a particular kind of story: built around a question that usually boils down to "What will you pay for this?"</em><br><br>This is an unfortunate oversimplification of another common oversimplification "play that focuses on tough moral choices."  There's lots of other opportunities out there that don't revolve around reframing our anxiety over making paychecks cover bills.                        </br></br></div>

                            Jonas, the prisoner's-dilemma approach to climax sounds perfect.

                            First I'd like to say ... Woot!  Bruce!<br><br>Second, I'd like to say that I've read <i>Cell</i> recently as well (I liked it right up to the part where it started to look like <i>Tommyknockers Redux</i>) - and I get what you mean about the world - we'll address that in a second.<br><br>Thirdly, I'm currently still playing out a game of <i>De Profundis</i> which is inspired by <i>House of Leaves</i>.  If you're not familiar, <i>DePro</i> is essentially a play-by-mail RPG, where the players engage in two narratives simultaneously - one narrative as characters in the present day (our current game has the players playing themselves), and one narrative taking place in the past (ours takes place in the 1970s).  Players exchange letters which are coded for clarity, where we blend our real lives with this research into a series of strange cult films from the 70s which, as the narrative unfolds, appear to have <i>real, actual</i> supernatural events spliced into them as 'effects shots'.  <br><br>So one narrative thread is: we have two academics in universities across the country from each other in the mid-eighties who are researching these films and exchanging letters about their finds.  The other narrative thread is: my friends and I discovering not just the original films, but the works of these two academics and the strangeness (and untimely, mysterious demise) that eventually befell them, and recently the <i>strangeness befalling us</i>.  <br><br>So you can see where <i>House of Leaves</i> plays into this.<br/><br/>We have a bit of an odd system, in that we're doing it up like an alternate-reality game like <i>I Love Bees</i> - fake (or real) web pages, bonus points for finding weird clips that eerily tie in with our concept of these movies on YouTube and other video outlets ... stuff like that.  We leave odd messages on each others' answering machines and send spoofed e-mails.  It's a hoot.<br/><br/>And lord knows I'm always willing to fire up another game of <i>De Profundis</i> (which was originally written for the Cthulhu mythos, btw).<br/><br/>Those things aside - I think you're looking for something to integrate on top of the current games that you like that can help facilitate the kinds of story-stuff you want to generate in your roleplaying games.  So it'd help if we knew what you were playing or what you'd want to modify.<br/><br/>But off the top of my head, using <i>Cell</i> as an example ... the thing that I liked (and you liked) was that the situation was a character.  The Pulse and its aftermath evolved and changed.  So what you're looking for is some way to integrate dynamic situation easily (and structurally) into your games.  I'm not sure *exactly* how you'd do that - but just sitting here spitballing, I'll throw out 'The World has a character sheet too.'  Give the world some variables, have the players or GM roll at certain trigger-events (a failure, fr'ex), and the situation changes.<br/><br/>Hm - interesting.  I realized I just got back to <i>Pox</i>.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>But let us know what you're currently into, and maybe I can find a way to make it even better.<br/><br/>Oh, and what Andy calls techniques, I'd go a step further and call meta-mechanics.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Well, at the moment I'm firing up an nWoD chronicle in Seattle, and have my stuff for it pretty well in place - but I'd be delighted to find additional support for the noir side, and for the Keel-style mystery weirdness. Eventually I'll probably want some support for when the Russian Ventrue prince mounts his glorious crusade to restore the empire back home, for Martin Cruz Smith-flavored "you are doomed" social interaction. But that comes later.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of the world having a character sheet. I realize that I could do up clan and covenant character sheets, drawing on the community rules Geoff Skellams and I did for d20 Gamma World, and sheets for the non-vampire resources around them. (I'm ashamed. I should have thought of this earlier. I've been sick.)<br/>
<br/>
I'm continuing to mull stand-off rules. I know I want 'em. :) I've also been thinking of poking at Chris Aylott's wonderful Dynasties &amp; Demagogues supplement for D&amp;D to see about a rhetorical-strategies enhancement of social interaction.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm. Might even pass those to folks to play in sessions when their characters aren't involved. <br/>
<br/>
But I should note that I'm also kind of casting around for neat stuff in genres I'm not running right now.                        </div>
