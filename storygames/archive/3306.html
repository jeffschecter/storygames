I decided to take what ideas I had contributed and what inspiration I had gotten andmake my own version according to my own vision. The other participants agreed, and we parted on good terms (the project appears to have gone belly up, as with so many other rpgs started as collaborative efforts in threads on RPGnet).<br/><br/>Heres the idea:<br/><br/>A group of people in a land of wild forests and melancholic beauty have been hurt by an Enemy,and are seeking revenge. This Enemy is a horrible, evil figure,and opposing hi/her/it is the only right thing to do.<br/>These people areforced to travel through wild, untamed nature and wildernessto reach their Enemy. On the way they share stories of their lives around the campfire to amuse themselves and pass the time, and through these tales the relationships between them are revealed. Their lives are all connected,somein more obvious ways than others, but these relationships are all significant. They are the basis of the Trust between them, and sometimes their Trust is shaken to the core around the campfire..<br/><br/>In the wilderness, this Trust is tested. The group is forced to help one another through dangerous situations in the wilds, and their Trust is the only thing that can save them.<br/><br/>Finally they reach their Enemy, and there is a battle. If their Trust is strong, and they fillout each others weaknesses and help each other, then they stand a chance defeat the Enemy. If not.. You get the idea.<br/><br/>Before the game starts, the players create the Enemy. The characters start out as blank pages, and gradually get more detailedasplay progresses. Character creation happens in play, in other words. During Campfire scenes, players take turns telling a story about their character, in which they weave their character into the stories of the other players or that of the Enemy. Based on this story and the connections they make to other elements of the game, they get Traits that will become useful in both Wildernes scenes and the final fight against the Enemy. <br/>I want it to be beneficial to create intrigue between characters in the Campfire scenes, to put their Trust on the line. There should be two choices: one selfish choice that creates intrigue (weaving your character into another characters story), and one altruistic choice that strengthens everyone but also benefits the Enemy in the final fight (weaving your character into the Enemys backstory).<br/><br/>Campfire scenes should be very freeform, and consist entirely or almost entirely of storytelling. Maybe I will use key phrase mechanics similiar to Polars.<br/><br/>Wilderness scenes are the characters againt the enviromnent. Wether "the enviromnent" constitutes bandits, a fallen log in the road, a gorge to cross or roaming monsters is all the same. The characters are put in dangerous situations where their Trust is put to the test. Only by trusting one another can they succeed and overcome the opposition.<br/>In these scenes Traits are used, dice are rolled and so on. Less freeform than Campfire scenes, but not as tactical as the final fight.Maybe something along the lines of SotC. Trust is the most important thing here.<br/><br/>FInally, one night, it is time to face the Enemy. How this is decided is uncertain.Maybe one player simply needs to say "Tomorrow we face the Enemy" instead of telling a story. Maybe theres a mechanical end condition, a rating that is maxed out or a pool that is filled or something. Either way, the end game is a tacticalfight, with lots of options. Something like a traditional combat system, or maybe like scripted combat in Burning Wheel (Im using a lot of comparisons here, but what Im after is the feel of the mechanics, not a copy).<br/>This fight needs to be huge, epic and cinematic, a counterpoint to the melancholy of the Campfire scenes and the Wilderness scenes. I want the playersto feelexcited at the thought of finally facing the enemy they have been statting out and telling stories about for the entire game. And I want it to be tactical.<br/><br/>Those are my goals and ideas, but I havent got a clue where to proceed from there. The mechanics need to interact in ery specific ways (Traits having different functions in the various stages of the game, for example), and Imstumped for ideas.<br/><br/>Does anyone have any tips? Any ideas that you feel like sharing, that could possibly help me get started?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74898/#Comment_74898" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-11T08:48:54+00:00" title="June 11, 2007  8:48AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds like a fun game.

I can't tell you general working method only what I would do.<br/><br/>Let's have a look at the structure first to be sure, I understand right:<br/><br/>An adventure consists of days spent in the wilderness. Every evening there is/are campfire story/ies and every day there is/are wilderness encounters. On the last day there is the encounter with the Evil.<br/><br/>These should be rewarded:<br/>- telling a story<br/>- successful intrigue<br/>- successful resolution of wilderness encounter<br/>- successful resolution of encounter with Evil<br/><br/>These should be punished:<br/>- someone else's successful intrigue<br/>- unsuccessful reso of encounter<br/>- unsuccessful reso of enc with Evil<br/><br/>The simplest reward could be an "attribute", or a better term would be Feat ala D&amp;D. But it can be anything from equipment ("Do you know why I carry this knife with me all the time?") to knowledge. If someone tells a story, the player can manifest something on the character sheet. This can work as simple like that.<br/><br/>What can be intrigue? I would make sure that there are as many days as players are, and every evening another one of them tells a story. After the first story I would ask the other players if they want to continue it or correct it. I would make a mechanic that differenciates continuing, correcting, filling in the gaps of the story, etc. For example correcting could negate the manifested item but giving another to the PC who corrects it. Filling in the gaps would manifest another item to the filler and the teller. And if someone continues, the PC could manifest one item extra. (And by item I mean attributes, feats, skills, etc.)<br/><br/>I think if you use real trust among players, you won't have to use a Trust value. (As it should be the fruitful void.)<br/><br/>Well, this is how I would begin designing it. I hope it was useful.<br/><br/>Gabor                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74975/#Comment_74975" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-11T14:49:11+00:00" title="June 11, 2007  2:49PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Cold City is available in print and PDF; and there are various reviews floating about.<br/><br/>It's Berlin, 1950.
