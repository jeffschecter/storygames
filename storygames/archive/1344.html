                    What I am posting here is a  sanity check on what I've been thinking about and fishing for some outside ideas. Headings or double spacing indicates a change in focus.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some assumptions out of the way:<br/>
Authority is defined as who can say where the buck stops and having legitimacy to that decision. Authority can be split by requiring consensus/majority in a decision.<br/>
Power is like authority but lacks legitimacy in making a decision. Power can  influences authority.<br/>
Authority is really just the person with the most power in a situation or area.<br/>
A power struggle is an attempting to overrule, change, or make a decision without a clear authority.<br/>
What counts as a valid source of authority or power for a group depends on the group and their purpose.<br/>
Authority also has certain responsibilities and failure to meet those responsibilities erodes all authority held by that player.<br/>
Everyone is a player but someone could be a GM.<br/>
<br/>
Shared authority and power should not be confused. With shared authority some consensus must be reached but with authority and power the power can be stopped by the authority at any time.<br/>
<br/>
Universalis's coins are an example of a power that leads to a power struggle (Bidding) to become the authority in a controlled fashion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Power levels may be ranked by the player with authority, then the players with varying degrees of power behind that. An actual ranking of power is difficult since it is more fluid in its changes then authority is.<br/>
<br/>
It is common for a player to be the authority of his character and the Gm the authority of his actions.<br/>
It is also not uncommon for an power to make most of the decision but to default to an Authority in a power struggle. When a GM fudges die rolls he is the authority but  he abides by the dice (a power) most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sources of Power<br/>
The most common sources of power are things that already have authority or power.<br/>
In RPGs this leads to rules books, players with the most experience, and dice rolls to being common sources of authority. Books gain authority from an agreement by the players to follow them. Dice or other mechanics gain authority from the rule book. Players tend to gain authority from past authority experiences (Being or having been GM, more play time, have read more of the book, age, past interactions).<br/>
Arbitrary or self selecting authorities in are more subject to power struggles and replacement from the power struggle then authorities that have been established by other sources of authority. Some sort of power struggle is guaranteed when a group meets for the first time or dramticaly changes activities.<br/>
<br/>
Changing the rules of the game is an example of replacing the self selecting authority of the rule book.<br/>
<br/>
GM tasks are one way to divide authority but it can be further divided by what in the RPG experience as a whole a particular player is given authority over.                </div>

                            Examples<br/>
A Use of Established Authority to Create a New Stronger Authority<br/>
Often in my games a power struggle would result when the player did not think the GM made the right call in a situation. These would be lengthy and common part of a play session. Most of the players did not think the GM had enough power to enforce his authority and would start a power struggle to try and become the authority if only for that one decision. To solve this a rule was create to have authority whenever a player and the GM entered into such a power struggle.<br/>
The player picked high or low then the DM rolled a die. If the die came up then the high or low as the player predicted the power struggle resolved in their favor, otherwise in the GM's favor.<br/>
The power and past authority or player decisions (picking high or low), dice to resolve things (perceived fairness/lack of bias), and the GM's authority (to create system) were enough to become the authority in any power struggle or discussion of a bad call. The GM went from being a weak authority to a strong power with the Pick High/Low mechanic being the authority used to make a legitimate/binding decision even though the GM still made most of the decisions.<br/>
The end result was actual less instances that would otherwise have become power struggles rather then more. Also the Pick High/Low mechanic maintained its authority with all of the GMs in the group when they ran their games and expanded to become an authority on non-power struggle decisions as well.<br/>
<br/>
Authority with â€œSay yes or Roll the Diceâ€<br/>
Using Dogs in the Vineyard as the rule book.<br/>
A Dog creates some input into the game. At this point there is neither power nor authority.<br/>
The group is the authority that determines if the input is valid.<br/>
Once the input has been determined to be valid the input is then under the GM's authority to determine out come (Does the GM say yes or roll the dice?). <br/>
If its roll the dice the dice then become the authority on the outcome of that input with the character's traits and other dice  being a source of power for the player to influence the dice in authority.<br/>
This goes through a lot more stages of authority then in a traditional RPG where the GM or game rules can be the only authority acting on the input.                        </div>

                            I think you're on the right track, generally, and even using Power in very much the same way as it's been used in discussions like this before (though I think there were some slight differences). <br/><br/>I will definitely agree with your observation that when authority is clearly defined, no matter how it's defined, you tend to have less times when the authority is challenged. The Challenge rule in Universalis tends not to get used as much as some people expect that it might, and when it is, it's almost always to battle out some matter of color preference. Only very rarely does anyone use it to challenge a player on their use of the rules. <br/><br/>When you see that this is because everybody understands where the power comes from clearly, it all seems so obvious. <br/><br/>This is why, in many games where the GM is set as "final authority" on everything, appeals to plausibility become the players' only source of power and challenge to the GM authority. Basically the player is saying, "This isn't fun for me." To which the GM can simply reply, "Well, I'm the final authority." Which he'll do if he thinks that the player's real agenda is to find some loophole to "win." Like you say, this is why a clearly supported agenda is important, because without it, you have authority being used in a way that makes the game less interesting to some participants. This is also why in-game arguments about plausibility are so bad at resolving such issues, because they don't reveal agenda at all. <br/><br/>This is the single most common problem in RPG play, I believe. Everybody has seen it. The most common solution is, again, to make the GM the absolute authority. But that rarely satisfies everybody at the table. With the sample method you mention, the GM is informed that he has to bend to the player will at times, and so probably is looking to play to their agendas. And the players realize that he must, and so distrust the GM less. Hence the lesser number of problems. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>
