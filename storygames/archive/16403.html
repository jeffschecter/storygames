I just threw together a game hacked from several different systems for a quick pick-up Avengers game for some friends before the movie comes out. And I'm sorta proud of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the character sheets I made up! Please remember I have no skill with graphic design or layout. I just put this together in old Microsoft Word! What I am happy about is that the entire character sheet fits on an index card. In fact, if you cut out the picture, the info fits on a post-it note! This is a double-edged sword because while all the info you need is readily available, its rather small.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal was to make a very quick pick up game. Pre-Gen characters, very simple rules. This is why I didn't want to use Marvel Super Heroes or other games.<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/91566921                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374760/#Comment_374760" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T13:41:32+00:00" title="April 27, 2012  1:41PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, the character sheets are intriguing.

Again, not a layout professional. It comes in at a whopping 3 micro-pages (2 inch border all around, tried to imitate Pocket Danger Patrol without success).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this is pretty much Pocket Danger Patrol and Lady Blackbird hacked together with a dash of FATE and Mouse Guard. Maybe some inspirations from other sources.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rules are actually for a generic game. The first page is character creation. The second two are rules. <br/>\n<br/>\nI enjoy how Lady Blackbird moves characters from obstacle to obstacle with a ton of freeform play in between. However, I wanted to draw out the obstacles a little bit, so made each obstacle a full fledged encounter ala Danger Patrol. Instead of obstacle to obstacle, characters move from objective to objective. Sort of like in Lady Blackbird: Escape the Brig, Reclaim the Owl, Escape the Hand of Sorrow, Refuel, Get information on how to get to Remnants, Get Lady B to her man so she can do what she has to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlong with that we have characters with Goals, Relationships, and other flags for more in depth roleplaying. All this with the intense action sequences of Danger Patrol.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I hacked out the threat dice and replaced with the stress track from Fate and Conditions reminiscent of LB or Mouse Guard. I've played Pocket DP a few times in the past couple of weeks (what can I say, when I found out about it, I called everyone I knew!) but felt threat dice are just a bit too random, especially for the feel of game I'm aiming for.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLink to Rules:<br/>\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/91597371/Home-Brew                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
