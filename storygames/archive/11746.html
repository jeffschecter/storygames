I often think about the importance of gaming, and its importance in my life, and how that intersects with the importance of spirituality in my life.

As long as we can discuss this respectfully and without hard feelings...<br><br><br>I was brought up in an atheist household. Over the years I'd say the closest I was to declaring a particular spirituality when I was a teenager and claimed a pantheist worldview. These days I'd simply say I'm agnostic, but that term is (like any other related to faith and religion) very much charged with interpretations and muddled. I've always been interested in religion, myth, spirituality, but never felt the need to get involved in one. I've found all spiritual systems...lacking. I've found all religions flawed, as human institutions always are. If anything, I'd say I believe in a personal religion and an impersonal god, in a Spinosean sense, but I keep my distance at all times. I don't specifically <i>believe</i> anything, especially in regards to traditional metaphysics, because I find myself unable to do so. I do find the subjects very fascinating however, I've read more Bible than any of my "religious" acquaintances and friends that actually went to Sunday school.<br><br/>As for gaming, what has always bothered me in settings like D&amp;D is how there really cannot be any interesting questions of faith and religion there. The gods are present, they give power to their priests, they can be killed. They're basically just supermen, not gods, and I find that boring and irritable sometimes. I think very few games address the question of <i>Faith</i> very well, except Dogs maybe, in its own way.<br/><br/>Ah, also, my ever-delayed game concerns itself with a world in which mankind arose to kill the gods...but that's just the beginning.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262169/#Comment_262169" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T01:50:16+00:00" title="March 16, 2010  1:50AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an atheist, but one with a strong interest in belief, I'm happy to play any shade of religious character or any shade of religion without worrying whether it offends my spiritual beliefs (of which I have none).

Tearing up my DMG felt <i>harsh</i> at the time, but it served us right for playing in the library I guess. Playing Shadowrun was okay though evidently - yah - so that's what we turned to playing instead.<br/><br/>I mainly play with atheists or weak-as-dishwater Christians who have religion but no faith. Like oreso, I have found playing Dogs in the Vineyard... interesting, in that the folks I have played with have either largely ignored any slightly more than superficial examination of faith and duty or have interpreted it as <i>"hey we're religious and therefore psycho nutjobs, so let's burn everyone, right after we've shot them, buggered them, and hung them."</i> I find the dismissive attitude amongst the sample folks I play with mildly perturbing - "are you really gonna do that?" is a common bleat from me in response to yet another depiction of psychotic behaviour. Not judging in Dogs is damn hard when you come from a judgemental background and are playing with atheists who really have nothing but media-inspired bad press about Christianity (and other religions too I daresay) to draw from.<br/><br/><i>::looks down at baggage::</i> Oh!

Maybe not leftist in the European sense, but very much liberal and anti-conservative. This sort of thing is difficult to gauge, though, as the reigning presumption easily causes bias when people want to make social situations go easily: it might well be that some of the gamers I know are Christian, for instance, but I just never know about it because the very assumption in our godless Nordic society is that everybody communicates like the humanist majority. I could conceivably play games with a guy for years without ever finding out that he's got faith, as he's grown used to just not taking it up outside the church crowd. The Wiccans and Satanists and Asatru and such are somewhat easier to spot, perhaps because they want to be seen and want to talk about their faith.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262212/#Comment_262212" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T07:29:24+00:00" title="March 16, 2010  7:29AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>The Wiccans and Satanists and Asatru and such are somewhat easier to spot, perhaps because they want to be seen and want to talk about their faith.</blockquote>\nI see a lot of this.  People seem more open to discussions of non-trad belief systems and atheism though.  I only discuss when asked since it can be a conversation stopper.

This is a very important part of gaming for me.<br/><br/>In high school, D&amp;D was very much distrusted. We hid our gaming books in a hollow pillar in the library basement so we could play. I never thought there was anything wrong with playing D&amp;D, myself. The depiction of religion in D&amp;D always struck me as cardboard and stupid. The one exception to that rule was the Raven Queen 4E D&amp;D campaign than John Harper briefly ran. In that campaign we really engaged the potential in the D&amp;D setting. I like playing characters who have an extreme point of view. <br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard demonstrated to me that a game can approach religion in an interesting way. I ultimately wrote <a href="http://planet-thirteen.com/Principia.aspx" rel="nofollow">Principia</a> to express my own frustrations with religion in RPGs and to demonstrate one alternative.<br/><br/>Nowadays I might describe my religion as Science Fiction Roman Catholicism. I believe in the tenets of the Catholic Church, but I also put a great deal of faith in science and human reason. The two create a worthwhile tension.

In some ways, I feel my faith runs deeper than most Christians. In other ways, it is vastly shallower. I have spent quality time with Satanists (LeVey version) atheists and pagans of various stripes, and I believe that NO single faith has the monopoly on Truth. I believe there is an absolute Truth, and the sole purpose of existence is to seek it; Not to find, but to seek. I happen to believe that the conglomerate of Christian faiths have a bit bigger chunk of the Truth than other faiths (else, why would I classify myself as one?) but that we also have a chunk of self-deception and obfuscation that's bigger than it ought to be, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that morality and faith are divorced; A belief or lack of belief in a greater power shouldn't be the reason you do the right thing. You do the right thing because it IS the right thing. My faith shapes what I feel is right and wrong, but does not dictate it. There are things I believe are not wrong that my religion says are wrong, and there are things that I believe are wrong that my religion is well known for.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis shows up in my gaming in that I rarely like to represent real-world or pseudo-real-world faiths in a bad light. My Dog was a genuine believer, compassionate, fair-minded and convinced of the rightness of his cause. He acknowledged that the Faith was imperfect, but believed it was the best thing going. Hence, when he passed judgment, he did it without doubt, but not always without regret. When a sorcerer was to be executed, he spent the night prior praying with the sorcerer, trying to help her get right with the King before she died.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my younger years, I was uncomfortable playing devotees of fictional deities. Hence, I used the loophole in the D&amp;D; text that said a Paladin could be devoted to an ideal, rather than a deity. In time, this reluctance faded, but I still tend to play good guys completely straight.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the flip side, I like to explore the darker side of things, usually in solo ventures like video games et al. These are things I couldn't, wouldn't, ever do in real life because of what I believe, so I indulge in fictional context. I do those wrong things. I explore what it is to be dismissive or doubtful of greater powers. I find, however, that while I can play an actively evil character, I cannot recall ever playing a character devoted to an evil deity or devil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262264/#Comment_262264" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T09:31:08+00:00" title="March 16, 2010  9:31AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was confirmed as a Lutheran at age 14, but in Germany religion is mostly a cultural tradition rather than real faith.

Though for the sci fi geeks among you, I think the Minbari on Babylon 5 have a Hegelian spiritual view. <br><br>Lisa and I went to a Unitarian Universalist church for a while, but it didn't quite feel "warm" enough for us. Now we started going to a Unity church, and I find myself quite at home there. They accept all spiritual paths, all lifestyles, and any other kind of diversity while affirming a one-ness of all people.

Beyond that, I don't think I can make sweeping statements about how my faith and gaming interact.<br><br>I can mention a specific anecdote however. In the game I'm currently running, one of the characters started as a Native American converted to Christianity and living among the Protestants of colonial Boston. Of course there are lots of moral, ethical, religious and social issues that come with that kind of person, and they've come up somewhat during play. <br/><br/>The point where my own beliefs started to play a role was when this character's faith started to falter. The player really ran with playing his crisis of faith, dark night of the soul, whatever you want to call it. It was actually kind of excruciating for me, but in a very good way. I feel more connected to that character than many I've played myself, just because his struggles with faith seemed so personal to me.<br/><br/>Being the GM in this situation, with the ability to provide conclusive proof of his beliefs, was kind of interesting. I felt sad for this character losing his faith; a part of me wanted to just flat out give him proof of his beliefs but I couldn't do that without cheapening his faith.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262280/#Comment_262280" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T10:19:40+00:00" title="March 16, 2010 10:19AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2010 10:22AM by Cedric P.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am not really preoccupied by spirituality, but I often enjoy reading about the topic.

Went through a major spiritual crisis and ended up a secular humanist.<br/><br/>I try not to be one of those tedious jerks who thinks that just because they've quit something it's now their sworn duty to viciously attack anyone who still does that thing, but get a couple beers in me and talk to me about religion and phrases like "anti-human, life-hating slave cult" are likely to slip out with alarming frequency. I know a number of truly decent religious people and see the positive effects that their faiths have in their lives, but I have a hard time reconciling that with my firm belief that if left unchecked, religion will eventually destroy the human race. But then, when I was a Christian, I had a hard time with "love the sinner but hate the sin". <br/><br/>In my gaming, I use religion the way I use everything else: as a tool to create interesting conflict and satisfying drama. In my D&amp;D settings, I tend to put more emphasis on mortals acting on their beliefs rather than on the direct influence of the gods. Usually the gods are distant, difficult or impossible to communicate with. I ran a heavily religious themed D&amp;D campaign where the gods had walled themselves up in a sort of celestial prison after realizing they were hopelessly addicted to meddling in mortal affairs. A number of religions sprang up to explain what had happened to the gods; none of them agreed and none of them could prove they were right. When the PC cleric began to have mysterious visions of one of her religion's saints, she couldn't <i>know</i> if they were real or not, she could only act on faith. The player found it a lot more interesting than the typical D&amp;D approach to religion, where Pelor calls you on his divine cell phone to tell you where the next dungeon is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262318/#Comment_262318" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T12:24:53+00:00" title="March 16, 2010 12:24PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm culturally Christian, but raised in a super liberal Southern Baptist church that got kicked out of the SBC when I was in elementary or middle school for marrying gay folks. Consequently, they didn't really teach us much about our religious heritage in Sunday school because they were worried about indoctrinating us.  Most of the people in my church came from and rejected much more conservative upbringings, so they didn't want to pass that legacy onto their children.  I learned more about religion in college and in personal conversation than from church.<br/><br/>Personally, I don't believe Jesus was more divine than I am, but I'm vaguely Abrahamic in orientation, believing in a kind of the-universe-is-something-like-God panentheism of a perhaps Jeffersonian variety, but also being attracted to the idea of prophecy and that some people are more aware of spiritual aspects of life and the world than others, though I certainly don't claim to be one of them.  I'm a kind of anti-elitist in that sense, figuring that the people with claims to revelation are perhaps the least likely to have actually experienced it.<br/><br/>I've also spent a lot of time researching contemporary Chinese religion, though mostly through reading and not through personal experience, partially because it's still a relatively sensitive topic in a country that's still wrestling with its Marxist heritage and has minimal legal protection of religious rights.<br/><br/>In any event, I love having "realistic" religion in games and basically ignore the superficial D&amp;D cleric variety unless it's wedded to something more interesting.  I think Dogs in the Vineyard is fantastic as long as folks don't treat the Dogs as universally a band of crazy zealots, but use the game as an opportunity to explore different approaches to faith and practice.  I have this sneaking suspicion that Dogs is much more interesting with folks who have some degree of positive background in Abrahamic faiths, whether they still identify with any of those traditions or not, but obviously the game doesn't work for everybody.  If you can find something potentially good amidst all the historical problems and controversies of Christianity, I think that makes your play of Dogs more interesting or at least more complex.<br/><br/>Dogs was probably the first game about religion that I found really interesting and fulfilling.  I have a sense that How We Came to Live Here and Ganakagok can do similar things with non-Abrhamic traditions, but I haven't gotten to play either one yet.  Also, Thou Art But a Warrior seems pretty awesome.  I would still love to see a game that dealt with "popular religion" of the East Asian variety, the stuff that would eventually be formalized as Shinto in Japan but is active everywhere.  Or maybe something about Buddhism that actually got at some of the core beliefs and practices. That would be cool.<br/><br/>Since my personal beliefs are not especially restrictive as far as comfort with potential game content goes, I could totally play Poison'd all day long, but I've found that I'm less comfortable playing horribly immoral people mostly due to lack of practice.  It doesn't come naturally to me because I don't flex that muscle very often, not because I have certain moral or religious qualms about doing it, at least at the roleplaying table.<br/><br/>My personal beliefs and research background definitely draw me to settings and characters for whom "beliefs matter" and "culture matters."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262328/#Comment_262328" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T13:17:12+00:00" title="March 16, 2010  1:17PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2010 1:17PM by Bret_Gillan.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know how to answer this question.

I find certain arguments for God's existence remarkably (almost creepily) persuasive, but all public religions more or less equally repugnant. I don't know what that makes my "spirituality" - honestly that's a word that has never really found a place in my vocabulary.<br><br/>I was raised Catholic, and continued going to church quite a bit after I'd become aware that most of what my co-religionists believed was really pretty preposterous. The atmosphere of ritualized fellowship and sincere serious-mindedness always seemed to me to partly succeed in transcending the manifest silliness of most of what was being said, recited in unison, or sung. <br/><br/>Tabletop gaming is the only thing I've found that reproduces this very curious type of social atmosphere, and then only very rarely, when people are concentrating on the story for its own sake, rather than in order to just get laughs, beat up monsters, or level up their characters. Not that this latter stuff isn't also lots of fun, but there's something about the business of collaborative storytelling that has always seemed to me to make it an utterly distinctive type of human activity, the rewards of which are almost impossible to describe in any terms other than their own. I've actually come to think that maybe there's not a whole lot more to public religion than just the mute recognition of this fact, plus the curiously bizarre inference that because of it, the stories being told must somehow or other count as "true."                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262351/#Comment_262351" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T15:25:29+00:00" title="March 16, 2010  3:25PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2010 3:26PM by Wolfe.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark,<br/>\n<br/>\nYour talk of comparison between religious ritual and gaming brings up something I hadn't considered in my previous post.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experiences with a couple pagan communities in my early twenties really sparked my interest in ritual. I mean, if you'd asked about it in the right way, I'd have told you that yes, we had rituals in my hometown Baptist (as differentiated from Southern Baptist) churches growing up, but I'd never really thought about it in those terms before.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis fascination is mostly based on the power of symbols, be they words, phrases, implements or icons of significance. Hence, once I came to the Forge/indie community and I started hearing about this concept of ritual space in gaming, I find myself very much drawn to that, especially when thinking back to when I had deliberately set up things to create a sort of ritual space prior to meeting my pagan friends, without ever once thinking of it in those terms. I can't say this interest has had much effect on my actual gaming, but it's a concept that I'd like to explore more in actual play, because from what I've seen from my own earlier experiences and what I've read about since makes me think that, with the right people, it can have a profound impact on the quality of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I'd be really interested in discussing the specific concept of ritual space further. Anyone game to come with me, if I start a new thread?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262354/#Comment_262354" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T15:42:27+00:00" title="March 16, 2010  3:42PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll meet you over there, Lance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielZKlein" title="DanielZKlein"><img alt="DanielZKlein" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielZKlein">DanielZKlein</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262357/#Comment_262357" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T15:50:59+00:00" title="March 16, 2010  3:50PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a somewhat outspoken atheist; I won't bring the issue up myself, but if someone asks, I won't hedge. I've kind of always silently felt this way, but only recently started thinking very clearly about my beliefs. The main way that this connects to gaming is that I have an, uhm, ungodly obsession with theist themes. I do a little writing sometimes, and gods and devils always sneak in. I used to be exclusively a trad gamer until about a year ago (Zombie Cinema was my first indie game--hey Eero!), and in my old group in Germany I was *always* the GM. I had somewhat of a reputation for overly intricate adventures, and they were all about God/gods in some very direct way. <br><br>The very first campaign I ever ran was in AD&amp;D 2nd, and somehow it ran for 7 years. It started with an annual festival to the gods in a fantasy world where the gods had become silent over the last few hundred years; the last adventure in the campaign was about a supervillain lich who had a plan to replace the entire Pantheon with a troupe of sock-puppet extra-dimensional entities that thought of themselves as deities, but weren't really. There was a lot of Pratchettian belief-equals-power in it. More recently I built a Spirit of the Century adventure around an experimental theologian.<br><br>It feels odd to reject any notion of supernatural entities without a trace of doubt and yet to be so fascinated by the fiction surrounding them.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262365/#Comment_262365" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T16:46:43+00:00" title="March 16, 2010  4:46PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Geek-hippy Christian.

I think about God a lot.<br/><br/>Most recently, I played a devout and deeply conflicted Muslim vampire in a <i>VtR</i> larp, a Brainer who believed she (or a Brainer ancestor) killed God in <i>Apocalypse World</i>, and a joyfully faithful future terrorist zealot in <i>Misspent Youth</i>. Most of the characters I play have an association with a higher power, including a few who passionately deny the existence of such a thing. It doesn't always come out in play, but it's in my head. At the moment, I play with people who think about, too (athieists, Pagans, Christians of some variety) so it comes up often.<br/><br/>The spiritual and superstitious beliefs of slaves figures prominently in <i>Steal Away Jordan</i>.

I don't espouse any beliefs, I don't engage in any sort of ritualized religious behavior except by accident (sometimes I start praying reflexively). I don't allow myself belief in anything specific. My household is religiously Hindu, almost by accident: my fiance is culturally but not spiritually Hindu, and my six year old is devoutly Hindu. My future mother-in-law visits occasionally and we end up doing more religious stuff as a result, because she's very devout too. We always celebrate the important Hindu holidays, regardless.<br/><br/>If there's religion in a game I'm in, I tend to bristle if it's for laughs\\snake oil\\making fun of how religion = stupidity. I don't usually delve too deeply into my characters' religious beliefs, probably due to my issues, but I'm always happy to see a genuine exploration of faith and belief at the table. Right now I'm playing a quietly religious girl in Apocalypse World: she was raised "right," not to do wrong, to keep to yourself and work hard and be good, and when you die you go someplace better than this hell on Earth. Her entire religion/cult committed a mass suicide when she was ten, of which she is now the only survivor. Her aunt hid her away. She's got a lot of guilt, and oddly, still believes\u2014 though she doesn't like to talk about it, for fear that people wouldn't understand. There's this passage from my favorite poem, "Ode: Intimations on Immortality, From Recollections of Early Childhood" by Wordsworth:<br/><br/><i>      Though nothing can bring back the hour<br/>          Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;<br/>              We will grieve not, rather find<br/>              Strength in what remains behind;<br/>              In the primal sympathy<br/>              Which having been must ever be;<br/>              In the soothing thoughts that spring<br/>              Out of human suffering;<br/>              In the faith that looks through death,<br/>          In years that bring the philosophic mind.</i><br/><br/>That's a really heavy influence.

When I play people of faith who aren't villains, I find it difficult to reconcile my lack of belief with their beliefs. But this difficulty is interesting. It is most difficult for me when I have to play someone with a sincere faith, especially when it's couched in a religious tradition. Playing a genuine believer in <i><a href="http://www.lumpley.com/dogsources.html" rel="nofollow">Dogs in the Vineyard</a></i> truthfully was very difficult for me, but rewarding. I'm sad that game is dead now.<br/><br/>I frequently play the "doubting" type, though. In <i><a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=451" rel="nofollow">Apocalypse World</a></i>, my first character read the psychic maelstrom by reading people and situations. The current one does so by pulling alternate reality versions of herself in, pseudo-science-fictioning it.<br/><br/>At times, I have felt judged, attacked, or the subject of irritation for playing my characters this way. I'm caught between a "fuck you" impulse, and my ordinary impulse to try and smooth over social bullshit and get along.<br/><br/>PS: I feel very welcome seeing so much (reasonable, non-assholic) atheism being claimed here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262484/#Comment_262484" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T09:37:26+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  9:37AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Parthenia</cite>I was baptized in my father's faith, Church of Christ when I was 13.

I remember being taught that the Pope was the Anti-Christ, the Catholic Church was the Whore of Babylon, and pretty much everyone who didn't believe the way we did were going to Hell.  <br/><br/>To put it mildly it was a shock to realize that I needed to join the Catholic Church.

(Most Finns are members of the state church, note, but when we call somebody "Christian" it really means the fringe that actually believes in something more than having a respectable wedding ceremony.)<br/><br/>Anyway, I was reminded to note that by what Hans mentioned about his religious roleplaying qualms. I've read some about the American anti-rpg scare, so I have some handle on American evangelical thinking on roleplaying games - seems like the issue is mostly about conservatism in that the sane anti-D&amp;D activist or parent doesn't usually believe in any direct mystical consequences (demon attacks or whatnot) that'd attach to roleplaying, but rather believes that proper thinking follows from proper education, and therefore roleplaying is dangerous due to how its a media form controlled by unchristian sources. Pure conservatism in that the idea is to preserve your worldview by limiting your exposure to alternative ideas.<br/><br/>This comes back to my own experiences with roleplaying and religion in that the Finnish Christians (at least the sort I seem to meet) seem to be considerably more liberal in how and where they see the lines of proper behavior and hobby. The church is mandated to be considerably more in line with the overall society around here because of how something like 80% of Finns are members, so perhaps that influences the attitudes. We used to play at the local parish house (Call of Cthulhu of all things) in my youth, for instance, and I don't think I've ever personally met a Christian (or a Christian roleplayer for that matter) who'd put any sort premium of suspicion on roleplaying games in comparison to books or television; just like you can watch tv and be a Christian, you can also play roleplaying games.<br/><br/>I actually discussed this exact thing with my theologian/roleplayer friend in January or so, now that I think of it. I'd just read <a href="http://www.chick.com/articles/frpg.asp" rel="nofollow">this</a> funny piece by William Schnoebelen and was interested in how a Finnish Christian roleplayer would think about the basic idea that you should avoid roleplaying because it is an unchristian activity that might give you unchristian ideas. My friend at least didn't seem too enhanced by the conservative argument; to him it seemed obvious that a part of the Christian duty is to live in society and experience it, encountering whatever ideas the world might have to offer, even when they're unchristian ideas. So I was sort of impressed by that as a Christian attitude.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262586/#Comment_262586" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T15:27:17+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  3:27PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice thoughts, Eero.

I'd just read<a href="http://www.chick.com/articles/frpg.asp" rel="nofollow">this</a>funny piece by William Schnoebelen and was interested in how a Finnish Christian roleplayer would think about the basic idea that you should avoid roleplaying because it is an unchristian activity that might give you unchristian ideas. My friend at least didn't seem too enhanced by the conservative argument; to him it seemed obvious that a part of the Christian duty is to live in society and experience it, encountering whatever ideas the world might have to offer, even when they're unchristian ideas. So I was sort of impressed by that as a Christian attitude.</blockquote>\nSo, there's this whole thing with American Evangelicalism where people are trying to create a bubble of safe, protected, "Christian" culture. I think that's where the anti-D&amp;D, anti-rocknroll Christian mindset comes from. Personally, I think it's bullshit and not in line with the gospels at all, but I'll leave it there because this isn't about my baggage.<br/><br/>My qualms with Seance were less about not wanting to come in contact with "unchristian" ideas and more about, well, actually believing in demons and thinking that it's probably not the best for me to be roleplaying a seance.  It's hard to explain, because I can see how that could sound like I'm trying to keep myself away from "unchristian" things. I guess it's this: I don't think playing Seance is a bad thing for a Christian to do, necessarily. Opting out of playing wasn't a logical thing at all, it was all from the gut: I felt tangibly nervous and uncomfortable at the prospect, for a variety of reasons (beliefs, upbringing reading Chick tracts, mother's guilt, etc.) some of which may genuinely have to do with my Christianity and some of which is extraneous B.S. Still, I don't think I'll ever be comfortable playing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

I was confirmed as Catholic in the eighth grade, but it never really meant anything to me because I wasn't really given the choice to say no. I went to a Catholic school and it was essentially an expectation that everyone was going to be confirmed. No one ever really asked us if that's what we wanted, or told us what it was really supposed to mean.<br/><br/>Anywho, I gradually fell out of any sort of religious tendencies (with no dramatic revelations or any such thing), and am now a secular humanist. I also consider myself agnostic. To clarify, as agnostic is a vague term: I think it IS possible that there is a god, or some sort of omnipotent force (advanced transcendent life-forms, anyone?), because logically, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.  At the same time, I feel that the absence of evidence isn't making a good case for the presence of god, either, so I choose to live my life as a secular humanist and just be the best person I can be based on morals that I've picked up from many sources, including religions, and have reasoned through myself.<br/><br/>I do like to think about religion and it's effect on society and individuals, but I've never studied it in any real depth. I've felt, on occasion, the powerful forces that can draw people to religious communities, as well as the forces that can drive them away. I've taken basic philosophy and psychology courses in university, religious studies in high school.  I've known devout Catholics, holiday-only Catholics, atheists, agnostics, neo-pagans, etc. Sadly, going to Catholic schools, I've never really known any devout Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, etc., and I feel that's an unfortunate hole in my life experience.<br/><br/>As for how this has affected my gaming, I'm not entirely sure that it has.  I guess I feel perfectly comfortable playing a variety of characters with a variety of religious views, but most of my gaming hasn't really addressed the issue. In most D&amp;D settings, for example, the gods are real and there's no doubting that. In other games, religion hasn't really been part of the plot. I do have plans to play Dogs in the Vineyard sometime in the next month or so, and perhaps I'll go into it with a little more thought than I would have, thanks to this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262692/#Comment_262692" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T08:31:05+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  8:31AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ry</cite>I don't hold religious views, but have a strong belief in compassion.

I wanted to play a druid who believed in nature-red-in-tooth-and-claw darwinism, but was told that this was a sure-fire ticket to eternal damnation and thus not a reasonable choice any sentient being would make.

I consider the personal pursuit of science to be a necessary counterpart to Buddhism, for reasons that are irrelevant to this discussion. My thesis project in college was a mystical allegory about a particular branch of computer science and its similarities to a particular branch of Jewish mysticism. I have a great deal of respect for atheism, as I think it helps people get away from a lot of horrible baggage and look more closely at the Universe as it exists. Jewish and Buddhist practice (broadly defined) help me look closely at the World, but I've known a lot of people who have only felt comfortable reading articles on science once they've formally rejected their religion, and if they need to reject something in order to gain the ability to explore, then awesome.</p>\n<p>I've played characters who were atheist (many), Gnostic Christian (A Byzantine alchemist who returned to England with a Crusader to bring civilization back), Catholic (a Jesuit vampire, embraced by Jesus Christ himself in the secret catacombs of the Vatican), an ex-Catholic Buddhist (another Jesuit who went to India to convert, wound up making a journey to the Himalayas and had his mind blown), a number of Muslims (even not counting my characters in Thou Art But a Warrior, but the most notable one was a knight caught on the edge between poet/ and warrior/leader). I've played a few games as Jewish characters, but the only one that I remember clearly was Rabbi Loew, the guy who putatively created the Golem.</p>\n<p>I don't, personally, have to think that a religion is valid in order to explore it fictionally. I mean, that's the point of exploration, isn't it? I don't think <em>any</em> of us have a strong grasp on the actual structure of the Universe, so while I'm fairly confident that some paradigms are more wrong than others, trying on a wig won't make me blond.</p>\n<p>That's not to say that I always portray a religion sympathetically. Not by any stretch. I think that religions are very often used as an excuse for material horrors at the hands of humans. Ultimately, after all, religion is something that people do. Their beliefs aren't at all interesting until they become evident in action*. I think that some religions have a lot to answer for as moral systems that encourage socioeconomic division and imperialism, for instance, and I might play a character who either enacts that moral system or is wrestling with the privileges it gets them.</p>\n<p>Curiously, it's very rare that I play a member of the dominant religion of the setting (though that might be because things are interesting according to their distinction). Sometimes, the character is just far from home, and sometimes the character is just weird.</p>\n<p>* This is an important feature of Judaism, which is not really concerned with what you believe at all. This gets applied to characters I play and games I design, so this might be the part of this post that actually answers the question.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262970/#Comment_262970" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-19T09:30:34+00:00" title="March 19, 2010  9:30AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

They do things because they're the best thing they can think of to do.</p>\n<p>So, for instance, two Watchdogs of the King of Life:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Frank Redboots was a rapacious, evil murderer. Eventually, that caught up to him, and he went down in a hail of bullets and a spray of blood. As he lay, not quite dead, but buried, the King of Life came to him and told him, "Oh, no you don't. You don't get off that easy. You have to go back and make good." So he did. He was a force for justice, letting nothing stand between him and the best, most moral, least harmful solution to the town's problem. This probably involved killing people, which he was very good at, but he was keeping a very close eye on that tally sheet. Because he was going to do so much good, he was going to get into Heaven \u2014 and then he was going to kill the King of Life in a hail of bullets and a spray of blood. What the King had offered him was capricious and terrible. No one else got that chance. He got the chance because he'd done so much evil. And if the King allowed so much evil in the world, just so he could get a good watchdog, the King was evil. And he was out to put an end to that.</p></li>\n<li><p>Daniel Yancey is a romantic. He loves all the parts of the Book of Life (particularly the Book of Songs) as poetry. He sees them as fallible words trying to express the inexpressible beauty and tragedy of the Universe. He doesn't think the King can show up to make the world right \u2014\xa0if He could, he would, or he wouldn't be good at all. He thinks that the worst sin is the sin of insincere love. People get married for stupid reasons, hate each other and resent their families, and then people die. Not always violently, but they starve, they turn to alcohol, they sacrifice themselves for what others think is right instead of what they know to be right. When last seen, he'd rescued a girl from a terrible family, and was trying to get her to make her own decisions about where to live, who to marry, and how to be responsible to herself so she could know sincere love when she found it. She opted to stay in another town, but he was pretty sure she'd made the wrong decision. He kept looking back over his shoulder as they moved on.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the first case, the dude's a religious fanatic. He's following some sort of code by the letter, which is all the King cares about. But he's doing right along the way. And his goal makes sense, even if it's crazypants outside of the context (which no one else has \u2014\xa0I don't remember if he even told anyone what his deal was).</p>\n<p>In the second case, the kid is in love with the world. That's the form that his religion takes. He loves that the King of Life has set a table for His chosen people, and he figures that only those too hurt to see the bounty will become sinners. What he's discovering is just how many of the people are hurt. Crops fail, people act desperate, then spiteful, and they escalate, escalate, escalate. He just doesn't know how to help.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262993/#Comment_262993" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-19T11:02:14+00:00" title="March 19, 2010 11:02AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Hans">@Hans</a>: your reaction to socreor and the seance game is me 100% as well.

And for some reason, the entire world is freaking out about whether to file that under fiction or nonfiction.<br/>What's actually more important is to find out what structures that story is emerging from, why it's being told, and what stories the storyteller would like to hear in return.<br/><br/>As long as your stories aren't fueling a structure that squashes other stories, there are absolutely no worries. And there's no need for truth.<br/><br/>Spiritualities are stories about certain stuff.<br/>That certain stuff is obviously important to us as humans, because we are frantic about proving our stories about it, and in making new stories.<br/>I think... as long as you are telling some sort of story about that stuff, and are able to hear all the other stories being shared... you're golden.<br/><br/>My story is about void, and the freedom to create, and the insecurity that comes with freedom, and going inward.<br/>It's the story I tell when there's a discussion about spirituality, if I want to tell a story at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263055/#Comment_263055" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-20T00:08:23+00:00" title="March 20, 2010 12:08AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Krippler</cite><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>My Sunday school teacher in the 80s taught us that "in the advanced levels" of D&amp;D, players were taught to worship and summon actual demons.

And I've had the "D&amp;D is a recipe for summoning demons!" lecture more than once, and that idiocy is one of the things that drove me away from organized religion and made me an atheist for a good long while.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that in certain gaming circles, admitting that one is Christian is like announcing that one eats babies for breakfast.  A large part of this is because the conservative evangelical Christians have much better sound-bite PR.  And in particular, in the areas where I grew up and went to college, there was a large conservative evangelical population, and so many of the gamers in those circles were former evangelical Christians who had rejected all Christianity.  As a result, I've often found myself in post-game (or during-a-break-in-game) Christian-bashing sessions.  Needless to say, in those environments I don't make much of a fuss about being Christian myself unless I want to escalate the out-of-game drama, which I rarely want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, things like sacrifice and atonement, repentance, forgiveness and its lack, all of these fascinate me as themes because they connect with something I care about.  And the question of faith, and the calling to the clergy, and whether it's real or not, all that is also fascinating.  I'm not at all threatened by games that claim they are about the real nature of the universe, in which that real nature is not Christian, any more than I am threatened by games that claim that Aristotelean physics works, or point-and-shoot magic exists.

Religious affiliation and political affiliation are not always the same, and shouldn't be.<br>12 Step programs are faith based organizations that are specifically not politically affiliated with any politics, which helps to protect the anonymity of their members and helps to promote unity under a common cause: recovery. I know a good number of people from all walks of politics who consider their religious affiliation to be a 12 Step program. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

Quakers (Society of Friends) is one that easily comes to mind. Christian organizations are often the first on the scene of international, national, and political disasters.<br><br>During the Civil Rights Era, Christian organizations funded freedom rides, because they believed that it was the Christian thing to do to fight injustice. There were and are Christians (Jews, Muslims, Buddhists....) on either side of the issue of Civil Rights (for African Americans in the 50's and 60's and for gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgendered people in the present day.)<br/><br/>Quakers played a major role and conducting the underground railroad.

And for some reason, the entire world is freaking out about whether to file that under fiction or nonfiction.<br/>What's actually more important is to find out what structures that story is emerging from, why it's being told, and what stories the storyteller would like to hear in return.<br/><br/>As long as your stories aren't fueling a structure that squashes other stories, there are absolutely no worries. And there's no need for truth.<br/><br/>Spiritualities are stories about certain stuff.<br/>That certain stuff is obviously important to us as humans, because we are frantic about proving our stories about it, and in making new stories.<br/>I think... as long as you are telling some sort of story about that stuff, and are able to hear all the other stories being shared... you're golden.<br/><br/>My story is about void, and the freedom to create, and the insecurity that comes with freedom, and going inward.<br/>It's the story I tell when there's a discussion about spirituality, if I want to tell a story at all.<br/><br/>So you made a pretty specific and awesome response to my post. I haven't responded myself yet because I'm mulling it over. I think spirituality is an awful lot about where you find yourself. Where I find myself is already having been given a set of beliefs. So for me its about testing, refining, and trying to understand. Your position is pretty nearly opposite mine. Except for the void. The only beleifs I really find alien are the ones that deny there's a void at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263429/#Comment_263429" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-22T11:25:21+00:00" title="March 22, 2010 11:25AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well I find all belief systems weird.

I rarely play a character that has a Buddhist outlook. Playing a belief system without making it a stereotype is difficult.

I was raised nominally Episcopalian but was more a Calvinist. Learned about Sufis in 1986 and converted to Sunni Islam in 1996. It is a small step from Calvinism to Islam (I think). All it takes is being more impressed by Jesus as a man than as God. I was always more a heretic so jumping ship was easy. The food is better and aside from Ramadan it is much easier than being a Christian. <br/><br/>That being said I've also got a masters degree, read Greek and Roman history, and am very much an intellectual so I like science and the Western Enlightenment. <br/><br/>Does it effect my gaming? Probably a little. I will tend to avoid doing evil things in games because thinking about such things isn't what I find fun. I'll also tend to take the anti-imperialistic side in wargames. I'll gladly charge a thousand Dervishes at the British, run a Viet Cong cell or run Mexican Peasants against Maximilian's French troops that build up any European Empire. This often means I'm on the losing side.<br/><br/>In game design it has a bigger effect. I include sympathetic Muslim characters. I don't build on stereotypes. I also include female characters (either 50% or 33% mix). What I've not done is put in any gay characters but I want to do this to bust that barrier. I effectively joined a minority group in the US and want to encourage greater diveristy because of that.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263505/#Comment_263505" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-22T15:48:43+00:00" title="March 22, 2010  3:48PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a pretty die-hard "destroy all organized religion" sort of atheist though like someone else said upthread, I'm a pretty nice guy and don't bring it up unless asked, but that is how I feel.  Yeah, sometimes religiously motivated people do some pretty good things, but it's like in <i>Aliens</i>: we have to nuke them from orbit, it's the only way to be sure we're safe.<br/><br/>I'm an atheist for theological reasons, and anti-organized-religion for practical and political ones.  (As an aside: in my experience a lot of Westerners who convert to another religion are basically practicing a personal aka "disorganized" religion, and I have no problem with that.  This is not to damn with faint praise the sincerity of such people's commitment, but simply to note that they usually don't inherit any of the cultural stuff that goes along with the religion.)  I'm pretty damn sure I'm on the right side of history, here, too.  I think that in 500 years people who practice an organized religion will be looked at the way we look at Scientologists today.<br/><br/>I'm also a firm believer in the importance of the First Amendment and have no desire to force-convert anyone.  Countries that have tried it (the various Commie regimes and France in the 1790's) have basically replaced spiritual belief with The-State-As-Religion, which is no better.  I have always had friends of a variety of religious backgrounds and belief structures and think this diversity is really important.  I'm deeply opposed to proselytizing in all forms.<br/><br/>Pretty much linked to all that, I really agree with what Joe said upthread about storytelling\u2014gaming pretty much *is* my chosen form of spirituality.  I *don't* actually game "just to have fun," at least not most of the time.  I really like gaming to be provocative and even disturbing.<br/><br/>I have no problem playing characters of any faith or no faith.  I will not portray religious characters as shallow cut-outs or automatically make them fundamentalists, either.  It's called *role*playing for a reason.<br/><br/>(As an aside, I agree with all those who've said that the demonstrable existence of the gods often makes faith less interesting in games, though what bothers me more [and this more properly belongs in the politics thread, perhaps I will repost] is when people in fantasy-medieval societies have post-Enlightenment ideals about equality and justice.)<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263646/#Comment_263646" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T07:29:20+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  7:29AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite> (As an aside: in my experience a lot of Westerners who convert to another religion are basically practicing a personal aka "disorganized" religion, and I have no problem with that.

So my religious traditions are something that was given to me and I didn't have to go find somewhere else. It helps that as a child I asked questions and was given, by and large, thoughtful answers. That's the religion side of the story. It's like your family or genetics: you can choose what to make of it, but you can't choose it.<br/><br/>But given also means having a faith tradition full of things that you didn't particularly choose, and might not have ever chosen on your own. Catholicism is full of traditions, ideas, and beliefs that continue to be strange and amazing to me. Grappling with that stuff is definitely part of faith and spirituality for me, probably the most creative interesting part. That's the more spiritual side of the story. It's like love or friendship: there's a choice involved, but also surprises and challenges.<br/><br/>Also, exactly what Scott said.

I too was given my faith. I was raised a Christian, and we went to church when I was a child. I was "Saved" twice; The first time as a young child at the first church I remember, where my parents (mother and stepfather who was there most of my formative years) were married. The second time as an older child because I had doubts as to whether I'd really understood what it was to be Saved when I made the choice back then. That second time was also at the church I will probably always remember most as "home", where I was also Baptized.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat right there is a micro-example of my relationship with my faith throughout my life. I have always questioned what I was taught, what I believed, and whether I actually believed. The sort of faith that brings comfort to people in rough times has never been mine. Everything I've ever accepted has been filtered through my peculiar logic. I haven't felt comfortable in the church since I was a child. I HAVE felt more comfortable in the fellowship of alternate faiths. I've explored the ideals of a few pagan beliefs, agnosticism, even Satanism, and felt strong resonance with many of the things I discovered there, stronger than what I've felt from my own faith since I was a child. But one thing, and one thing only has kept me from converting or abandoning my faith: What I was raised to believe, at it's stripped-down core, feels True, where the core of these other belief structures have not. My faith was at its strongest when I realized that, amidst my immersion into these other beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo tie this back into the original topic a bit further.. I am attracted to roles which have that unshakable confidence in the rightness of their beliefs. Paladins are amazing, completely aside from them being a force for righteousness, because the basic concept has them being totally assured in their faith, something I've never really had. A different facet of that same preference is the anticipation of what happens if that faith is well and truly shaken... It's the flip side to my own voyage of discovery. Where I was never confident in my faith, the shattered paladin was, and is no longer. How does that compare and contrast with me? Will his journey mirror mine, or was the damage too much to recover from?<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there's the nonchalant atheist. It's... basically impossible for my mind to conceive of the notion that someone lacks faith without some sort of damage. Malcolm Reynolds comes to mind. He's jocularly dismissive of Book's faith throughout the series.. But if you weren't paying attention during the first episode, you miss a major underscoring of the character. My first watch-through, I missed it. My second watch through, I sat up, and exclaimed in shock when he kissed the crucifix he wore in Serenity Valley. Suddenly, the bitterness behind his jocularity becomes so stark as to make me feel like an imbecile to have missed it before. When I play a character like that, I usually haven't decided *why* they're atheistic. That's one of the things I'd like to leave to be potentially discovered through play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263773/#Comment_263773" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T17:03:02+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  5:03PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>But given also means having a faith tradition full of things that you didn't particularly choose, and might not have ever chosen on your own.

That leads to certain actions - like being a seeker. One learns not just about what your own faith is but about others as well. For me that leads to tolerance (more modernly termed diversity).<br/><br/>Other people (I'm thinking of my Evil Step Mother-in-law) do not question their faith and in fact view questioning as the ultimate sin. I don't doubt they have strong beliefs but their beliefs do not usually lead to tolerance. Burning heretics, holding witch trials or inquisitions in Spain for Jews and Moors are a far to common extreme outcome. The Chick Publication cited above is a good example of that - It certainly effected people's gaming - they didn't do it. Can't rebel against God after all!<br/><br/>Other dicotomies come to mind. High Church - Low Church (Catholic - Pentocostal) Emotional Evangelical - Intellectual Not Emotional. I'm certain these effect play as well. Narrow world view - Broad world view and more. Literal - Metaphorical. Uncertain - Certain. Gentle and Kind - Rigid and Judgmental.<br/><br/>My wife is a Lutheran and tells me she has a better deal with God as she eats bacon. We both laugh, that's why our marriage works. She's also tolerant of my game designing which honestly puts a lot more strain on our relationship.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263863/#Comment_263863" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-24T06:55:03+00:00" title="March 24, 2010  6:55AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Getting back to the original question for a bit.  Thinking through this as I'm putting characters together to play at a con I see a desire to understand things, to question.  I don't mind characters that are tragically flawed.  But, I don't see even the character ending up branded as the villain as like thinking of themselves as irredeemably evil.  I guess I wouldn't want to play someone like that but otherwise I'm cool.  I can definitely see myself in a lot of my characters some before I came to Faith others after.

I don't want to imagine myself being that rigid in my world view. With Dogs in the Vinyard I imagine the players beginning to shot one another over when to not shoot the pregnant woman. That might be fun but I'd get there real fast and that would not be fun. It gets to creative agenda issues. My character (if they are a reflection of me) would not join or stick around this kind of religion. I'd be looking to escape rather than enforce. <br/><br/>That could be fun. Escape from the Vinyard...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11746/what-is-your-spirituality-and-how-does-that-affect-your-gaming/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11746/what-is-your-spirituality-and-how-does-that-affect-your-gaming">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11746/what-is-your-spirituality-and-how-does-that-affect-your-gaming/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11746/what-is-your-spirituality-and-how-does-that-affect-your-gaming/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11746%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11746%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
