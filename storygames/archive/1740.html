                            I believe bluffing only works when you can hide your resources. It works in poker because I don't know what cards you're holding. With dice, noone---including you---knows what you got until you roll. There isn't any way for you to bluff. You can *gamble* (I <i>bet</i> I'll roll 10+), but not really bluff in the strict sense.<br/><br/>Maybe if we had a DitV style conflict system where we hid the result of our rolls before raising and seeing and such...<br/><br/>[edit] <i>Cross-posted with people.</i> [/edit]                        </div>

                            There is no codified bluffing in Dust Devils. <br/><br/>However, it can happen. Here's how: <br/><br/>You deal cards, and everyone knows how many so-and-so has, etc. Each person may place chips up as Stakes. These are not narrative goals. These are just resources. If you defeat your opponents in the Deal, you double your Stakes (i.e.  you win more chips for yourself). That's it. It's really pretty simple. Importantly, the chips are between you and the "bank," not you and your opponents.<br/><br/>BUT, I have observed people hesitate upon seeing that their opponent is willing to place Stakes given his hand. They MAY opt to spend 1 Chip and fold at this point. This is basically bluffing.<br/><br/>In my experience it's rare, but it can happen. One or two people have remarked that they like this a lot and would willingly encourage it to happen more often.                        </div>

                            Well, I do.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorites is a larp system I designed using matching. The leader going into the match must reveal a number between 1 and 5, the opposition does as well. An opponent matching the leader wins, while an unmatched leader wins. The twist is, the amount the leader reveals is the base degree of success.<br/>
<br/>
The extra twist is that opponents can recoup, and throw a zero, letting the leader win without opposition to get back the resources they invested. <br/>
<br/>
Frankly if you cut out randomizers, but still want depth and unpredictability from simple mechanics you need to make information assymetric, which usually means someone can and should bluff someone else. <br/>

<p>Uh, to answer the question, I guess those people, who are clearly not everyone here, who didn't support bluffing in their designs, are people that didn't care about bluffing for some reason. Maybe they found it boring or objectionable, or it was subordinated to a more important piece of the design.</p>

                            Bluffing can work as long as everyone knows it's "that kind of game". Certainly supporting mechanics would help. The problem is most games--both on a mechanical and narrative level--aren't designed for bluffing.                        </div>

We're in conflict, with cards.   We have stakes, good ones.<br/><br/>Someone deals 'em.  We can use traits to pull more and discard, and we stake chips on the play.  All intentions are above the board, known and clear.<br/><br/>The cards show me what me character has got.  The chips I put up show how strong a front he puts on.<br/><br/>So I charge, screaming, weapon out - even though I've got no idea how to use it (no redraws) and I'm probably going to flail about like a very ineffective flailing-about-thing if we actually get stuck in.<br/><br/>I'm bluffing.  In game and out.<br/><br/>How is this bad for roleplay?                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><br/>Liars' Dice involves bluffing doesn't it?</blockquote>
::Looks up Wikipedia:: <br/><br/>Yes! But <i>Liars Dice</i> seems to involve rolling the dice before you start making bids. I was thinking about bluffing before you rolled. I should have clarified that. If the results of a roll are hidden, you certainly could bluff.<br/><br/>You know, another aspect of bluffing is the losing player has to have an incentive to give in, I think. In poker, if I bluff early in the round, you might drop out before the bid is increased. That saves you money in the long run. Even late in the game, giving in allows a person to hide what they had, which might be helpful if they were trying to bluff themselves.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timfire</cite>I believe bluffing only works when you can hide your resources. It works in poker because I don't know what cards you're holding. With dice, noone---including you---knows what you got until you roll. There isn't any way for you to bluff. You can *gamble* (I<i>bet</i>I'll roll 10+), but not really bluff in the strict sense.<br/><br/>Maybe if we had a DitV style conflict system where we hid the result of our rolls before raising and seeing and such...<br/><br/>[edit]<i>Cross-posted with people.</i>[/edit]</blockquote>
Players were bluffing thier butts off when they dueled in the last game of Mountain Witch we played.  Of course as you say above, the only reason it happened is the rolls were done in secret.

                            Actually, my current design uses Liar's Dice as the central resolution mechanic.  It's a detective game, so it seems to fit.  Each bid is a conversational thrust or parry.  "Calling" is when someone drops the "bomb" on the conversation, and we see what the fallout is.  It's still very much in process, so we'll see if it works.<br/>

Hole crap, I forgot about my own game! Yeah, players bluff during duels. Alot of the time, players just kinda eye each other, but the opportunity is there if they want it. It's awesome to hear of players really getting into it.                        </div>

                            The interesting thing about Texas Hold-em Poker is that you are only bluffing with your two hole cards.  The rest of your hand gets uncovered on the table one-by-one!  So bluffing isn't so straightforward since your hand can ebb and flow between bets.  And once you get into the real money games, players are much more selective about their bluffing since the stakes are so high.  Anyone can bluff when you are playing for matchsticks:)<br>
<br>
But really the only two things you need to bluff in a RPG are:<br/>
1. Something to hide.<br/>
2. Stakes that are important enough that others will bow out if they feel they don't have the "winning hand".                        </br></br></div>

All three games use cards, which are the bluffers friends. Bluffing is great, it adds a skill element to the usual karma, drama and fortune!                        </div>

So implicit in this question is: why no system mechanic for bluffing?<br/><br/>Because I've seen bluffing in lots of rpg play. It seems a healthy thing.<br/>In Amber DRPG conventions, you are most often not playing an 'auction' character with public resources. You are instead usually playing a PC with murky to hidden resources and therefore much of play is bluffing to <b>avoid</b> conflict tests. This works because once conflict starts, the attribute reveal is quite clear cut and quick, like showing your cards.<br/><br/>Even more significant because once two people 'reveal' in a conflict, the attribute resources of other PCs will still be hidden for some later conflict.                        </div>

                            Many live-action games I've seen do bluffing - I got by in Mind's Eye Theatre just by acting competent and making friends. Anyone who comes into the game after you do and sees you talking to others assumes that you're an uber-powerful badass.<br/><br/>Also, bluffing works in poker because people have things they can lose that actually matter to them (you know, money, clothing, their car, their house...). In an RPG, especially a short-run game, there's very little that matters so much that you can't afford to call instead of fold.                        </div>

<p>Colin, tell that to the player who has to decide whether or not the escalate to Shooting a little girl in a game of Dogs.</p>
<p>It's useful as a mechanic. Like any other mechanic, it does stuff that maybe you want and probably you don't.</p>
<p>We also don't usually:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move pieces around a board</li>
<li>Draw mechanically significant pictures</li>
<li>Use a timer</li>
<li>Lay tiles</li>
<li>Use weighted dice (legally)</li>
<li>Ask trivia questions</li>
</ul>
<p>(obviously, these examples are taken from the shelf of games in front of me)</p>
<p>But we might. Bluffing is interesting because it's a very human type of interaction and story games generate stories about characters. Obviously, it's been useful to some people, not useful, at least yet, to others.</p>

<p>Everyone' s covered bluffing in indie games, now I'll talk about bluffing in traditional rpgs. It's rare, and this may be another reason why few game designers try to make games where you can bluff.</p>
<p>And by "you", I mean the ordinary player. The DM in old-fashioned D&amp;D bluffs almost all the time, because of all that secret information. But ordinary players find it hard to bluff because they have so little they can keep secret; the best they can do is bluff other non-DM players, by not using the best talents and equipment at their disposal and thus creating a false impression of their full capabilities. This happens frequently (I've done it, and I've seen it in practically every game.) However, it's not very satisfying, which may explain why many recent games are against player character secrecy.</p>
<p>One significant exception to old-school bluffing was The Fantasy Trip. It started as <strong>Melee</strong> and <strong>Wizard</strong>, tactical fantasy board games without a GM. There wasn't much bluffing in <strong>Melee</strong> as a stand-alone game, but bluffing was built into <strong>Wizard</strong>; you had to declare things like "I'm casting a Creation spell" or "I'm casting Secret Protection", but you didn't have to identify which spell, and could even opt not to cast the spell. So, you could do things like create an Image of a wolf instead of summoning a real wolf and trick a rival into attacking the Image... or create a hex of shadow, then create something in the shadow, so your opponent doesn't know whether you summoned a demon or created a hex of fire... or didn't create anything at all. When TFT evolved into <strong>In The Labyrinth</strong>, combat and magic were still handled the same way, so you could <em>bluff the GM</em>.</p>

<p>Also, bluffing works in poker because people have things they can lose that actually matter to them (you know, money, clothing, their car, their house...). In an RPG, especially a short-run game, there's very little that matters so much that you can't afford to call instead of fold.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>It's not that the dice are hidden (and it would be a very different game if they were). It's that you have stuff you care about losing. It's fictional stuff, to be sure, but you care about it, or you wouldn't be playing.</p>

                            I've done the 24 hr RPG challenge once, and the result was a game I entitled "Stakes." Basically I had been thinking about how Dust Devils and other theoretically Poker-based games didn't really allow for Poker play. So Stakes is, basically, actual Poker resolution. The chips you bet are things imporant to the character.<br/>
<br/>
"I bet my left leg."<br/>
<br/>
"Oh yeah, I'll see that leg, and raise you my Aunt May!"<br/>
<br/>
"I call with My Mother! Whatcha got?"<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise it's just Poker. So, er, bluffing is key, of course.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A couple of notes here. A "problem" with games like Poker which make bluffing a part of the game is that the optimal strategy is to act randomly. In such a way as people can't predict from your other behavior what you're doing. Anyone who tells you otherwise doesn't understand the Game Theory behind games like Poker.<br/>
<br/>
This actually doesn't leave a lot of strategy to the game. It's an interesting addition, I think, especially as a sub-game in a more complex overall game. But alone it's not a lot to think about. In Stakes, as Joshua notes, since the currency is fictional, and representative of in-game things, the complexity comes from deciding what to wager, and if people think you'd wager those things on a bluff. These can be the "tells."<br/>
<br/>
Still not really intense, but as good or better than Poker with money in terms of complexity (where each dollar is precisely as valuable as the last).<br/>
<br/>
As for bluffing and dice, you could have dice pools that you commit. That leaves things uncertain, but, then again, since these resources are hidden, the situation is already uncertain. I think it's non-problematic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for the issue of open communication, Frank, Tim is right here: If it's a sub-game of the overall activity, it'll work fine. Just as playing Poker does. Heck, if the entire game were competitive, then it would work fine as the entire game.<br/>

<p>But the question can then be "why don't we support it <em>more</em>?" Which I meant to go into a little bit:</p>
<ol>
<li>D&amp;D is the predominate template most games copy, in some way, and D&amp;D has very little bluffing (except DM bluffing players, as i mentioned.)</li>
<li>Because DM bluffs occur in a context of extreme inequality that some people have had bad experiences with, designers challenging the traditional approach to RPGs tend to move towards less secrecy instead of redistributing the power of secrecy.</li>
<li>If a player takes an action that isn't specifically covered by the rules, there's usually referee or group adjudication to verify the action <em>beforehand</em>. In the case of bluffing with character actions, you can't have beforehand adjudication, and gamers seem to fear <em>after the fact</em> adjudication -- they don't want the story to be rewritten by a "do-over".</li>
<li>Simmy systems for magic, combat, or other things are often too clunky for player bluffs. This was a problem with the spell-point system in <strong>In The Labyrinth</strong>, for example.</li>

Well, realistically, who would be bluffing who in most game designs?<br><br>I wasn't kidding earlier when I said that there was an undercurrent of co-operation in most designs. Heavy duty competition got way watered down for a long time in rpg design. Bluffing sort of implies ( at least to me) a kind of competitiveness that rpg culture backed away from, and thus there was no reason to explore the possibility.                        </br></br></div>

<p>Forumula DÃ© uses weighted dice, though not weighted as interestingly as I'd hope; it uses a d2, d3, d4, d6, d10. Because there's no such thing as a d2 or d3, it doubles the number of sides and writes half of the numbers, twice: 1-2, 2-4, 5-8, 7-12, 11-20.</p>
