This is my first actual play report here.  I don't have a lot of gaming time so I was excited to get this Inspectres game in this summer.<br/><br/>My first and last play of Inspectres came about 5 years ago when my daughter was 7.  We played a game with my sister where the Inspectres had to figure out why an old, greedy man was being visited by 3 ghosts every Christmas.  From this I learned that my daughter was a little young to play.  My sister doesn't even remember playing.  It wasn't what I consider a fair test.  And then Life happened, as it does, and 5 years passed and the Stars were finally right!<br/><br/>This time couldn't have been more different.  Everything came together brilliantly.  I told my daughter we were going to play a game "like Ghostbusters" and she was at least curious about and allowed that "maybe" it sounded like it could be fun.  (She's into pre-teen angst so that was a pretty major indication of interest).  And then the night before, the players (all family members) and I were watching Scooby-Doo, Season 1, Episode 3.  And what happens?  Shaggy is about to be slimed by a ghost and says (paraphrased) "Maybe I can use ventriloquism to distract the ghost".  He's using  a Confessional!  I paused playback, told my players to remember that scene, and really felt jazzed to play the following night.<br/><br/>Preparation<br/>What preparation?  This is Inspectres!  I read through the rules once more.  Then I decided that the Client would be none other than Chef Gordon Ramsey and that it would be a traditional ghost haunting at the site of his new restaurant on opening night.  Fun vignettes I would try to work in if possible - the players would get yelled at by the Chef at least once, there would be poltergeist activity with forks and knives and maybe the walls would bleed with all the butchering that had happened in the kitchen over the years. <br/><br/>I swear upon Ron Edwards' grave that I did not share ANY of this information with the players.  The reason for this assurance will become clear in one moment as I introduce the characters.<br/><br/><br/>DRAMATIS PERSONAE<br/>After explaining how skill checks worked and Talent bonuses worked we "rolled up" characters.  This was somewhat amusing to me as only my sister had any experience with prior role-playing games -- D&amp;D.  So she was confused at first because even though I explained how the dice pools work she still thought she needed to roll the dice to generate a 3-18 score.  After that was straightened out I explained the "Take 4" rule and each decided to have a skill of 4 in one area.  I also set up the Confessional chair and explained how it worked just like the scene in Scooby-Doo.<br/><br/>CHLOE, played by my sister Catherine.<br/>Chloe was the Chief Pyrotechnic Engineer and Baker of sugary delightfulness(!).  Oh no, THAT skill won't be useful at all in ghost haunted restaurant!  She had a 4 Contact skill which during play leads to her famous tagline "I know a guy" and a 3 for Technology which gets her some pretty sweet equipment...for baking.<br/><br/>IVANOVA, played by my wife Alexandra<br/>Ex Russian military and CEO of the company.  Athletics was her 4 dice skill.<br/><br/>BLUE ELIZABETH ROSE, played by my 12yo daughter Sarah<br/>Medical Officer.  Expert in Japanese culture, especially anything to do with manga.  (guess what she likes to read in real life lol?).  Athletics at 4, Academics at 1.<br/><br/>The franchise started with 6 dice.  2 in the library, 2 in the bank and 1 each in the gym and credit card.<br/><br/>And with that we are ready to start playing!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nicholas_Caldwell" title="Nicholas_Caldwell"><img alt="Nicholas_Caldwell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nicholas_Caldwell">Nicholas_Caldwell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448520/#Comment_448520" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-14T13:16:59+00:00" title="September 14, 2015  1:16PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PLAY<br/>Play started during character creation!  As I explained how confessionals worked my daughter asked "so it could be anything?"  "Anything" I said.  "It can even be from earlier in the day or describe something that will happen in the future - like Dr Who."  She rubbed her hands together and giggled with an evil laugh and next thing I knew she had LEAPED ("LEAPED, I tell you") into the confessional chair to explain how her character had come into possession of two katanas and how they could be used to locate ghosts.<br/><br/>Ok, so that's not quite what I had in mind but I had also just explained the improv comedy principle of "Always say yes" to whatever anyone else suggests.  So just as Blue Rose is walking into her job interview with Chloe and Ivanova *ping!* two ghost-finding katana swords appear strapped to her back!<br/><br/>Then I explain how you have to make a Technology roll to get stuff and that she'll need to roll pretty high to get ghost-locating swords.  Sarah rolls 4 so I tell her "well, it locates ghosts _some_ of the time" and she promptly says "and the rest of the time it locates cheesecake!".  And so it did!  Off to a great start and we haven't started playing yet!<br/><br/>So on to the starting interview.  Chloe and Ivanova are interviewing the new recruit, Blue Rose (of the katanas).  Chloe is actually working on perfecting a candy apple recipe and not really paying attention.  Ivanova welcomes Blue Rose, tells her they are expanding the franchise and asks what special skills or talents she can bring to the organization.  Blue Rose whips her katanas from her back and chops all the apples into perfectly sizes slices (with a 6 on Athletics + Talent roll).  Chloe just stares at her.  Ivanova says "You're hired".<br/><br/>I ask them to describe the offices and they quickly learn that "whoever says it rolls the dice for it".  So they end up with:<br/>* the afore-mentioned ghost and/or cheesecake hunting katanas<br/>* Russian surplus military equipment including explosives and AK-47s<br/>* a gold plated commode with bidet which was a gift from their first client (who, in a confessional by Ivanova, apparently was haunted by a Giant Ghost Rabbit (remember this!) )<br/>* a silver whisk which can also disrupt spectral energy<br/>* a pastry torch which converted into a flame-thrower (which, in another confessional, Chloe relates was responsible for burning down the restaurant where she was working and got her fired -- which is what led her to Inspectres - remember this, too!)<br/><br/>While all this was going on I did remind that they were running a business and that some normal business things might be useful...you see, I was planning to have the client CALL them but without phones that wasn't possible so...<br/><br/>There was a pounding at the door.  A client!  Roll a one die stress roll! Chloe gets a cool die but doesn't want to take the lead so Ivanova answers the door.   Standing there is a very distraught man covered with flour and wearing a chef's hat.  He tells them that "ze chef" sent him because they have no phone and that they can still get the job if they can get to 1313 Main Street in 15 minutes.<br/><br/>So the team heads out and jumps in the car....um, did anybody roll for transportation?  No?  So Blue Rose decides to just run there, rolls a 6 on Athletics and when Chloe and Ivanova look around she's already disappeared.  So Alexandra jumps into the confessional chair and announces "Just then, my personal cell phone rings.  It's Dmitri letting me know that the super-secret Russian military vehicle is completed and he's almost there to drop it off."  (Love it!)<br/><br/>Unfotunately, this is followed by a 1 on the Tech roll, so when the vehicle pulls up it has a flat tire.  "Do not worry. I fix in ten minutes! No problem!" says Dmitiri in a thick Russian accent.  10 minutes!  We'll be late!  Hmm, what to do?  Catherine jumps into the confessional chair and "I hadn't told Ivanova yet, but I had just finished installing the rocket boosters on my moped and it's just around the corner."<br/><br/>And boy, was it!  With a Tech roll of 6 the moped actually launches into the air!  (Chloe: "Well, I wasn't expecting that!").  A quick Athletic roll to prevent falling off, a bumpy landing with a 1 die stress test (which Chloe cooly passes (with her one cool die she automatically passes)) and they arrive...and see Blue Rose taking a nap at the top of the steps in front of the door leading to the restaurant.<br/><br/>For such it was, and not just any restaurant.  This was Chez Ramsey Ramsey, Chef Gordon Ramsey's newest restaurant venture!  And according to the sign it's Grand Opening Night!  A red carpet led up the steps to the front doors -- which just at that moment burst open and there is the Chef Himself!  He looks angry about something and at first he's upset about Blue Rose sleeping in front of his restaurant, but then he catches sight of her Inspectres badge and says "Oh, it's you! Finally!  Talk to Jean Pierre and get those ghosts out of MY restaurant!"<br/><br/>Jean Pierre meets with them briefly, tells them that they have the run of the place, that the grand opening is in 4 hours, and then lets them into the restaurant foyer.  It's the same layout as Hell's Kitchen -- a red carpet leads into double-doors leading to the dining room, there are pictures of famous people on the wall, and expensive chandeliers.<br/><br/>A crashing noise comes from the dining room, the double-doors blow open and knives and forks come shooting out for a 1 die Stress check.  Ivanova's military experience allows her to cooly side-step the knife flying at her while Blue Rose has flash-backs to ninja training and has a nuclear meltdown on her stress check.  She drops her Contact score to 0 and we describe it as a nick on her cheek which she sews up leaving a fearsome scar (which Sarah is thrilled with -- got that? She totally blew the roll and loved the result!  This is why Inspectres is so much fun!). <br/> <br/>Chloe still has her Cool die so passes the stress check automatically.  She announces an attack on the ghost (notice that I hadn't mentioned a ghost - the player assumed a ghost and so it's a ghost!) with her pastry torch/flamethrower.  A mediocre roll results in flaming the ghost alright, but now it's on fire and still moving around dropping flaming ectoplasm all over the nice red carpet and burning holes in it.  ("Oh, no! Not AGAIN!" moans Chloe, referencing her back story).  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nicholas_Caldwell" title="Nicholas_Caldwell"><img alt="Nicholas_Caldwell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nicholas_Caldwell">Nicholas_Caldwell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448521/#Comment_448521" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-14T13:17:40+00:00" title="September 14, 2015  1:17PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>Blue Rose steps up next with a katana attack which, due to another mediocre roll, results in the ghost getting sliced up just like the apples...so now there are 3 ghosts, on fire, dropping flaming ectoplasm everywhere and not a single franchise die earned.<br/> <br/>(At this point, I am wondering if my 14 franchise dice goal for the first mission is going to be too steep.  But I remember reading  that you need to trust the system and keep throwing stress at the players and so I do so with glorious results.  I mention this here just in case other new players have similar doubts.  In fact - I wish I had made them all roll for stress once the client's red carpet caught on fire!).<br/> <br/>Chloe utters her second-most-famous tag line: "I've got this!".  She grabs her silver plated whisk and some taffy from when she was making candy apples (see above) and in a kind of taffy-making-frenzy glues the parts of the ghost together.  That works, but she ends up glued to the ghost herself and the ghost is now pulling her around the (increasingly on fire) room.  The smell of burning caramel permeates the atmosphere.<br/> <br/>Ivanova decides enough is enough and gets out some good old fashioned Russian military surplus explosive.  THAT can't possible go wrong!  It's got salt and iron filings wrapped around it.  Sadly, Ivanova is used to dealing with corporeal threats and while her throw is on target the explosive just sails through the ghost.  The explosion does dislodge Chloe, but now there's a huge burned hole in the carpet.<br/><br/>After this, Ivanova decides to bring the fire under control and uses her spec-ops training to do backflip after backflip extinguishing all the little fires on the carpet and this works magnificently!<br/><br/>And with yet another confessional, my daughter (that's MY daughter!) jumps into the confessional and reveals that she just remembered a magic spell that just might work.  Brilliant -- but I point out she only has one die in Academics and really should have studied harder ("Daa-aad" Sarah says).  But it's ok!  They have a library card.  And with the added dice, the spell goes off without a hitch and Blue Rose earns the first franchise dice of the evening.  Because with a 6, not only does she realize exactly what type of ghost it is, but also she remembers that this particular ghost hates the color pink.  So she banishes the ghost to another dimension where everything is pink and there are pink unicorns and bubblegum and cotton candy and the ghost gets stucks in the bubble gum and is sitting there for all eternity hating the color pink.  Poof!  <br/> <br/>But there's still the problem of what to do with the destroyed red carpet.  I tell them not to worry, that it will just be taken out of their check....  "Oh wait," pipes up Chloe. "I know a guy!".  She makes a call while Blue Rose pokes her head through the double-doors leading to the dining room because there are still crashing noises coming from there.<br/><br/>Well, Catherine aces the Contact roll and not only does she KNOW Achmed the Persian Rug seller but it turns out he was an ex-boyfriend and now she has a date for Saturday night, a red carpet on the way, and a nice Persian rug for the office.  (more franchise dice!)<br/><br/>So now that everything is back under control, we ask Sarah/Blue Rose what the crashing noise was?  She says it was a member of her favorite band who is wearing a Batman costume and crashing around trying to find his Bat-keychain for his Bat-car.  (I could never make that up! Oh, to be 12 again!).<br/><br/>"Michael, is that you?" asks Chloe.  Well no, the Contact dice say, but it turns out that he IS in a band and he was doing a publicity appearance for the restaurant but lost his keys and please, if they won't tell anybody that he is having to moonlight at this second gig he will give them tickets to his show.  "These keys?" Chloe asks and another die is gained for the franchise.  (At this point they are exactly halfway to the franchise dice goal and we take a quick intermission)<br/><br/>More when we get back from the break!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nicholas_Caldwell" title="Nicholas_Caldwell"><img alt="Nicholas_Caldwell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nicholas_Caldwell">Nicholas_Caldwell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448522/#Comment_448522" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-14T13:19:39+00:00" title="September 14, 2015  1:19PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>Returning from commercial (which are gleefully described by the players - the only one I remember was "weird, surrealistic one that turns out to be for a perfume I'll never buy"), the party regroups.  They're in the dining room, watching the chefs prepare the food. They're busy and it's chaotic and steam is going everywhere but there doesn't seem to be anything really wrong -- until they hear someone scream.  It seems to be coming from the walk-in freezer at the back which suddenly bursts open.  A chef runs out and throws herself to the ground as all the ghosts of all the steaks come stampeding out.  Texas longhorns, they are, and their horns are hooking into pots and pans and sending people flying.  The biggest, meanest ghost comes hurtling at them with fire in its eyes and just as I am about to call for the 3 dice stress roll for having a whole herd of ghost cattle stempede toward you....<br/><br/>"Murray, is that you?" asks Chloe.  And yes, it certainly is, as even with her cool die she blows the roll and suffers complete nuclear breakdown.  "They said they sent you to a farm" sobs Chloe.<br/> <br/>Blue Rose also fails her stress roll and gets flipped into the air by a longhorn.  She lands on the beast's back and rides it for a while, bucking-bronco style, before she gets thrown off and (she wanted to be sure I mentioned this in the report) rips her trench coat!  Zounds! <br/> <br/>At this point, clucking is heard from the freezer.  Hmm.  What else was on the menu tonight?<br/> <br/>With her teammates indisposed, and another threat seemingly on the way as yes, ghost chickens have flown out and are pecking around the kitchen, Ivanova readies her Russian silver-laced lasso ("we do eet like this in Mos-COW") and as each cow is lassoed it *poofs* and disappears.  <br/><br/>At this point, oinking is heard from the freezer.  Oh, right, yes -- porkchops on the menu.  Hmm.  Wonder what else was on the menu tonight?<br/><br/>Blue Rose confesses that she was watching the Discovery Channel last week and saw a show about putting chickens to sleep by petting them a certain way.  So as she picks up and hold each one and pets it *poof* it disappears.  She also confesses that she saved an apple from her lunch and throws that to a ghost pig who is wandering about.  She wants to hit it it right in the mouth so it will look like a luau pig roast, but her aim is off and she bops him in the ear and the pig goes wandering off looking for it.  (This will come back later)<br/> <br/>At this point, a massive thumpity-thump-thump is heard from the freezer.   Hmm.  What else was on the menu tonight -- rabbit stew!<br/><br/>Yes, it's the Giant Ghost Rabbit from their very first mission (which, I remind you, only came about because Alexandra/Ivanova came up with it during character creation!)<br/><br/>3 stress checks all around and Chloe drops to 1 Athletics. <br/><br/>The Rabbit is looking big and mean and scary.  Chloe leaps to the confessional and says "While inititally it took a while to figure out how to vanquish the GGR the first time around, ever since I have been carrying around holy water and carrot cake in little Tupperware containers".  ()Lol - of course - how else would you get rid of a giant ghost rabbit?)<br/> <br/>So Chloe states confidently "I've got this."  She whips out the holy water and carrot cake, looks up at the rabbit, looks down at the holy water and carrot cake and says "ummm..." (With her Athletics down to 1, she doesn't have much of a chance).  Ivanova, seeing the situation (and after a quick detour by the GM to  explain the mechanics behind lending dice to another player), backflips over to Chloe, Chloe does a fair job of handing off the carrot cake (thanks to a "4" loaned by Ivanova) and finally Ivanova leaps up and thrusts the carrot cake into the bunny's mouth.  *poof!*  With that final "6" rolled for backflipping her way into vanquishing the rabbit, Ivanova earns the last 2 franchise dice neeeded.<br/><br/>At this point I was ready to explain the post-game phase but the players just kept going!  They went up to Chef Ramsey's office just in time to hear him shout "It's not GOOD enough!"  The door slams open and a chef hurries out.  It turns out he's the sous chef and he's just been fired.  The Inspectres enter the office.<br/><br/>Ramsey looks up and says, "Chloe, is it you?"  Ding, ding, ding!  Guess whose restaurant Chloe had previously burned down!  Ramsey gives Chloe a second chance and she performs adequately though not spectacularly.  Neverheless, by the end of the night she has an "Fair" relationship with Ramsey so he might turn up in future adventures.  After all, he knows a lot of people!<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, Blue Rose runs home (literally) and Ivanvoa starts home on Chloe's moped - though NOT engaging the rocket engines.  On her way she gets a call from Dimitri that the military vehicle is repaired and by the way he's located a, and I quote from the player here, "super-secret dual satellite Russian military phone for the office" so that in the future clients can CALL them instead of having to drop by.  Because "Who ya gonna call?  Not the Inspectres because they don't have a phone" just doesn't make for a catchy theme song.<br/><br/>And so the credits roll over a montage of Blue Rose chilling in the Inspectres office with some cheesecake and Ivanova getting the call from Dmitri.  There's a brief black screen and the camera comes up on Chez Ramsey Ramsey as Chloe, looking exhausted, exits the building through the double-doors where the episode began.  She walks down the long red carpet (successfully installed before the Grand Opening) and says "Guys?  Guys?  They LEFT me here???"  She sees the ghost pig grazing by the sign to the restaurant, sighs, says "come on, buddy" and starts leading the ghost pig home using caramel apples as bait.   <br/><br/>Finally, as the credits finish, a Russian military vehicle driven by Dmitri pulls up next to her and offers her a ride home  ("Dmitri, is that you?").  (This is described as being like the scene in Ferris Bueller where the principal gets on the bus at the end of the movie) <br/> <br/>Finis!  And a quick wrap-up of how the payment works.  Chloe goes home early for the weekend to recover, Blue Rose takes a week off to study with her katana teacher and Ivanova just takes an afternoon off.  The library card is definitely re-loaded because no one is strong in Academics.<br/><br/>What can I say?  An unqalified success in role-playing with 5 minutes prep work and 2 players who have never even role-played before?  Yup!  Inspectres just does that!   <br/><br/>What did I learn?  Rule One -- no, excuse me -- LAW ONE OF INSPECTRES: Have a chair for the confessional.  I cannot overstate how much this simple device helped to guide the play.  As soon as someone moved, everyone else turned to the chair expectantly.  It was brilliant.<br/><br/>Surprises?  Holy cats did my daughter surprise me!  She loved the confessional, grasped the concept immediately (I think having the Scooby Doo reference really helped here, and I did take a little extra time explaining it to her) and put it to good use right off the bat.  And some of her confessionals weren't really - they could have just been stated in character - but whatever! She got the concept and ran with it.  And she was the only one to use any dice off of the cards (with a little reminder from Dad that those dice were available for anyone to use).<br/><br/>It was interesting that while my 12 year old daughter leapt into the game, my sister with her prior experience with D&amp;D held back a little, waiting for the story to happen.  But once she got that SHE was the one making the story, she loved it.  She said afterward that "It's so much more fun to make up your equipment as you go as you need it"<br/><br/>So, a big thank you to all Inspectres players who have posted Actual Play anywhere for me to learn from  and to Jared for writing such a kick-ass game! <br/><br/>Best, <br/>Nicholas                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448532/#Comment_448532" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-14T18:05:49+00:00" title="September 14, 2015  6:05PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What a wonderful write-up!
