So when I found Graham Walmsley's impro advices on <a href="http://www.catchyourhare.com/journal/?cat=4" rel="nofollow">Catch your hare</a> I was extra interested and I read all of them . Then I turned to Johnstone's books, "Impro" and "Impro for storytellers" that Graham presented. And last week, when I received it, I re-read everything Graham wrote in PLAY UNSAFE.<br/><br/>Last saturday, with my brother-in-law Fran\xe7ois as a player, I decided to try it with Eric Provost's <a href="http://redboxhack.blogspot.com/2007/10/pdf-of-thing.html" rel="nofollow">Red Box Hack</a> and deliberatly made minimal preparation for the game. I only used some randomly rolled oracles from Vincent Baker's game "In A Wicked Age". But unlike last time, I didn't try to wrap them all in a kind of backstory. I only kept them for the images they waked in me and for some Jack Vance and Lyonesse-like flair they had. Man, I realy dig those oracles !<br/><br/>I jumped into the game with only a strong image for the intro scene. It was one of the visuals that Vincent's oracle had stired in me : Gontran, Fran\xe7ois' character, was following an old crumbling viaduc in a white hot summer countryside. The road stretched among ripe fields and in the distance you could see a village in a landscape of hills. I let him describe his character and the way he coped with the heat, not wearing his heavy armor and all. This was a plateform and the calm start was welcome. But it needed something to shake it, a "tilt". And so came an angry peasants mob in the village and the begining of a tax revolt. And the game started like this. Of course there were also fairies, monsters and a mysterious revel under the star lit sky.<br/><br/>There's a exciting sensation in the fact to run the game without having everything writen down. You can almost feel like if your are free falling and sometimes you're able to control the fall and glide. No joke.<br/>This is how it went : I used strong images to set the tone and send the game rolling. When Fran\xe7ois asked questions or suggested the existence of things, I almost always said "yes" and used the idea to feed the next five minutes of play. Then when the new thing had come to a stall, I sent in the game the first idea I had to disturb the routine. Then I searched a way to justify it. It was like :<br/>Fran\xe7ois : "I search for a cavern."<br/>Me : "After some search, you find one."<br/>[Exploration of the cave follows]<br/>Me : "You hear a splash, like a body falling into water."<br/>Fran\xe7ois : "Does it seems like a beast ?"<br/>Me : "You see scales on a long tail"...<br/>[First encounter with the monster ensues]<br/>Fran\xe7ois : "I go out of the cave".<br/>Me : "You see a young man, dressed like a warrior, with a lance, a shield and most of all, he has a lion at his side" (And I thought : "why did I say that now ?").<br/><br/>And so on....<br/><br/>The advices I found specialy usefull were :<br/>- hold ideas lightly : I had some images provided by the oracles and some went into the game, some didn't.<br/>- build on other people ideas and don't block : at times, it was realy evident that Fran\xe7ois expected some things to happen. It would have been no fun to throw them away and block them. The cave with the lizard monster was born like that.<br/>- don't delay the important adversity : Fran\xe7ois realy wanted to wait for the first (improvised) monster in the cave. At first, I tried to delay and convince him to come back later. Then I thought "Why wait ?" and remembered Graham's advice. And I sent the monster. And the fight was great, because the RBH has fun fight rules. And we started something else.<br/>- when you don't know what to do, be obvious and bring in your first idea and hope you'll justify it later. The young warrior with the lion. It was an oracle I rolled but it had absolutly zero reason to be there. Another one, near the end of the game : Gontran had just killed his fairy knight opponent. Now what ? First obvious idea : "you hear a baby crying." And here comes a changeling...<br/>- reincorporation : during the course of the game, we discovered that the young lion warrior came to honor some ancient pact with the fairies of the glade. And later in the game, Fran\xe7ois himself, without having read anything about impro or reincorporation, brought back the monster in the story, when he maimed a body to fool the fairies into believing that it was the lizard that killed their knight. I was amazed how the improvised monster came back at this moment. The satisfaction and completion feeling that this simple thing produced allowed us to finish the game soon after that with only a kind of calm epilogue.<br/><br/>In the end, we've had a great deal of fun and when we looked at the clock we saw that it was only 00:46 AM. We only played 2 hours and we had about the same story fun than with a cool movie of the same length. A that was because everything came naturaly into the game without blocking and without delaying, in an organic way. And of course because of the fun rules of the RBH (did I say I was Eric's greatest fan ?).<br/><br/>I am also very gratefull to Fran\xe7ois because in spite of the 3 hours sleep he had the night before the game, he displayed quite a bit of energy. He was realy present at the table and I used a lot of the things he said to direct and feed the game. And in the end it's his idea that made the game a wonderfull whole. I want to do it again ! Can't wait !<br/><br/>Later I'll tell how Johnstone's impro advices helped me draw from imagination again and saved my life. But that's another story...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113753/#Comment_113753" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-12T09:15:17+00:00" title="December 12, 2007  9:15AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 12, 2007 9:16AM by Graham.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's brilliant!

No joke.</blockquote>\nThat's exactly the sensation I got when I used to do improv.<br/><br/>It's fascinating that you let the player do the platform, but you (the GM) did the tilt. Now you mention it, that's probably how it'll usually happen. It could happen the other way: the GM sets up a non-dramatic situation and the player provides the tilt, describing his character coming in to bring the drama. <br/><br/>But, now I think about it, whoever does the platform, someone else should probably do the tilt.<br/><br/>Neat.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114256/#Comment_114256" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-14T00:28:49+00:00" title="December 14, 2007 12:28AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat!
