Really. Srsly.<br/><br/><b>OBSESSION STAGE</b><br/><br/>Hey, you, you Hikikomori Otaku loser! You make me sick with the horrible Negima H doujin you wrote, the stupid VN based on an obscure ass RPG that you swore would come out a month ago, the Star Wars fanfilm club you were a Jedi for!<br/><br/>Get a fucking life! You're never going to get anywhere! Shit, you've spent seven years as a worthless ronin with your 'buds,' it's time to move on from your pathetic little fandoms. Have sex with a real girl, for chrissake, not something 2-d... and no, it doesn't count if she was dressed as Yokho at the time!<br/><br/>You seriously think that getting your fancomics out matters? That you can maintain a real relationship? A real job?<br/><br/>Prove it.<br/><br/><i><b>This is how.</b></i><br/><br/><i>My most abject apologies for this, but yeah, it's a hack that's a whole lot LESS Gundam and Evangelion, a whole lot more Genshiken and Otaku No Video.</i><br/><br/><b>CHARACTER CREATION:</b><br/><br/>Pretty much like regular Bliss Stage, actually. Bliss becomes Obsession, of course; and the Resistance becomes 'the Circle,' an association of friends and lovers bound together by a single fandom and their fanworks for it.<br/><br/>The Pilots become Artists doing fanwork, the Anchors become Mundanes - friends or lovers that don't share that interest, and have more of a proverbial Life than you do and keep you going to classes and so on. Name Mundanes after lost childhood <i>mentors</i>, but otherwise the rules are the same.<br/><br/>Innocent Sweethearts and Eager Young Artists are as the Bliss Stage versions.<br/><br/>Rising Heroes and Seasoned Vets are renamed Closet Otaku and Industry Burnouts, respectively, but are mechanically the same; Closet Otaku seem fairly normal and likeable to most people, but people who know them and who don't share their interest (and have spent their Relationships on the Closet Otaku...) are all SHUT UP ABOUT THAT FUCKING TABLETOP RPG ALREADY (note: not autobiographical, rly). Industry Burnouts, on the other hand, are always adults, and have always tried and failed to Make In in the mainstream industry - couldn't hack it as an inbetweener, a codemonkey, a sound guy, whatevs.<br/><br/>Devoted Lovers MUST have their 5/3 to another fan, never to their Mundane. Closet Mundanes are as Carefree Hedonists, can distribute 2 additional Intimacy points, and lose 1 Trust in The Fandom; they're just here for the chicks and/or pizza.<br/><br/>And oh yes.<br/><br/><b>RELATIONSHIP TO THE FANDOM</b><br/>You all have The Fandom in common, and have a Relationship to it. This replaces the Authority Figure; the GM represents it by having new episodes/websites/whatever come out periodically and calling for Fandom Interludes once each Interlude cycle.<br/><br/>In addition, anyone can declare that the Interlude they just had was in fact more about being fannish than about connecting as human beings, and have their Interludes judged on THAT basis.<br/><br/>The Intimacy chart for The Fandom is a little different, of course. Int 3 is when The Fandom inspires Real Emotion, Int 4 is when it's Real Passion (got in a physical altercation or spoke of Peverse Sexual Lust and meant it), and Int 5... well, I leave that up to you. The example of someone dressing as a character, not because you're kinky but because you want to sex up that character, is a good one, as would be something involving body pillows or wet dreams. You pervert.<br/><b><br/>PROJECTS</b><br/>As missions. Be a LOT more freeform about Relationship manifestations and do Stupid Time Tricks with this. Be creative in descriptions of Trauma, Terror, Harm and (You Are) Dead (To Me).<br/><br/>Good Projects include "Get It Done And To The Printer," "Find A Job," "Graduate From Art School," "Make A Profit In The Dealer's Room."<br/><br/>The first Project is always "Find A Job/ Get That Job" or similar.<br/><br/>Blissing Out is becoming a total irredeemable hikikomori, of course.<br/><br/><b>HOPES<br/></b><br/>Of course I have some, but not enough.<br/><br/>I hope we can get a good job<br/>I hope we're still friends after all this<br/>I hope the original creator likes our work<br/>I hope our stuff becomes canon<br/>I hope we can do original work<br/>I hope the original company hires us<br/>I hope we graduate<br/>I hope I'll get married someday<br/><br/>Things like that.<br/><br/>Comments?  I actually want to flesh this out into an actual game - what do you think of this seed of an idea here?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
