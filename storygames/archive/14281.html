I'm wondering what rules folks finally settled on. Did you keep the rolling with the possibility of failure during Unrelated Actions? Did you port over the Automatic Augments from <i>HeroQuest</i>? Did you keep the roll, but remove failure? Or did you play them as written? (As I've found many people did after fiddling with the <i>HeroQuest</i> rules and then deciding they actually liked the <i>Hero Wars</i> rules better.)<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324267/#Comment_324267" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-13T03:06:44+00:00" title="May 13, 2011  3:06AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2011 3:07AM by Neil.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used automatic augments from before HeroQuest came out: I just couldn't be bothered with rolling for a whole bunch of augments that did little to move the story onwards ("Yes, I know your PC is Strong and Brave and Trained By A Kralorelan Master and ... just add +5 to your Sword ability").

(In <i>HeroQuest 1</i>, you divide the Ability by 10, rounding up at .5, and that's the Augment. Obviously, it takes a lot of the risk -- and potential of a bigger Augmentation -- off the table.)<br/><br/>The ability to fail an Augmentation roll (and so get a penalty) is in the <i>Hero Wars</i> rules as written.

We were all Heortlings, two Clan Geatling members and a clanless spirit-talker; our clan had been run off our land by Lunars, and we were currently in court for stealing cattle from a neighboring clan, the Gevalti while on the run. <br/>Play was limited to a couple of establishing simple-contests, and then a sweet extended-contest between Hrothgar (the lawspeaker of Orlanth Rex) and the neighboring clan's rep, a jerk named Skaldi. <br/>I, a spear-maiden of Vinga from Hrothgar's clan, jumped into the conversation early on to complain about how the Gevalti should have taken us in, should have helped us avenge our dead and get back our stolen children from the Lunars. <br/>Ildish, a local spirit-talker, was totally on our side; he's not a fan of the Gevalti whatsoever, and he clucked his tongue and stirred up his followers a few times to get the crowd on our side. <br/>Hrothgar totally put Skaldi in his place and declared that, obviously, the Gevalti were collaborating with the Lunars, up to and including the child-trafficking. From the look on Skaldi's face, it was all true. <br/><br/>Mechanically, we were basically doing this:<br/>- think about the situation for a sec<br/>- look at my sheet for an appropriate skill<br/>- announce what I'm doing<br/>- GM says, "want to augment?"<br/>- we try that sometimes, sometimes we don't<br/>- we announce the outcome of our rolls, both good and bad, and the GM adds on to that with his own description<br/><br/>The AP stuff in extended contests was amazing - it made it super-obvious who had the momentum, and while there was a tiny bit of "okay, let's interpret these numbers", the fact that in any given exchange there was obviously a winner and a loser meant that we could just combine the ongoing fiction with an us/them victory to keep play going smoothly. The AP interplay totally fed into the fiction well because of its binary simplicity. Betting points also ramped up the excitement quite a bit, and every bet on each side was meaningful. <br/><br/>This scene was basically all about Hrothgar, a Law Speaker - I, the Vingan warrior, chimed in a few times to back him up, as did Ildish the Spirit-Talker. We augmented ourselves and Hrothgar, and then cheered him on during the extended contest. At the end, Hrothgar took Skaldi's wineskin and drained it, then sent a mute boy to hand it back to him. <br/><br/>Our goal was to stake our lawful claim on Gevalti hospitality, and we did so by shaming them down off their high horse. It was pretty amazing. <br/>(Come to think of it, I'm not certain that we actually augmented one another's rolls. I think I got confused because I'd augment my own roll and then use said roll to <i>assist</i> Hrothgar - not the same thing, I suppose.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324341/#Comment_324341" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-13T12:04:16+00:00" title="May 13, 2011 12:04PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2011 12:25PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!<br/><br/>I did a one shot at a game convention using HeroQuest with Heortlings.<br/><br/>Tthe PCs were an father and his two, young-men sons -- with simmering to boiling inter-family tension. <br/><br/>The father had taken a young bride, carrying the father's child, had chosen to fall in with the Lunar faith.

The fact that they ended up working together was kind of a surprise to me.<br/><br/>For me, this is the kind of situation/relationships I'd want for a Glorantha setting... bound but elastic, so you don't know where the loyalties will stretch to, or back to, or snap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324385/#Comment_324385" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-13T19:34:31+00:00" title="May 13, 2011  7:34PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2011 7:38PM by soviet.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a big fan of automatic augments, and I like them to see heavy use during play. As has been pointed out already, the problem with this approach is that conflicts can easily get bogged down by people trawling their character sheets for every last augment. My game Other Worlds is kind of a riff on my favourite parts of HQ (among other things!), and this is how I handled the issue:<br/><br/>You can only use 3 auto-augments per conflict. This is enough to add an interesting spin on things but not so much that play slows down as a result. However, some conflicts are so important or character-focused that you really will want to take the time to savour every last detail of the situation. So, you can spend a point of metagame currency to ignore this limit for a specific conflict. <br/><br/>The advantage of doing it this way is that it introduces a clear creative constraint for most situations but also puts the power to go beyond it directly into the player's hands. I don't think HQ1-style self-regulation quite works in this regard, and giving the GM some sort of 'plot/character significance' veto would be inappropriate for the style of play I'm interested in. Charging for the privilege of bringing in all these detailed augments not only limits how often it will happen but also, crucially, gives the player a kind of permission to really go to town when he does decide it's appropriate without feeling like he is doing something wrong and getting an unfair advantage. It also acts as a pretty cool Chris Chinn-style flag of interest to the rest of the group.<br/><br/>I do have a mechanism for rolled augments in the form of sub-conflicts, but they're generally reserved for augments that can potentially go wrong and actively cause the player new problems rather than just failing to work somehow.

It's pretty similar to rolling both a skill and a stat together in a dice pool, even if the math is pretty different (I imagine). <br/><br/>Chris,<br/>I think we used augmentation failures as a further coloring of how well one's chosen tactic suited the task at hand. It made the most sense when trying to augment others' rolls, since we could just say, "I interject in this way, and it makes things worse."<br/>As for augmenting one's own action, if you fail the augment roll. It seems to kind of turn the ultimate success into a chance thing, rather than due to the character's skill.<br/><br/>For instance, it'd make sense for my Orlanthi warrior, being a horsewoman, to augment her Spear Fighting with her Riding skill. If she blows the augment roll, what happens in the fiction? There's no obvious answer - maybe that's a feature, not a bug, but I'm not as keen on trying to imagine that each time I roll funny. That was an issue I sort of had with Dogs - the freeform traits slow down the process of determining what happens. <br/>The point isn't that I <i>can't</i> imagine combining those two traits, it's that the pressure is on at the point of play to figure that out. <br/><br/>[Depending on how badly she blows the augment roll, you could say she goes flying out of the saddle and nails her foe with the spear, right in the heart. She's eating dust, but she did it.

(I'm addressing is the rules in the book, not the cool fixes that people have found, and trying to sort it out, digging in deep to make sure I'm not missing something before I start tinkering.)<br/><br/>So, after reading all these terrific posts and going back into the rules, what I'm seeing is a lot of different <i>little</i> problems, all connected but discrete.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Task/Conflict Resolution Problem</span><br/><br/>1) In <i>Hero Wars</i>, getting an Augment is done during an "Unrelated Action." This <i>is</i> an action, a specific something your character is doing during a discrete amount of time during the Extended Contest. You pass on making a roll against another opponent when your turn in the round comes up. <br/><br/>2) I think the term here--Unrelated Action--is horrific. If my Heortling warrior is rearing her horse around to charge at an opponent as her Unrelated Action (her action, while disengaged from an opponent) to Augmenting an upcoming Spear roll, clearly it's related to the conflict. <br/><br/>3) The problem, I'm beginning to see, is that the Augmentation roll, because is not cast against an opponent has slipped us from Conflict Resolution into Task Resolution. Thus, we all try to waffle around the problems that Task Resolution can engender: Rolls that do nothing or fumble that lead to a dead stop, rather than failures that are interesting and push the fiction forward, regardless of a failure. <br/><br/>4) The fact that this is happening isn't that surprising given that the game was published in 2000 and the issues and properties of Conflict and Task resolution were only beginning to be nailed down. (I'm also pretty sure Laws isn't particularly interested in the distinction from the design I've seen since.)<br/><br/>5) So, an example:<br/><br/>The Heortling warrior is disengaged from her opponent and, in an Unrelated Action, rides her horse back for a charge against an opponent for the next round. If she succeeds in the roll it means she set up her charge properly. If she fails and gets a penalty on her roll, it means she stumbled through the ranks of her comrades, dodging them and making a bad attack. This is all cool and makes sense. It is part of the fiction and we can all see it clearly. <br/><br/>But in doing this, what is she rolling? Is it a Task resolution roll using her Riding skill? Not quite, because she's rolling against the Augment Bonus Chart. It actually is a Conflict, but the Conflict is against <i>a table in the rule book</i> -- not a piece of the fiction. <br/><br/>I'm gong to be bold and say This is a Big Fucking Deal. The Augmentation roll is a weird hybrid of Task resolution and Conflict resolution. I'm pretty sure that's what we're dancing around and trying to fix.<br/><br/>6) I'd say that this, first and foremost, is where the problem comes in. And this is where the desire for Automatic Augments comes in as a fix. With Auto-Augments, we get around the problem of the Player making Task rolls anymore (which lead to all sorts of "How do I justify whiffs? What does failure mean to the fiction? Do things just stop?" problems) and we slip past the problem of Conflict roll against something outside of the fiction. Instead of a roll, we grab some quality of the Character that matters to the conflict and apply it. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fiction Interacting with the Rolls</span><br/><br/>The other problem, as I see it, is what Vincent Baker refers to as the "Right Pointing Arrows" -- point where the result of rules impacts the fiction is in ways that actually turn the fiction in specific and meaningful ways. Some games have rules that do this, and other games don't. In the game that don't, you can use all the mechanics to resolve a conflict, "paste" some fictional color on top of dice rolls or results, but whatever happens in the rules doesn't really change the fiction in ways that will affect the next roll. Vincent uses In A Wicked Age as an example of a game lacking right pointing arrows <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=427" rel="nofollow">in this discussion</a>.<br/><br/>1) So, let's say we <i>don't</i> demand that a Character remove himself from the conflict into an Unrelated Action and actually do specific activity to justify the roll for an Augment -- which, from what I've been reading from around the Internet, is what a lot of people did. The Players just called for a chance to roll an Augment, the roll was made, and then  the roll either succeeded or failed, with results ranging from "Awesome!" to "Oh, fuck, I've got a penalty on my next roll."<br/><br/>2) The problem is, of course, that if the Character doesn't describe what fictionally happened to make the roll, we know that <i>something</i> is going on, but we have no way of connecting it to what's happening in the fiction. What then does failure mean? We know what success means -- "I get a bonus!" and with that bonus in hand, we're happy enough not to think about the fact that we also have no idea what a success means. But with a whiff it sticks in the craw because we have a penalty but we suddenly don't know why. "I was using my riding skill! What went wrong?" Well, it's kind of late to figure that out without having to spool back a bit and paste on some sort of justification.<br/><br/>3) More significantly, however, whether it's success or failure. Another character can't grab hold of whatever happened in a fictional context and make a statement based on the result. <br/><br/>In other words, something did happen (a riding skill was made) but actually nothing happened (it wasn't represent in the fiction in a significant way. We're jumping next into the Spear Fighting roll which will either succeed or fail all on its own, independent of what happened with the Augment roll. So, we're making rolls that never stitch into the fiction in any meaningful way.<br/><br/>4) An example of successful stitching:<br/><br/>Same as before: The Heortling warrior is in an Unrelated Action, pulling her horse around for a charge on an opponent, making a Riding roll as an Augment for her Spear Fighting. That's her action for the round, while all the other characters are doing other things (making opposed rolls against opponents or their own Unrelated Actions).<br/><br/>The Player makes a roll and ends up with a Minor Defeat -- she's going to have a penalty equal to the Augment she was shooting for on her Spear Fighting in the next round. So, the immediate question is, What Happened?<br/><br/>The Game Master (or the Player?) says, "As she sweeps around for a charge on the Lunar soldier, she comes up through a line of Heortling infantry. She pulls the reigns, dodging between them, but slips off her saddle as the horse bucks her side to side. She's still got her spear, half-hanging on to the pommel, off-balance but charging toward toward that fucking Lunar to gut him."<br/><br/>So, this works. We have the roll, we have the fiction in context. And, significantly, the fiction matters in the next round.<br/><br/>If in the next round the Heortling warrior makes a successful Spear Fighting roll, it'll be described as pulling off the attack despite being half off balance. <i>But</i> if the Lunar infantryman wins, he can easily slip in, "I yank her off her horse as she rides past," since it was already established in the fiction that she was off-balance. <br/><br/>5) Now, how might a Relationship work in Unrelated Actions (how do they become "actions")? I think that's tricker -- but doable! In an Unrelated Action, the character touches the broach his dead wife gave him before he attacks her killer -- and so on. Essentially, given how Unrelated Actions are described I'm seeing them less as Unrelated Actions and more like Spotlight Shots --where we get the camera on the Character doing something cool or emotional or specific before leaping into a Conflict resolution roll. What does success or failure mean? Exactly, as far as I can tell, what Trait or Passion rolls would be in <i>Pendragon</i> -- we learn the definition of touching the broach by the result of the roll. If it goes well, the Character is inspired. If he finds out, we find out that he's touching it because he's remember how he failed her.<br/><br/>6) When we go into the next round and the Character makes the Conflict roll against his wife's killer, if the killer wins he can say, "And I strike the broach from the Heortling's chest as my sword strikes down and draws blood." We're building on the fiction that his built by the rules. Which certainly is how I like to play.<br/><br/>7) So, I'm saying if someone is attempting an Augment it isn't just a thing that happens. It's a big deal. I'm saying that if the Heortling husband stops to touch his broach, it's not a little deal - it's a BIG DEAL. It's the moment before or during a fight when the protagonist really checks in and finds out where his heart is. It's Luke listening to Obi Wan during the final run on the Death Star. By keeping Augments something rolled, during Unrelated Actions, you're keeping the Augment attempts significant, special and worth of specific screen-time... which I <i>think</i> is how they were meant to be used.<br/><br/>8) Thus, the issue of sewing the of the rolls into the fiction is horribly problematic if one doesn't do it. But the rules seemed to suggest that this is exactly what the rule say we should be doing.<br/><br/>9) Now, how to handle this with Simple Contests, I do not know. The rules seem to suggest that this isn't going to happen, but that seems sad.<br/><br/>[continued]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324443/#Comment_324443" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T10:32:40+00:00" title="May 14, 2011 10:32AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2011 11:06AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [continued from previous post]<br/><br/>Finally, there are mechanical issues in the rules as written:<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Problem with Getting into an Unrelated Action</span><br/><br/>1) The rules say that to do an Augment, one must be in an Unrelated Action. To be in an Unrelated Action, one can't be in a conflict with another character for that round.<br/><br/>2) The rules imply, in how they are structured and in the text, that if you <i>are</i> engaged with an enemy and want to perform an Unrelated Action, you're going to have to disengage with the enemy. To do this you're gong to have to make a <i>roll</i> to disengage. <br/><br/>3) Let's think about this for a moment: According to the rules, if I'm fighting someone and want to Augment, not only do I have to give up an action in the conflict to make a roll in the Unrelated Action, but I'm going to first have to make a roll to disengage! This is not only a lot of steps but a lot of <i>risk</i> as there are now several rolls: first you roll to see if you disengaged (you might fail and lose a round attacking); and then a roll for the Augment (which might, ultimately, lead you to a penalty)!<br/><br/>That's... kind of crazy.<br/><br/>4) My guess is a lot of people simply glossed over this aspect of the rules. (I know I did. I had to go back several times, thinking each time I read the rules, "Really?")<br/><br/>5) On the other hand,<i> there's no way to get around this</i>. Given the way Extended Contests are structure, you're either in a contested action with an opponent or you're in an Unrelated Action. There's simply no way to make a Augment Roll while you are engaged with an opponent, because you need to be in an Unrelated Action!<br/><br/>6) The quick fix everyone found, I think, was to disengage Augments from Unrelated Actions. Thus, you made the Augment roll as part of the actual contested action -- a pre-roll to see if you got a bonus.<br/><br/>7) But once you did this, there was suddenly no screen-time left for focusing on the action required for the Augment. Or, at least, it got really compressed. Because clearly the Augment roll was a kind of lesser roll that only prevented you from getting to the roll that really mattered -- the contested roll with the opponent. This, of course, clearly blows the significance of the action required to justify the Augment out of the water -- and it's just a couple of more steps to simply getting rid of the action completely. And then we're wondering why we're rolling at all. And then we go to Auto-Augments.<br/><br/>8) Given the structure of the rules, I really don't know how to make going for an Augment enticing enough to really come into use as written. And this, again, simply renders the use of Augments during a Simple Contest impossible. One is either doing one thing or another thing as an action -- a contested roll or an Unrelated Action. To compress the time frame is to engender all the complications of the first two sections of this post.<br/><br/>9) This is a <i>huge</i> mechanical problem. If you're a player and want to do an Unrelated Action with your Character, which requires you making a roll outside of any contested action, and I'm the GM and have a character attack you... you've either made sure you're really out of the fight (which is why the rules require a disengage roll, to really nail that down) or somehow I'm engaging you with my character, blocking you from doing the action. I just can't shake the feeling that there were some last minute shenanigans in the game text before publication... But I also see the same problems in both editions of HeroQuest, so I don't know.

In a set piece you chain a small sequence of sub-conflicts together until you've escalated the situation enough to justify a big finale. Sub-conflicts are really just normal conflict rolls with smaller stakes - they resolve a detail of the overall conflict rather than the whole thing. I've tried very hard to make sure it's not possible to descend back into task resolution like HQ's chained and extended contests can.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite><br/><br/>I do have a mechanism for rolled augments in the form of sub-conflicts, but they're generally reserved for augments that can potentially go wrong and actively cause the player new problems rather than just failing to work somehow. 'Roll to see if anything happens' is not a meme I'm very fond of TBH.</blockquote>\nYou just touched on the one things that<i>really</i>bugs me about playing with the rolled Augments -- how to make failure interesting. After all, the Character didn't fail the<i>action</i>yet -- and still might succeed!<br/><br/>So, how does that play out -- and specifically affect the fiction?<br/><br/>All the conflicts in my game - including sub-conflicts - generate new abilities. Depending on the nature of the situation, <b>either</b> the winner gets a free temporary ability (that lasts for one session), or the loser gets a new flaw (which can be temporary or permanent depending on the severity of the defeat). So to do an augment as a rolled sub-conflict you would just have to articulate the stakes in terms of potential gains and losses. Does my fierce battle cry inspire my friends or attract more enemies? Does my risky full-power turbo-boost put me ahead of the other podracers or start a fire in my aft engines? <br/><br/>So, in a set piece to resolve a Wild West gun duel, character A declares the first sub-conflict. They decide they're going to try to stare out character B. If they lose they gain a flaw (I dunno, <i>Intimidated</i> maybe). If they win they can either gain a temporary ability for themselves (<i>Psychological Advantage</i>) or give Character B a flaw (<i>Scared of Character A</i>). Character B then gets to declare their own subconflict - maybe they'll go for the quickdraw, maybe they'll try to gain a superior firing position, whatever. The two sides alternate sub-conflicts for a while, each time generating a new flaw or ability to give the events of the fiction a mechanical representation, until the situation reaches a natural tipping point and we move to final resolution. All of the abilities and flaws you've generated via your sub-conflicts can be brought into this final roll, particularly if you've spent your Spotlight Point to ignore the normal limit of 3 supporting abilities. I've found it works pretty well in practice - it certainly feels like a much more natural way to escalate/resolve things than action points ever did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324472/#Comment_324472" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T14:36:30+00:00" title="May 14, 2011  2:36PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Christopher, I have a possibly related HW/HQ question for you, since you're already spending so much brainpower on the game:  What's the deal with Flaws?  Perhaps I'm missing something in the rules, but I've never been quite clear on how exactly they're meant to work, mechanically.  I don't recall HW having much to say on the issue and I haven't read the relevant section of HQ1 yet, and HQ2 seems to imply they should serve as the Resistance for whatever action the PC is doing that makes the Flaw come into play.  That makes them almost like a negative Augment, which seems to run into the same problem this thread's noting, of the immediacy and drama of the action being hurt by the table spending as much or more time resolving its color as we do resolving its actual consequence.<br/><br/>I really like the idea of, say, your vows to Humakt or whoever interfering with the personal promises you have sworn to keep, but boiling that down to, "Welp, roll your Friendship with Hrothgar 13 and I'll roll your Initiate of Humakt 17 to see if you feel like doing it" seems very unsatisfying and somehow not in keeping with the HW/HQ philosophy, but damned if I can put my finger on exactly why.<br/><br/>(incidentally, I ran the one-shot Zac's been talking about, but I don't really have any insights on the augmentation issue, since I'm in the same boat as you, flipping through all three editions trying to tease out which version of what rule works best in play.  I let the uninvolved PCs lend aid via augments instead of lending AP because this was only the second time I've run the game in the 11 years I've owned it and didn't want to bog down the session's first extended conflict by giving all three players full AP pools and bidding rights.  In hindsight that might not have been an issue, since the acting player's very first roll was a risky bid and critical success that immediately put the AP pools at NPC 4 vs PC 40)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324475/#Comment_324475" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T15:09:41+00:00" title="May 14, 2011  3:09PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite><br/>Were the auto-augments for both Simple and Extended conflicts?<br/>Did people total them up at the start of a conflict?<br/>Could they add more if they became appropriate during an Extended conflict?</blockquote>\nI allow augments for simple and extended contests.

Is the character "Hot-Headed"? Awesome. Forget the word "Flaw," write down "Hot-Headed" and get on with it. The question is (for me) "How does a character go about doing something?" If he's in a king's court and loses his temper to strike someone's head off, use the Hot-Headed as an Augment to the sword stroke. Full stop.<br/><br/>As for Relationships -- they're "flaws" when they get a character in trouble. In your example, the fact that a character might have competing allegiances on the character sheet is the point -- and it's enough, in my view. The Player has to look down at that sheet and make a decision. That's it right there. <br/><br/>Later, when he's knee deep in a task or commitment to one of the Relationships, I'll have someone show up from the other Relationship and ask, "What the hell are you doing?" As far as I'm concerned that's the value of a Player writing down conflicting Relationships. He's saying, "Push me on this!." Eventually he might even forgo one of them and delete it from the Character Sheet depending on how the fiction plays out.<br/><br/>But as far as the Relationships and scores go, they're all about the connection/devotion/loyalty the Player Character has to another character. The flaw--if it is one--is that in the fiction the GM can put stress on the PC by putting the character in danger or testing loyalty across a spectrum of Relationships. Being "Devoted to My Son" isn't a "flaw." Again, it's just a Trait. If your no-good son is always getting hauled into court for stealing cows, others might see a Father's devotion to his son as a flaw. But for the father it just <i>is</i>.<br/><br/>The only time I could see using them as some sort of flaw is is we had built up to a big climax and it had been made clear over several session of play that the Player really, really cared about and was digging torn loyalties or something and we came to a big climax where he had to fight someone he was loyal too. I might give the opposition an Auto-Augment based on the PCs relationship score. But, again, I'm addressing the Character's choice of action as affected by the score. The choice is all the Characters. The devotion is still there (it's still a "positive" relationship) which is why the person the PC is loyal to is getting the Auto-Augment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324477/#Comment_324477" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T15:14:53+00:00" title="May 14, 2011  3:14PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: soviet</cite>I'm a big fan of automatic augments, and I like them to see heavy use during play.

To be in an Unrelated Action, one can't be in a conflict with another character for that round.<br/><br/>2) The rules imply, in how they are structured and in the text, that if you<i>are</i>engaged with an enemy and want to perform an Unrelated Action, you're going to have to disengage with the enemy. To do this you're gong to have to make a<i>roll</i>to disengage.</blockquote>\nNot by my reading. The rules give withdrawing as an <i>example</i> of an unrelated action, with information on how to handle it. Other types of unrelated action don't necessitate withdrawal, but by foregoing the opportunity to remove APs from the opponent, you risk bringing your defeat closer. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite><br/>6) The quick fix everyone found, I think, was to disengage Augments from Unrelated Actions. Thus, you made the Augment roll as part of the actual contested action -- a pre-roll to see if you got a bonus.<br/><br/>7) But once you did this, there was suddenly no screen-time left for focusing on the action required for the Augment. Or, at least, it got really compressed. Because clearly the Augment roll was a kind of lesser roll that only prevented you from getting to the roll that really mattered -- the contested roll with the opponent. This, of course, clearly blows the significance of the action required to justify the Augment out of the water -- and it's just a couple of more steps to simply getting rid of the action completely. And then we're wondering why we're rolling at all. And then we go to Auto-Augments.</blockquote>\nI quickly moved to auto-augments for two reasons. First, many augments that people brought in were innate (Strong, Brave, Large, Ugly, Hates Lunars, etc.), so it didn't make sense to narrate them in explicitly every time (and there are only so many ways of narrating them in before everyone gets bored). The other reason was that there were just so bloody many of them. I mean, if you're in a contest your PC cares about and you can't bring in at least 6-8 augments, you're not really trying. Rolls and narration for each of those, for every Simple contest, would just take up too much table time. <br/><br/>So, auto-augments were a pragmatic response to the number of augments, not because of a mismatch between task and conflict resolution.<br/><br/>You may also be getting distracted by the bells and whistles of Extended Contests. When I played HW and HQ, we had one, maybe two, Extended Contests per session, but a dozen or more Simple Contests. Lots of narration for all of those SCs will probably drag. Or you could be aiming to play the game, and engage the mechanics, in a way different from how we knew how several years ago. <br/><br/>But frankly, it's those problems that put me off the HW/HQ system in the end. I was playing in Glorantha again, I'd want to do the drama-style game you're describing. But I'd probably start with the <i>Hot War</i> system. It's got a more manageable number of traits for augmenting and relationships are significant. Personal agendas are great, but I'm not sure what I'd replace factional agendas with: probably community/religious agendas.<br/><br/>Edit: HQ2 has limited augments, and may have fixed the problems I had with HW and HQ1. I've not seen it yet, so I don't know.<br/><br/><br/>As for Flaws, I don't know anyone who used them as-written. Characters have abilities (of whatever type) that sometimes helped, sometimes hindered them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324558/#Comment_324558" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-15T06:33:37+00:00" title="May 15, 2011  6:33AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2011 6:47AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Neil,<br/><br/>I want you to know that I really have no desire to drag you arguments about a game that is 11 years old and that you eventually stopped playing. But if you're game, I'll reply to your points:<br/><br/>1) You're right that Withdrawing is an example of an Unrelated Action! I get it now. I was conflating another game system I play with this one, in which all the characters roll at once. But this is a alternating volley system, so you can Augment instead of committing to an opposed contest when your side's turn comes up. Thanks! That calms me down!<br/><br/>2) On the bottom of page 133 of <i>Hero Wars</i> the rules state, "Abilities may be augmented by one mundane ability, and only once per feat, but can be increased by several different feats. That is, a <i>Swordfighting</i> ability may be augmented by <i>Great Strengt</i>h or <i>Ferocity<i></i></i>, but not both; and by many feats, but not the same feat twice." <br/><br/>So, while multiple Augments are allowed, if one sticks to the "one mundane ability" that severely cuts down the list-making for Augments. Most stacked Augments will come from the special effects of feats--which should have an over the top quality.<br/><br/>3) I appreciate what you're saying about innate Augments --  and think it could be a big problem. And that's why I'd want to keep the number of Augments down (as the rules state). You can describe a character's <i>Great Strength</i> while swinging a sword in a cool way many ways (Homer and Robert E. Howard do it all the time), but Players will also cycle through different Abilities to use as Augments if they only have one, grabbing whichever one makes the most sense coupled with what their imagination is coughing up.<br/><br/>For me, the thing is, "Why does the <i>Great Strength</i> matter <i>right now</i>? Augments, in my view, aren't skills or reformed stat blocks. They are the introduction to the conflict of something that matters to the conflict <i>right now</i>. If there's not some unique play of <i>Great Strength</i> with the <i>Swordfighting</i> at this particular moment, it's not an Augment. (For some reason, my head sees it that way.)<br/><br/>4) I'm going to stick with my concerns about the Augmentation roll being very much a Task roll that suddenly short circuits a cool Conflict resolution system. A player making a roll for his <i>Great Strength</i> against.... what? What is his roll against? A table in a book. There is no opposition in the fiction he's rolling against. It's a Task roll. And that engenders all the failure/whiff factor problems of Task resolution. <br/><br/>This is where my problem with innate Ability Augments kick in: I do this cool description of my armor sliding up and down the muscles of my arms and shoulders as I swing my sword and fail... and what happens? If I fail the penalty goes into my <i>Swordfighting</i> roll... but what happened in the fiction? What does it mean to fail my <i>Great Strength</i> roll? That's pure Task resolution shenanigan and I'm still thinking it through. <br/><br/>My guess is that when someone fails a Augment roll, the opposition (in whatever form) immediately responds with fiction that changes his positioning in some way, "The Lunar ducks low! Getting under your sword swing and moving for you!" The Player with the <i>Great Strength</i> then makes his <i>Swordfighting</i> roll and we find out what happens. I'm assuming I'll be doing the same thing with success. In my view, nailing the rolls down into changes in the fiction positioning is vital to make sure it doesn't just become a "listing of rambling descriptions" but an engagement with every roll as making sense and changing the fiction as the rolls are made.<br/><br/><br/>I don't think I'm getting pulled in by the bells and whistles of the Extended Contests. I think this:<br/><br/>Everyone liked the idea of the Augmentation rules. And one of two things happened, from reports I've seen across the Internet: <br/><br/>People either found a way of house-ruling the concept of Augmentation that worked for them. Or <i>they gave up the game in frustration</i>.<br/><br/>I really have no interest--for myself or for my players--of walking them down a path to frustration. So I think it's worth sorting this out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324574/#Comment_324574" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-15T08:45:56+00:00" title="May 15, 2011  8:45AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, sorry, I came across a bit more tetchy in that post than I really am. It was more a case of warning you about potential pitfalls in your path, so that you didn't get caught up in them. I think you're now aware of where they are, so go right ahead! Apologies for my tone.<br/><br/>You're right about the 'only one mundane augment' rule in HW. That limit was explicitly dropped in HQ1. I was getting confuddled between the two. My bad. I liked the idea of multiple mundane augments in theory, but it didn't work in practice.<br/><br/>I don't think I've ever come across people narrating Augmentations as being changes in fictional position, external to the PC. I think people just assumed that, as the PC was both the source and target of the augmentation, that the narration should concern only the PC. But I like your approach, and I'd really like to hear how it goes. In fact, one example of a rolled augment for Great Strength was Rory Robertson acting out a swordsman planting his stance and making a huge backswing, ready for a devastating blow. It's easy to narrate how that action goes either well or ill for the swordsman.<br/><br/>Oh, one other point. Augments often have very little mechanical effect. HW and HQ has a fine-grained scale and a +1 or +2 on an ability rating has a trivial effect. +10 starts to be significant, and you need a +20 or more to be comfortable of victory. Frank Mitchell has <a href="http://www.frank-mitchell.com/games/hq-prob-table.html" rel="nofollow">a table of HQ probabilities</a> that bear this out. (I've not checked his maths, but it seems about right.) If you want one or two augments to have real mechanical weight, you may need to scale the magnitude of their effects. Or you might be happy with them where they are.<br/><br/><br/>(As for the general point about HW being a better system than HQ1, you're generally right. I think that Greg Stafford didn't really understand the HW system that Robin Laws gave him. I think that large chunks of HQ1 were a reaction of Greg, and others, trying to make HW much more like a 'traditional' RPG.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324581/#Comment_324581" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-15T09:31:09+00:00" title="May 15, 2011  9:31AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite><br/>For me, the thing is, "Why does the<i>Great Strength</i>matter<i>right now</i>?

They create a sense of depth to the fiction by reminding us that he's strong, that he's determined to see Lady Tenaka again, that he's a skilled rider from his time in the household cavalry, etc. I don't think there's even a need for the player to describe his augments for the most part, just saying the ability names is all the trigger we generally need to fill in the blanks ourselves. Unusual augments may sometimes need a quick explanation but on the whole they're just a narrative shortcut. <br/><br/>This is why I like to have lots of small augments and have therefore fiddled with the system to try to make this workable. I like your 'significant, rolled augments that actually change the game fiction' as well, but in my mind they're something separate. I have these as sub-conflicts in my game, but IIRC there was some kind of rolled augment thing is HQ1 where you could gamble for a particular modifier. <br/><br/>I think your ideas are probably closer to the game as written BTW, and certainly HQ2 has moved very far away from my interpretation. I'm not trying to argue you out of your position, I'm just trying to articulate the thinking behind mine. This has been a very interesting discussion!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324585/#Comment_324585" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-15T10:03:18+00:00" title="May 15, 2011 10:03AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2011 12:01PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey all, <br/><br/>First, yes! Good discussion!<br/><br/>Second, Neil, I didn't think you were being tetchy -- at all! I loved your post and the time you put into it. I was tryign to give you a heads up that by responding to a couple of points I wasn't trying to get into a head butting contest. <br/><br/><b>Neil:</b><br/>As for +1 or +2 not having much of an effect -- yes... a little, but not much. But that's why rolling is interesting on the <i>Hero Wars</i> table. First, you get to "call your shot" on the Augment value you're shooting for. And second, you might get double that amount if you roll well. It's one of the reasons I'm still intrigued with this. (My brain keeps flipping back and forth on which route to take!)<br/><br/><b>Mark:</b><br/>Yes, I'm working from a specific kind of "lens" through which to use the rules. I completely dig what you're saying! And can see the fun of the lens you're using. <br/><br/>But we use these lenses for specific outputs with whatever rules we're using. I want my output to be about the accretion of fictional details created at the table, with less emphasis on the logic of a physical world.<br/><br/>Of course, when one says things like this, some folks run the football all the way down the field to Infinity, believing that my output will be an incomprehensible goo of random description and illogical drama. Since that would be bad storytelling that would be a Fail and not at all what I'm talking about. (I'm not saying <i>you</i> would assume this; I'm addressing it because I've had some... <i>interesting</i> exchanges with folks online along these lines.)<br/><br/>The "lens" at my table is less about the "real world" but reality of solid storytelling. In the exact same way that the of concreteness of still life of oranges is built not from actual oranges, but from brushstrokes, hue, tonal value, curves and lines, soft and hard edges, composition and so on... We learn a bit about actual oranges from a painting of oranges, the same way we learn about humanity anatomy from a painting of a person. But what we're really playing with is paint... not oranges. The oranges matter--the act of painting matters more. <br/><br/>But that's <i>my</i> lens.<br/><br/>****<br/><br/>So, I think I'm getting a handle on this. My guess is I'll be starting with the <i>Hero Wars</i> rules as written with a few tweaks (allowing Augments at the start of all Simple and Extended contests, for example), being very specific to establish a solid, fun storytelling connection between Augments and description, and then expanding the use of Augments as the Players begin to find ways to incorporate the Augments in new specific, situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber" title="epweissengruber"><img alt="epweissengruber" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber">epweissengruber</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324600/#Comment_324600" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-15T12:06:33+00:00" title="May 15, 2011 12:06PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The initial Hero Wars rules and Hero Quest had the "whatever trait logically applies approach" to automatic augments.  That got tired quick.  I like FATE which puts currency-related limits on what traits apply when.  Dogs in the Vineyard and HQ1 taught me that "reasonable" means "how much badgering you can put up with before finally caving into social pressure from your players."<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are using your ability "Heavy Cavalry" just use it.  If you don't have your lance, scimatar, cataphract armour, etc. you are going to get major penalties.  No horse = you can't use it.  Really, stripping out all of the fiddly bits for armour, etc. made running that game a lot easier for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF you want to speed up simple contests and avoid rolled augments, allow players to pick ONE ability to give an Auto Augment.  That can work for simple contests (which resolve a whole conflict) or get super granular for an Extended Contest with multiple rolls.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn all cases, penalize repeated combos (Legendary seducer + handsome as the devil).  I motivate this by story logic: it is dull to have the hero solve every problem, and even every type of problem (seduction, bargaining, violence) in exactly the same way.  I might even tighten this up by saying NO repeated Ability + Augment combinations in a session.  If you can't be creative or add to the fiction, just invoke the Ability and be done with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have drunk the purple Kool-Aid and am complete convert to the adventure-genre logic of Heroquest 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want the crunchiness of the little Edges and Hindrances that come into the Hero Wars rules, kool.  There are a lot of posts on the forums on how to handle different pieces of equipment so that each little bid in an Extended Contest has a bit of crunch and isn't just a bid of some abstract quantity.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for +1 or +2 bonuses, a statistical analysis shown me by a professional epidemiologist proved that +3 makes a decided difference from a +2, and that the difference between +1 and +2 is negligible. Laws works by +3 steps in Heroquest 2 and with good reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooks at the rules for different types of consequences for different types of contests.  You might want to bring in the rules for Pyrrhic Victory and Climactic Contests to shape the dramatic rhythm of your game.  If I were doing a brutal CoC-type game I would use these for every contest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber" title="epweissengruber"><img alt="epweissengruber" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber">epweissengruber</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324603/#Comment_324603" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-15T12:25:06+00:00" title="May 15, 2011 12:25PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A detailed response to your detailed examination of the rules:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Problem with Getting into an Unrelated Action<br/>\n1) The rules say that to do an Augment, one must be in an Unrelated Action. To be in an Unrelated Action, one can't be in a conflict with another character for that round.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Hmmm.  The way I would houserule that is to say this: you have a choice - in a round you may take a significant action to help yourself or to help another.  Engaged/unengaged in a melee sense has nothing to do with it.  You lob your friend a potion of acid but accept the spear in your ribs.  Or let your pal get gnawed by the Walktapus while you fend of the spear.  Dramatic choice beats simulation of melee for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) The rules imply, in how they are structured and in the text, that if you are engaged with an enemy and want to perform an Unrelated Action, you're going to have to disengage with the enemy. To do this you're gong to have to make a roll to disengage.<br/>\n<br/>\n** Yeah, I'm liking my houserule for obviating this conundrum.  Thinking about this too much is gonna drag you into 4E territory.  As you yourself conclude: "That's... kind of crazy."<br/>\n<br/>\n6) The quick fix everyone found, I think, was to disengage Augments from Unrelated Actions. Thus, you made the Augment roll as part of the actual contested action -- a pre-roll to see if you got a bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\n** Sure, it might work.  But what are you getting out of it?  I would prefer if my players got themselves into some fictional position that made an augment plausible.  You're in the middle of Lunar rapine of your stead.  You hoof a spearman in the 'nads.  If you are out of the main clash, it would make sense that you dedicate an action to activating a fetch or using the "Summon courage" ritual as an additional augment to any that you have going on right now.  So before a big contest, to finalizing the framing you allow your players some kind of Augment (rolled or auto) to the ability that will be used.  So I unsheathe "Troll Biter" and the edge of the blade bursts into flame (the "Flaming ruin of foul Trolls" is going to Augment by "Longsword" Ability).  But to pile on more Augments -- say in a moment when attention is elsewhere, I consume my "Potion of Rage" and get an ongoing Augment from that -- it should be an action that rules out other actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rules of Heroquest 2 are organized along a particular kind of story logic.  HW isn't nearly as unified.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n" But I also see the same problems in both editions of HeroQuest, so I don't know. It's like someone just hasn't noticed that there's this problem that is a problem and needs to be addressed ratter than some sort of handwavey-it's-a-toolkit logic."<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are very clear differences between HQ1 and HQ2.  What do you think of Laws' attempt to tie everything, including the resistance levels characters face, to a dramatic arc and NOT to the ostensible laws governing a fictional world called "Glorantha" or any other fictional world.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about "Stretches" and other limits on players' chances of success?<br/>\n<br/>\nThey won't help you run Hero Wars.  But they are what make HQ2 HQ2 and following them would mean NEVER thinking about the dilemmas that seem to be giving your pause.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Solutions<br/>\nI'm pretty sure I can solve one or two of these problems, but not all three at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guess is I can make sure to get interesting actions and results from the Players. But how to deal with disengaging is another issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething interesting I noticed in HeroQuest 2, however, is that you get to make Augment rolls when you disengage or win the preceding contested roll. There might be something in that.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, my mind is gnawing on all this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUm...
