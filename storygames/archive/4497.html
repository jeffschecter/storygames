I'm thinking of Polaris' candle-ritual and pre-determined phraseology for conflict resolution, Beasthunters' handshake, and there was a psuedo-White Wolf game called Awakened, or something, that did a candle-type ritual, too. I remember mocking it, rather cruelly, in my bitter youth.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould people who have used rituals like this in play talk a bit about how they worked or didn't for them, and any effects they had on play?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also curious about how they went down socially in your group. Resistance? Embarrassment? Enthusiasm? I think one of the key things about ritual is that it gains acceptance through use, until, for example, &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; eating a dead bird at Christmas becomes aberrant. Obviously, most of the rituals in the games mentioned above are new, and invented for that specific purpose. Does that mean they have an additional barrier to overcome?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101839/#Comment_101839" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T05:45:13+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  5:45AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the first GMs I had would start every session with 'And we begin' in a serious tone.

I was a Typhoid Mary in Forge parlance. And gaming is *not* like a play.<br><br>These days, I prefer: in-between scenes, you get to talk about whatever you like. You should talk about what just happened and what should happen next. But scenes should have a defined open and close and everyone should pay attention to them (ritual phrases can help, but sometimes just a 'And I think that scene's done' will do). This came out of some Polaris and Contenders sessions. <br/><br/>Rituals provide high-bandwidth and efficient communication. I quite like the idea of crossing your arms to mean invisibility in a Vampire Larp, though it's not quite a ritual.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101849/#Comment_101849" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T06:04:58+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  6:04AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At Origins, playing Call of Cthulhu, our characters were 'unknowingly' initiated into a deep ones tribe.  Throughout the initiation, we players repeated the initiation phrases and oaths of loyalty as if we were the characters themselves--even holding hands around the table at one point.  I think we went through all three reactions you describe, sequentially: resistance, embarrassment, and finally enthusiasm.  Retrospectively, I think the effect in play was to establish a sort of 'group-think' that stilled any attempts at heroic resistance to what was clearly going to be a bad end for the characters.  I don't mean that as a criticism!  The rituals established that all the players were buying in to the railroad we were on and we'd take the journey to the end for the entertainment value, rather than try to derail the plot.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101850/#Comment_101850" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T06:05:04+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  6:05AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Habits?

That's a really nice mix of different intentions and styles - it sounds like the "opening the game" ritual especially is quite a bit more prevalent than I realised.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the Deep Ones thing is fascinating: an IC ritual performed OOC, and affecting both. That's way cool. I wonder if some game rituals which initially seem a bit embarrassing might be easier to come to terms with if they were in-character, and formed the opening scene, or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nMusic's another one that's probably more explicitly used than I thought. I once ran a very long game called Four Houses based on the Welsh folk tales of the Mabinogi, which we always started by playing Loreena McKennit music. Now, when the players hear a bit of Loreena they all suddenly start reminiscing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChristhor demands more tales!

The songs were really the boundary between non-game and game time.

Now, you give other people trust tokens to indicate how much your character trusts their characters.  But as players, you know that that your characters are likely to betray each other, and that the more you trust someone now, the more power they have to screw your character later.  I didn't think much of the emphasis on passing chips from hand to hand until a couple sessions in.  My husband or I was passing trust to the other, and I felt the heat of his hand and something pass between us.  There was real trust there; the embodied ritual dimension of the game let it tap into our relationship with each other in a way that wouldn't have happened otherwise.  I looked over at the GM and thought, "I see what you're doing! You're trying to make this hurt more!" with enough visceral force to be almost embarassing.  It was a damn cool emotional effect, and very appropriate for Mountain Witch. <br/><br/>On the other hand, it was something of an accident that the ritual element ambushed me as well as it did, and I don't think it worked the same way for anyone else.  I'm pretty sure that we could've gotten a more reliably powerful effect by doing the ritual with intention from the beginning, i.e. by making sure to notice the contact between hands and by actively imagining the tokens as actual trust passing between us.  I've seen basically that same way of ritualizing actions work well in pagan circles.  I don't know whether our group would've gone for that, but if I'm doing ritual to cultivate a certain frame of mind and to focus my attention in a particular way, then I generally prefer knowing what that frame of mind is supposed to be so that I can help it work, rather than hoping the ritual will eventually work automatically and in the meantime feeling awkward.  <br/><br/>Also, if you haven't seen it, take a look at Meguey Baker's article on ritual <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=16661.msg177128#msg177128" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>I keep playing around with the question of whether it's useful to see gaming in general as a kind of ritual, but that's a much broader topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102066/#Comment_102066" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T14:35:45+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  2:35PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see that bowl of tomato soup in my mind...<br/><br/>The fact that I based most of my Vampire games on my ridiculously voluminous knowledge of the Nixon White House makes it a very, very 1970s bowl in my head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102089/#Comment_102089" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T15:43:40+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  3:43PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *laugh*  What can I say?

I'll weigh in with my experiences which, dismayingly, also involve opening/closing of a play session.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was running a very successful V:tM game (d'you see a pattern?). I went all out in trying to set a mood. I bought several yards of dark red crushed velvet, and had a tablecloth made. I bought pewter candlesticks, and small marble plates to catch the wax from the candles. I bought black candles. At the beginning of each session, I would light the candles, and dim the lights (though not enough to make reading the character sheet difficult). I would describe the setting sun, the city (New York) changing over from day activity to night activity. Then I would go around to each of the players, and ask what their first actions for the night would be.. Usually involved feeding, and gathering the pack. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of each session, I would describe the rising sun and the waking city, emphasizing the hated daylight and it's danger to the kindred. Then I would blow out the candles. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs an amusing aside, it almost became part of the ritual for one of my players, Thaddeus, to cry out as I blew hot wax on him. Almost never failed. <br/>\n<br/>\nLooking back, it was incredibly effective at getting focus. It may have helped that most of the players lived close together (in the barracks) and worked together, so we had less of the socializing that distracts from other gaming groups I've been in. Regardless, I believe the opening and closing of the 'ritual space' was instrumental in the fact that when the game was on, it was on for everyone. <br/>\n<br/>\nOther "ritual" I've noticed, less explicit, over the years.. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my last group, when I ran a TRoS game, it became a habit to say "When last we left our insipid heroes...", which would frequently be followed by me asking if anyone thought they'd made it to intrepid yet. The answer was always no. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso in the last group, my Co-GM tended to "shenk" between players. Meaning, when he'd change a scene, he'd say "shenk" and point to another player, often right in the middle of a highly tense scene for someone else. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm interested in the effects of explicit ritual elements. I think, with a serious, regular gaming group, you're more likely to have positive reactions than with occasional groups, or social groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot much more to add at this point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102129/#Comment_102129" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T20:38:23+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  8:38PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2007 8:40PM by Simon_C.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Someting I looked at a lot in my anthropology thesis was the unconscious rituals that a lot of gaming groups use to re-enforce status, to signal in-game and out-of-game, to flag discomfort, and a lot of other things.  <br/><br/>Food was frequently a focus of ritual.  Bringing snacks to the GM's house shows respect to the host, but it's also kind of a status signifier, saying "thanks for running the game".  It re-enforces the social roles of the players.  Conversely, the GM might serve food to the players, signifying a different kind of relationship.  Whatever the ritual was, it was usually repeated every game.  For example, in one group I observed, the players would always come to the GM's house first, and then everyone, including the GM, would go to the store for snacks.  There was a very different relationship between the players than in another group, where the GM never bought snacks.  The way food was shared, all in the middle of the table, or each to their own, was also significant.  The type of food was usually ritually defined as well.  It's weird if everyone's eating chocolate and chips, and one person brings apples.  The type of food eaten might signal the tone of the game.  For example, junk food often signals a relaxed, fun game, while more substantial food might signal a more serious tone.<br/><br/>The way people talk often has ritual significance.  For example, GMs I've played with often distinguish by their tone if they're doing "Dramatic Intro" - solid facts about the setting or scene, or just discussing ideas.  Information for the whole party is often spoken more forcefully, while information for a single player is spoken more conversationally.  Players who make a habit of speaking in character might distinguish between "important, character stuff" which is done in character, using accents and whatever, with less important stuff, which is communicated in a normal tone.  Usually other players recognise these ritualistic uses of tone and pick up on the extra layers of meaning.  For example, people are more reluctant to challenge GM narration if it's done in the declamatory style than if it's phrased more colloquially.  <br/><br/>Out of character jokes are often used to defuse uncomfortable scenes, or to bring the spotlight away from players who are demanding too much attention.  In a lot of games I watched, out-of-character comments were used to discharge tension after important scenes.  Two players got into an in-character argument, which involved a lot of raised voices and eye contact.  Laughing afterwards and making jokes signaled the end of the conflict, but it also re-enforced the "in character/out of character" divide.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's my (slightly over-informed) take on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102133/#Comment_102133" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T21:10:56+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  9:10PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a My Life With Master game at my house for some friends.

The game was set in New Orleans.  After the BSing preamble, we began each game session by playing the song "Go to the Mardis Gras".  We even developed a little dance (more of a hand jive and some shoulder swaying).  This was followed by one player reading his Last Game Write-Up, which was a one page write-up of the events of the last session.  Then we immediately began gaming.<br/><br/>I pushed sim hard in this game (I called it "immersion").  We had In Character Christmas parties (half IC, the other half the real party... but they were definitely separated).  When players wanted to talk out of character, they originally had to put on a hat with a paper with OOC written on it taped over the front.  Over time, the hat went away, but players still put their hand to their head to signify "putting on the OOC hat".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/schlafmanko" title="schlafmanko"><img alt="schlafmanko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/schlafmanko">schlafmanko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102245/#Comment_102245" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T10:40:58+00:00" title="October 10, 2007 10:40AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2007 10:41AM by schlafmanko.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, that's neat.  I've seen the sorts of things you're talking about, but especially with regard to food practices, it wouldn't have occurred to me to call them ritual.  Who did you use for theory of ritual in your thesis?  I'm asking because I come from a religious studies background, so I tend to get my theory from Catherine Bell, J. Z. Smith, and other people who see ritual as distinguishing itself from "everyday" ways of acting or paying attention.   I don't want to turn this thread into a pedantic argument about what counts as ritual -- probably it's more interesting to construe ritual broadly here -- but I am curious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102371/#Comment_102371" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T21:11:57+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  9:11PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right that it's a pretty broad definition of ritual, and to be honest I'm an incredibly lazy academic, so I shied away from formally engaging with much established theory of ritual (because a lot of it is boring and crap).  I guess I used a definition pretty similar to Bell's, that "distinguished from everyday" thing.  However, in my thesis I was also using "ritual" in the much more colloquial sense "things we do regularly and the same way every time" or "action that has a meaning other than what is directly indicated".  I think that a lot of the rituals can be described as "distinguishing from the everyday", but focusing on that can sometimes lead to really unintuitive understandings of the rituals. Buying snacks, for example, can be seen as establishing the "play" atmosphere of the game as seperate from everyday interaction, but it's much more useful to look at what it says about the relationships between the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peteramthor" title="peteramthor"><img alt="peteramthor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://trulyrural.com/cyberavatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peteramthor">peteramthor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102377/#Comment_102377" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T22:33:53+00:00" title="October 10, 2007 10:33PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ran a COPS game with various systems on and off for years.

However, we shouldn't necessarily assume that we can produce the same effect by describing those rituals in a book. Just because our group cooks food during the first half of our game, then breaks to eat it, then continues over cheese and biscuits, doesn't mean that ritual will be useful if I describe it in a game.<br/>3. Things have a habit of becoming fads in indie RPGs: I'd argue Key Phrases and Fan Mail both went down this route. They're used unthinkingly, because they're interesting, rather than to produce a specific effect. I'm slightly worried rituals will be the next big thing.<br/><br/>For the third point, I'm probably mainly thinking about unpublished games in Game Chef. There were a few unthinking uses of ritual in Game Chef, last year (most commonly, the reading of long prewritten passages).<br/><br/>I <i>don't</i> have Beast Hunters in mind for that third point. Although I don't get on with the handshake, I don't think it was an <i>unthinking</i> use of ritual.

As such, you'll see people plugging them into designs just to see what that would do. I can totally see that happening with Game Chef or similar contest designs, and not in the least because those allow people to try out unusual and new things. I would expect, though, that if the ritual or other design pattern doesn't end up really working in that particular game, it'll eventually be thrown out during the development phase (which hasn't really started by the time GC ends).<br/><br/>A quick question, for my personal interest: do you think that the opening and closing in BH doesn't work for you because of its procedural role, or because of its process? That is, if instead of saluting the way you do now every player would just say, "I'm ready, let's start kicking each other's asses" in whichever way they like to express it, with "That was fun, let's conclude here" in whichever variation at the end, would it still bother you?

That's a useful perspective for thinking about what opening rituals do, too -- they don't just get everyone independently to focus on the game, they can effect particular relationships between players. <br/><br/>So the Mountain Witch example I gave above was a case of ritual intervening in player interactions to good effect.  Here's an example of a ritual that worked less well for that:  A couple months ago, our group tried to use Full Light, Full Steam to play a space pirate Spelljammer game, and the scrip-passing system felt really different in that context than I imagine it would've in a game about Her Majesty's space navy.  The game was basically about our ragtag bunch of characters dodging authority and staying one step ahead of the elven empire, and it had a retro / high school feel, since when was the last time I played an elf, anyway?  In this context, the part of scrip passing that involved scrawling your  name on a sheet of lined paper took on a disciplinary quality for me.  It felt like signing in for some sort of mandatory high school activity you don't want to be doing and that you're trying to get out of as quickly as possible.  Unfortunately, the scrips tended to impart those qualities to my interactions with other players much more than I would've thought.  If we hadn't put the game on hold for other reasons, it would've been a good idea to change the kind of paper we were signing in on, because constantly having to fight the ritual was impinging on my fun and ability to roleplay.  The same connotations of signing in and being monitored by the powers that be probably would've worked better in the game's original setting -- I think what happened with the setting translation was unpredictable, but not completely idiosyncratic.  I also think that this sort of effect justifies paying attention to the ritual dynamics of games, on the theory that if they're affecting the game anyway, we can make them work better by paying attention to them. (reading Graham's response makes me realize that I don't have a good reason for making that point anymore, but I'll leave it in anyway)<br/><br/>Christina                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104602/#Comment_104602" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T11:07:52+00:00" title="October 24, 2007 11:07AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I finished the Star Wars intro ritual idea and changed it a bit.<br/><br/>"Hear ye, hear ye, all persons having business before the Senate of the New Galactic Republic ad hoc Committee On The Present Danger attend and harken hereto, the Esteemed Nar-Bor Ahn, Esquire, to continue his Prepared Remarks."<br/><br/>The name of the campaign is Prepared Remarks, and it is told from the point of view of a keen investigator who has researched thoroughly what the player characters have done.<br/><br/>I intend to use the intro to foreshadow certain campaign events. For example:<br/><br/>"I appreciate the Committee's dedication to its work even in these straitened circumstances. But as we flee Coruscant in the hold of this freighter, the helpless victims of a situation beyond our control and nearly past our comprehension, it reminds me inevitably of an incident concerning the personnel who we have been discussing, who found themselves in a similar situation..."<br/><br/>Then later we find out why the Committee had to flee Coruscant, and sure enough, it's connected to what the PCs "did". <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
