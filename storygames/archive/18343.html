Would, for example, AD&amp;D's alignment mechanic count for partial credit at least?<br/><br/>Here's my attempt, by the way. I thought that maybe I wanted to limit the use of violence in say, Cyberpunk (or D&amp;D). What if an arbitrary mechanic were to be introduced such that if a character goes past a number of kills, his head explodes? It could be implemented in a stat similar to hit points or some other gauge. <br/><br/>Make that limit 1 kill, and the game could get very interesting. Without the availability of violence, they would have to rely on other resources, and you'd end up with something like a stealth game, perhaps. <br/><br/>To justify it in the fiction, maybe all characters in these variations of Cyberpunk start off as ex-cons released on probation (and the bomb in their brain is their behavior modification stimulus). In the case of D&amp;D, maybe it's justified through some divine curse against murderers. <br/><br/>I also have an example from a book called "Free Play". The chapter is called, "The Power of Limits":<img alt="image" src="http://s4.postimg.org/hn6lrh1zx/altamira.png"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
