That was my first thought as soon as I saw it.<br/><br/>There's a guy in my extended circle of gamers who is totally ga-ga for Morrow Project, and runs games of it regularly-- but only using a variant of the setting (usually magic has come back in the interim) and using GURPS instead of the original system.  I've never sat in on one of his games and suspect it wouldn't be my cuppa, but oh the stories I've heard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398091/#Comment_398091" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-19T11:55:44+00:00" title="November 19, 2012 11:55AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played this game back in the 80's in college. As I recall the first thing you did was get a map of the US and a compass and nuke us. Draw circles around all the cities the Soviets targeted. Depending on the megatons the circles were really big. The blast zone uncoated areas were the less radioactive. This exercise alone was interesting and showed why nuclear war = bad.<br/><br/>The game itself billed itself as being very realistic in a modern war way. The rich guy with psychic powers who foresaw the war and stowed away all the soldiers and weapons bought a lot of (then) modern equipment. I'm certain they need to up date that because armored cars from the late 60's are no longer "new". <br/><br/>The scenario itself was kind of cool but I suspect at this point my experience and what the game said diverge. I know our GM made up their own stuff. We were in the Upper Peninsular of Michigan (which had no nukes targeted at it - surprise!). We encountered Laplanders because they are the main group who live there now. I think the GM did not use the combat rules but instead used a set of skirmish game rules from miniatures. <br/><br/>It was interesting a fun but not really innovative. It wasn't what I'd call a story game. The rules did not help create story but didn't get in the way of it anymore than D+D did.<br/><br/> It was fun. If I was a new gamer I might buy it.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398099/#Comment_398099" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-19T12:23:38+00:00" title="November 19, 2012 12:23PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Deep nerd cred where it is due: I own one of the first 100 copies of the first edition, which wasn't even bound (!), signed.

This was interesting because "Recon" teams (that the game seemed to pitch towards for most PCs) were mainly NOT ex-military types but a bunch of "useless" liberal arts graduates with basic firearms training! Thus you'd have a team consisting of a geography major, a dentist (oh for a real doctor!), an english lit grad and an electrician with a f-ton of ordnance and an armored car in the admittedly gonzo 250 years after the bomb. (Most of the military guys went to "Mars" teams, the scientists to "Science" teams).<br/><br/>This was, for us, an interesting setup. We were the (heavily armed) good guys, out of contact with our main base, inexplicably delayed waking up, trying to convince the suspicious natives that they needed our help but our skills were near useless (for fighting or re-building) and we had all this glorious kit that the local strong-man wanted his hands on...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398113/#Comment_398113" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-19T14:27:41+00:00" title="November 19, 2012  2:27PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PS KS prices seem steep and no PDFs!

I've wanted to run it using Apocalypse World (possibly mixed with <em>Reign of Fire</em>).  If I ran it now, what would really interest me is exploring WHY the PCs thought waking up in a nuclear wasteland was a better life than what they had before volunteering. What's your motivation? Was it the mother of all bad breakups?  Also, the fun of discovering the new world, figuring out what's going on, winning the hearts and minds of the natives, and being big cheeses until your ammo runs low.<br/><br/>A full spasm nuclear war seems like a pretty unlikely future now, but if the players were willing to sign a blank check, they could wake up 150 years after some other cataclysm and have fun figuring it out. <em>7th Sigma</em> would be fun, but really mean.<br/><br/>We used Recon teams, whose expendability made for good adventure. I still have fond memories of my military veteran players setting up camp each night, complete with fire zones, emplaced claymores, rally points, and such.  Not just pulling the V-150 over and catching some Zzzz's.<br/><br/>No PDF for the Kickstarter means I'm probably not interested in v4, though. It's not the 80s anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marqos" title="marqos"><img alt="marqos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/850/nXOPCJBZCOJ7Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marqos">marqos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398475/#Comment_398475" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-22T17:03:12+00:00" title="November 22, 2012  5:03PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'll admit it. I'm old enough. I played this a couple times back when it came out. And I remember loving it at the time. In fact, it made such a mark on my RPG-psyche, I've been quixotically trying to find it ever since. (I have to admit, I located a scanned PDF -- just for nostalgia, don't ya know -- and that dampened my enthusiasm. I didn't really remember the thing looking so much like a list of military supplies...)<br/><br/>For the longest while, the Timeline website was totally dead. All the hints and rumors had come to naught. But lately, they've been pretty active on FB. Editing is proceeding apace and I understand the kickstarter is moving forward.<br/><br/>I'm curious how it's going to turn out. This game is *such* a product of Reagan-era nuke paranoia that it's hard to see the game setting working as well as it did back then. I agree with other posters -- getting out the compass and the atlas was an eye-opener for certain. But given how the RPG world, and maybe more importantly my own personal tastes, have changed, the actual system will be a big question mark. It's hard to see why I wouldn't just use some form of AW to remake Morrow if I really wanted to.<br/><br/>Also, and I don't want to take too strong a position here, the FB postings I've been following make me, well, hesitate a bit. The stuff they've been putting out there seem really "gun-ish" and while I understand that was a big part of the original, it's not where I am nowadays.<br/><br/>Fingers crossed!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398494/#Comment_398494" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-23T04:33:32+00:00" title="November 23, 2012  4:33AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check out their thoughtful approach to alienating everyone under 25 with a totally misguided PDF approach!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398536/#Comment_398536" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-23T16:36:41+00:00" title="November 23, 2012  4:36PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2012 4:37PM by zircher.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh, they're alienating some of us internet savvy 50 year olds as well.
