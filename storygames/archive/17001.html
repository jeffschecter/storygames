The experiment requires game designers of wide and varied skills. This is an explicit call-out to the community to find people who need help with their projects or need projects to help.<br/><br/>The platform is being discussed <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/16993/#Item_1" rel="nofollow">over here</a>. <br/><br/>*Villages.cc is a social space in which users trade services, but in which no real money changes hands. There is a currency, of course, but it is a currency of "hours" rather than "dollars." So, if you playtest a game for four hours, you get four units of currency. In Villages.cc, these units of currency are called <b>Acknowledgements</b>.<br/><br/>This is not a new idea, but it has a new and interesting engine. It's based on <a href="http://ripple-project.org/" rel="nofollow">Ripple</a>, where the limitations you have on spending and earning Acknowledgements depends on the degree to which you trust the person in your network. The degree of trust is, in a cool and exciting sense, quantified. Not only does your history with the person dictate the limitation, but it is also affected by how your friends relate to them. So, if everyone in your trusted network loves Jonathan Walton, then the system will weight that communal love toward a more trusting interchange with Jonathan Walton.<br/><br/>Some reasons to to consider a virtual currency for skill bartering:<br/><br/>1. When you share your skills, you're improving your skills.<br/>2. When you share your skills, you're improving your network.<br/>3. When you share your skills, you're earning currency.<br/>4. It costs nothing.<br/><br/><i>For example, I work in motion graphics so Eero Tuovinen might want me to spice up his Kickstarter video with some simple colour grading and maybe a lower third. I take his video, work on it for five hours and Eero awards me five Acknowledgements.</i><br/><br/><i>Later in the month, I have a draft text for a supplement I'm about to release. Dan Maruschak offers to proof read the text, so I award him two Acknowledgements. I have a surplus of three now, so I commission Tazio Betin for a rough character sketch. It takes him two hours, but I love the product so I give him three Acknowledgements to say thank you. Not only have we traded our skills successfully, but both myself and Tazio have something to add to our portfolio while Dan Maruschak has earned a credit and honed his editing skill set.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386491/#Comment_386491" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T15:44:29+00:00" title="August  6, 2012  3:44PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            N.B.

Even if it doesn't quite fit our needs exactly, it'll tell us how to better implement such a system in the future. <br/><br/>But we can only give it a true playtest if we have adequate participation, if there are enough folks offering services you actually want, so I would encourage folks to put a few hours of creative energy into this system and see what you get out of it. If it doesn't work for you, cool, lessons learned. If it does, consider putting in a few more.

The cornerstone innovation of this particular system is that trust is transitive, and therefore people can speak for each other. For example, if you're eligible for two hours of work from me (that is, I've endorsed you for two hours, believing that I can credit you that much without you defaulting on me) and somebody else is eligible for two hours of your work (you've endorsed them), then <i>that third guy can hire me</i> even if we don't know each other; essentially what happens is that they hire you for two hours, except you then hire me to do those hours in your stead. The outcome is that you owe me two hours, the third guy owes you two hours, and the work gets done; I won't need to trust in a stranger to pay their obligation, as it's you who's loaning my work forwards. Later on the process may go the other way, enabling you to zero your accounts to both directions, or you can sell that third guy's two hours to somebody else, or whatever; in principle you never need to work yourself to still be extremely useful to the network.<br/><br/>No idea if this is actually <i>useful</i>, but as economic theory it's exciting as hell. (I'm a game designer, of course economics is a hobby.) It'd be absolutely excellent if we could get enough people with actual needs and trust involved to field test it. The Ripple protocol must have been languishing for what, half a decade by now, simply because it's relatively difficult to get it over the momentum threshold. Most people interested in radical economics are apparently not sufficiently networked, or alternatively don't have sufficient economic activity among their friends, to manage an active Ripple network that can actually be used practically to purchase things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386499/#Comment_386499" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T17:14:43+00:00" title="August  6, 2012  5:14PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I'm pretty clueless on how this works, but count me in.

Because I'm the annoyingly thorough sort of thinker I'll start from the beginning instead of just telling you what to do with Villages; this is all interesting stuff, very applicable to game design. I'll be as short as possible, you all can read Wikipedia and whatnot for the details.<br/><br/><b>Two big ideas</b><br/><br/>The so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_monetary_system" rel="nofollow">Ripple protocol</a> is an alternative, automatic, decentralized banking system that basically attempts to bring web 2.0 ideas into the money market. The key idea of the system is that with networking tools we can utilize people's knowledge and trust in their fellows to create a presumably more efficient and reliable credit arbitration system. A bank does work in the money market by evaluating an economic actor's risk of default, so what Ripple does is, it enables individual people to do this for their friends and acquaintances, loaning money between people in a network and transferring it through social relations so that your obligations are always primarily towards your friends instead of impersonal banks. This should then, so the theory goes, provide a more humane, more efficient and more reliable banking system. At least it's more democratic, as it enables essentially everybody to act as a bank according to their own best judgement.<br/><br/>Now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_currency" rel="nofollow">time-based currency</a>, on the other hand, is a rough nimbus of alternative currency ideas that's been floating around in more or less formalized form since the '80s, and it's even seen some traction in local communities. The idea is that instead of measuring trade with fiat or commodity money, the unit of exchange is the amount of time it takes to do a given amount of work. A more radical time-based currency involves the ideal of paying everybody equally for the same length of work, while the more realistic system usually pegs the currency to the value of untrained service industry work. (It's often said that a "man-hour" in these systems might be considered roughly the equivalent of $10 in American dollars.) Time-based currency has interesting features that might be debated at length; perhaps the most important feature is that it's readily available (as opposed to the sparseness of most currencies), and all the more so in times of economic downturn; it's essentially a money that inflates itself when people have spare time.<br/><br/>These two concepts pertain to the Villages website simply in that the site combines the two ideas: it's a Ripple network accounting system that uses hours of work as the unit of account. I understand that the idea is to encourage people to help each other more freely by using a toy money, while the Ripple paradigm further enables people to get over trust issues. The ideal outcome would be that this combination enables people to sort of duplicate the nature of gift economy on a grand, modern scale. Let's see how it works:                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386507/#Comment_386507" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T19:23:04+00:00" title="August  6, 2012  7:23PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>How to use the Villages site</b><br/><br/>After registering to the Villages site you can post messages and such just like any (sparsely implemented) social networking site. The main topic of posting is offering and requesting work, so whatever you need done, you can post it at the site. You can search for other users on the basis of location, too. The two important actions you can take, however, are special to a Ripple implementation: you can give credit to the other users, and you can make promises of payment (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iou" rel="nofollow">IOUs</a>, as they're called in English). Because the Villages site attempts to be cute and touchy-feely it calls credit-granting "endorsing" and promising payment "acknowledging" (a debt, I assume).<br/><br/>When you endorse somebody you get to give them "hearts", which in economese means simply credit limit; you're saying that you believe that you can loan this person so and so many hours of your work, and they will pay you back in good faith at an opportune later time. Essentially you give a guy as many hearts as the number of hours you're willing to work for them on credit, with only their promise of payment (in real work or other agreeable substitute) on a later date. However, the Villages system has an in-built limitation mechanism for how many hearts you can give (how much credit you can give out), which is why you're only able to give out a couple of hearts to begin with. As you get hearts from others yourself this limit raises. (Seems to be 1:5, by the way - you can give out a maximum of 5 hearts for each heart you yourself receive, meaning your bank only gets to lower its capital to 20% of its total liabilities at worst.)<br/><br/>When you acknowledge somebody you're essentially paying them with a promise of future payment. Acknowledging is utilizing the credit limit you've got from the other person in the form of hearts: the other guy told you that he's willing to trust you for up to two hours (of work - the site just calls them "hours", like it's the name of the currency), so perhaps you get him to work for you for two hours, after which you acknowledge the work in the system. Obviously acknowledgements (payments) do not need to correspond 1:1 with real work done in the real world, it's up to you to make agreements with whoever you're trading with. For example, you might agree to pay 2 "hours" for some job that you think is worth that much, even if it'll only take 20 minutes for the other guy to perform it.<br/><br/>The magic of Ripple happens when you acknowledge somebody for more than the credit limit (hearts) they've given you. You can acknowledge that you owe somebody ten hours of work, for example, while the other guy has only given you two hearts. What the system does in these cases is, it tracks through your mutual network of trusted friends and arbitrates your debt through them. So two hours of your debt is marked down as debt between you two, as you'd assume, and then four hours might go through a mutual friend A who you both trust a lot, while the other four hours might go through friends B and C, or whatever. The end-result is that you owe 2 hours to your original debtor, four to A, two to B and two to C, while A, B and C each owe some hours to your original debtor. Your credit limit is essentially the sum of the credit limits of your friends.<br/><br/>If you acknowledge somebody for more hours than you have credit limit, mutual friends and all accounted, then the rest of the debt is "untrusted". This doesn't really mean much to either party, except that presumably a smart debtor will refuse a deal that leaves him uncovered like that; if he thought that you can be trusted on your debt, he would presumably up your credit limit sufficiently to cover your debt to him. (Of course the limited amount of hearts and whatnot comes in at this point - Villages is a pretty hippy implemenation of Ripple, if you hadn't noticed. A more hard-money approach would be to set no limits to how much credit I can give others, and prevent me from acknowledging debt over my credit limit.)<br/><br/>All of the above in nutshell: find your friends on the Villages site, decide for each how much credit you're comfortable giving them, and then wait for them to ask you to work for them, or ask somebody who's given you hearts to work for you. Once work happens, have the buyer acknowledge the work in the system, and let the protocol worry about tracking who's in debt to whom. You can check out your current balance in your own profile, as you would expect. And as the system says, try to keep yourself balanced: when you have extra hours perhaps try to buy something with them, and when you're on the negative, try and see if you might work for somebody else's benefit.<br/><br/><b>What we should be doing with Villages</b><br/><br/>Now this is the interesting question. My first suggestion is that you should each acknowledge me for .2 hours on account of this lengthy explanation <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Apart from that, I suggest the following steps:\n<ul><li>Find other Story Games people in the system. Endorse everybody for one or more hearts. Probably start with one heart each, as you only have five hearts to give. I think that nobody's going to default on one hour of work towards somebody else, we value our reputation in the scene too much. (This is what makes this community pretty interesting for a Ripple experiment - there are several dozen people at this site whom I'd loan considerable amounts of money without blinking an eye, due to common artistic history and universal interest in maintaining reputations.)</li><li>When other people start giving you hearts your capability at giving out hearts increases at that 1:5 relation. At this point you can start looking at your relationships with the others realistically: who do you actually trust to keep their promises to you, and to what extent? I know that it's absurd to think that anybody here would shirk ten hours of work or whatever, but in the spirit of the experiment, do distribute your hearts to the people with this concept in mind. The wise man, as you know, only gives out loans that he is willing to lose when the debtor defaults through no fault of their own.</li><li>As others give you hearts your capability for buying things also increases. You can use your credit rating by figuring out what you want and asking for it: potentially somebody else in the system can supply what you need. Presumably we're looking at "SG-like" goods such as playtesting, editing, artwork for game products, reviews or whatever, but this is not mandatory: you can buy or sell whatever you want through the system, provided you can come to an agreement on the price.</li><li>In addition to buying, consider selling. Specifically, as you give out hearts you enable others to ask you for your help: the more hearts you've given out, the more credit limit others have for buying things from you (or through you, by the magic of Ripple). Maybe ask Sebastian about what he wanted when he suggested this thing, presumably he has some use for your work force.</li></ul>\nAs has been discussed already, the biggest challenge for this sort of thing is in getting enough activity into the system - that is, do we actually need anything from each other? If we do, are these needs to frequent and complex that an accounting system like this increases our efficiency?

A history of work having been done for you? A history of work having been done for you spread across a lot of people? A history of different kinds of work having been done for you? A lot of work you need done by others going forward? If the characteristics of the needed trust-brokers are known, then folks who fit the profile can be recruited.</blockquote>\nA Ripple broker is like a traditional fractional-reserve bank: the bank has a trustworthy relationship with the community at large, so that many people are willing to loan their money to the bank. The bank thus has capital which it is able to loan out. A good bank evaluates its debtors well, not giving them more credit than they can handle.<br/><br/>In practice this means that you should get and give lots of hearts to others so that when persons A and B want to trade with each other you can guarantee their trade. For example, say that you're well-connected and have been friends with both A and B for a long time, so you've given both 100 hearts in credit. Meanwhile A and B don't know each other at all, and have given each other just two hearts (both figure that they can stand it if they lose this on an Internet scammer). A and B also both trust you as much as you trust them, so they've both given you 100 hearts.<br/><br/>What the trust-broker does is, when A and B want to trade with each other, they can trade through you: A gives you 10 hours and you give B 10 hours, and thus they don't need to trust each other on the exchange, as long as A trusts you to pay back the 10 hours and you trust B to pay it back. The Ripple system takes care of this automatically as long as everybody has set their credit limits correctly.<br/><br/>It's notable that Ripple has clear logic for reimbursing the trust broker, should they wish such reimbursement: a person can pay the broker to increase their credit limit. For example, say that there is no broker at present between persons A and B, so they cannot trade because there is no sufficient trust. Usually this would be because nobody trusts person B, the debtor, sufficiently. However, person B might pay a known trustworthy person (one that A and his friends trust sufficiently, for example) to take the risk and act as the broker. B pays 1 hour to the broker for him to raise B's credit limit to 10 hours, for example, and thus the trade can proceed.<br/><br/>It's a weird system, but logical. In this day and age we put great weight on distributed systems, so Ripple is pretty attractive in that regard, at least as a theoretical exercise. It's sort of the opposite of Bitcoin in that it's a futuristic vision of what a fractional-reserve debt money economy might look like in a world with ample information technology and sparse central controls.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386510/#Comment_386510" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T20:08:56+00:00" title="August  6, 2012  8:08PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Call me a heartless lawyer, but I'd rather have the cash.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386511/#Comment_386511" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T20:11:38+00:00" title="August  6, 2012  8:11PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero's explanation is super awesome, but part of what I like about how this system is set up is that you can basically act like you would on a social networking site ("liking" the people you know and trust) and your currency reserves and obligations should ideally manage themselves pretty well.

Maybe we're just grumpy by nature. Or too right-wing to properly hate money. Ripple has protocols for automatic currency trade, too, so technically a system like Villages could also use ordinary currencies on the side if the developers so desired. I guess that's something to worry about if the system ever becomes robust enough to be worth real-world money.<br/><br/>However, the magic of economics rides to the rescue: you could well sell the "hours" you collect to others who need the work-force they represent. As long as those others are at least somewhat connected in the system this doesn't even require hands-on pimping of the talent, as the Ripple will equate the debts and move hours owed to you into hours owed to that other guy. Just accept hours as payment at whatever rate you think you can sell them forward.<br/><br/>Alternatively, just consider the system a lark. As Jonathan says, it's not that different from "liking" or "karma" or "thumbs", except for this notion that somebody might call on you to work off some supposed debt. One could even put it in their profile: "I'm just using Villages as a scoring device for my forum activities. Don't expect me to pay any debts off on any reasonable schedule." In fact one might argue that the system already implies this, it's not like the debt-currency of Villages has any recommended clearing date or such. It's more like posh high-class Englishmen living in perpetual debt their friends are too noble to call in.<br/><br/>It cannot be denied that people have a different attitude about monopoly money. I just got an hour from a magnanimous patron, and that got me thinking that maybe I'll need to specifically think up a project for you guys to do once you've gotten sufficiently into debt towards myself. After all, no point collecting "hours" if I don't have a tune for my poor debtors to dance to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386516/#Comment_386516" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T21:13:38+00:00" title="August  6, 2012  9:13PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's more like posh high-class Englishmen living in perpetual debt their friends are too noble to call in.<br/><br/>It cannot be denied that people have a different attitude about monopoly money.

I will advertise the components of these projects as Wants on Villages.cc, offering them like micro jobs with a proposed salary and candidate requirements.<br/><br/>( ... In response to Eero's prod above ... )<br/><br/>I suggest that others do the same, or similar. To test if we have the supply, I think we need a demand. So, even if it's just an experiment (and it is), I'd like to see people recruiting for small jobs. Perhaps you want a new avatar for twitter, or you need a convention photo touched up? Perhaps you want someone to write you an essay on how to improve your web personality. There may be some fun in this, but it should be useful fun: meaningful for you and difficult for you to do on your own. Of course, you could request editing, playtesting, reviewing, layout, game design, video editing, brainstorming, collaboration, illustration, interviews, typography, historical proofing, booth staffing, demoing, and so on. The more serious we are about our requirements, the more stress we put on the system.<br/><br/>Be aware, of course, that this is an experiment and it might break or sag ...<br/><br/>*I'd like to see how I operate as a community designer when there's a quantifiable reputation mechanic involved.

Quite excellent. I've endorsed everybody for a couple of hearts on the principle that nobody wants to see me complain here about how they're shirking their obligations, and therefore there is no realistic credit risk for me trusting everybody at least a little bit. Obviously enough the endorsements could be higher (I don't actually only trust a given person here for <i>just</i> two hours), too, but I think I'll worry about that if and when some business comes up that requires higher credit limits.<br/><br/>Here's a list of SG members who've joined Villages, in case others want to endorse people from it. The Villages system is internally not very effective as a search tool, the thought is clearly that you'll find out about other people through other venues.<br/>Myself<br/>Lance D. Allen<br/>Lxndr<br/>Todd Zircher<br/>Jonathan Walton<br/>Sebastian Hickey<br/>Davide Losito<br/>Dan Maruschak<br/>Joachim Heise<br/>Thor<br/>Paul Edson<br/>Chris Sakkas<br/>Nick Wedig<br/>Dave M<br/>Chris Goodwin<br/>Jonatan Kilhamn<br/>Rafu<br/>Wilhelm<br/>Peter Borah<br/>akooser<br/>Kyle Simons<br/>Alex Davis<br/>Jacob<br/>Christopher Weeks<br/>Rickard<br/>Gary M<br/><br/>I'm obviously sitting pretty in the endorsement department after endorsing everybody, as many endorse me back. The network routing is telling me that if I wanted to e.g. pay Sebastian for something, I could route 19 hours towards him, despite only having what, two hearts from him directly. 12 hours to the other direction, too. That's enough to pay for a playtest session or something, so my credit limit is clearly not a problem here, at least assuming the banker congregation here is not over-estimating my credibility right out of the gate. (As wise bankers we understand that enabling people to overspend their means is not helping them in the long run, even if it makes you feel like a big man in the short run.)<br/><br/>Now we'll just need something to do. I suggest that if you actually think up a project and pay somebody through the Villages for it, do report about it here; the payment activity is semi-private in the system itself, and I'm curious about how people feel about using the system. I've myself already gotten a few hours as thanks from here and there, will have to figure out something to do with them. I'm right in the middle of a crunch period on an important game design project, but it's 100% in Finnish and full of Finnish-specific cultural stuff, so I don't even want you guys to look at it. Maybe I'll think of something.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386556/#Comment_386556" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-07T09:58:47+00:00" title="August  7, 2012  9:58AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2012 11:47AM by Rickard.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My username on villages.cc is Rickard<br/><br/>I'm a graphic and game designer who played and read heaps of games - Story Now as traditional.

I have two starting points.<br/><br/>The first is an iterative game design project, in which one project manager (me, perhaps) works with a team to generate a rules light, one-hour storytelling experience. "It's called Grandpa's War and tells the story of the friends who lose each other along the way." I'd write a brief, it'd get designed, playtested, tarted up and exposed within a time limit, perhaps a month. The aim would be to get something gorgeous finished to a deadline.<br/><br/>The second is a storytelling event, like a TED talk, in which one project manager (me, perhaps) works with a team to produce a handful of independent five minute lectures on storytelling games. They would be instructive or academic, be broadcast on Vimeo and YouTube and would cover topics appropriate to the passion and know-how of the lecturers.<br/><br/>If you'd like to help me thrash out a project spec, I'd pay you in Acknowledgements. If you're interested, whisper me, or say it publicly. Either way, we'll move things to another thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386579/#Comment_386579" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-07T11:46:40+00:00" title="August  7, 2012 11:46AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hah, way ahead of you Sebastian. <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17007/" rel="nofollow">Check out my test-drive!</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386592/#Comment_386592" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-07T14:18:07+00:00" title="August  7, 2012  2:18PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just posted a new draft of the game I'm designing <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2012/08/07/getting-there-in-time-rev-0-3-2/" rel="nofollow">Getting There in Time</a>.

Of course much of this is just a game for us here, but it's an interesting game; I can sort of pretend that what if Wolfe will take my hundred hours of work and never pay back, I better limit my credit exposure to his hours and let the system spread the debt over two dozen other people. By observing Wolfe's hypothetical 100 hours of debt as currency those hours become more useful for everybody: I can essentially sell those hours around to other people to buy their working hours, and thus get the work represented by the hours done right now, or done by somebody better suited to the task than Wolfe. In the long run Wolfe will still need to work off those 100 hours of debt he's incurred, but he'll get to do when it suits himself and the other participants of the economy best, instead of us two having to try to match our schedules and needs as a single pair.<br/><br/>Of course this whole concept of Wolfe making good a debt incurred to me by working for Sebastian only makes sense in a communal sort of way. That's what the "Balance" the system accounts is all about: it's sort of like how much money you have, or in this case how much work you've promised to pay to others and how much others have promised to pay to you. By treating the Balance as a real and existing thing we're separating the promised hours of work from their immediate environment as obligations between two people and turning them into a currency: it's totally OK for me to be in debt to Wolfe indefinitely long, as Wolfe can in good conscience go into debt to somebody else for an equivalent amount, and I can work to gain hours from somebody else to balance my own account. And others can look at my Balance and see that I'm already massively in debt, so perhaps they should be lowering my credit rating so I don't default on them <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>The difference between "direct" and "trusted" hour transfer is simply that you can bypass the credit limit mechanics of Ripple if you just need to be able to mark it down that you owe 10 hours to somebody, and don't want the system to distribute the debt as credit over the network. (Or can't have it do that because you don't have sufficient trust between the two of you, and don't have mutual friends either.) It is up to the participating people whether they consider an untrusted debt to be real in the sense that it's collectable. This has a point when you consider Ripple as a potentially serious monetary system, as the whole point of the system's safeguards is that credit risk cannot be incurred without your own participation. Sure, I could acknowledge a 10 000 hours debt to Wolfe right now as a "direct" debt, and then Wolfe would sort of have 10 000 hours of currency created that way, but unless Wolfe endorses that debt by giving me a 10 000 hour credit limit, he can't use that debt to cover his own debt - or can't use it to buy work from others, in other words. This is a good thing, for does Wolfe really believe that I'm good for that 10 000 hours I gave him as a lark? Any fly-by-night operator can promise you things, but how far do you trust those promises? That's what the credit limit represents. If Wolfe fell for it when I promised him 10 000 hours and then proceeded to hire everybody else to work on his megalomanic barn-raising project, he would sooner or later come to find that he's now ears deep in working debt and he can't call on me to help him work it out, as I've long since skipped town.<br/><br/>From the viewpoint of Story Games we could of course use simpler accounting systems to keep track of hours of work, but I sort of like the economic experiment aspect of this thing, it's interesting. Of course I trust each of you for more than two or three hours, but at the moment I don't need to increase your credit limits because everybody's so interconnected in the system that there are many available payment paths between us even without me trusting you any more. I can always increase the credit limits later if necessary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386775/#Comment_386775" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-09T21:11:17+00:00" title="August  9, 2012  9:11PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can't I just use the hearts to keep score?

The way the system is intended to be used (insofar as designer intent matters), though, is that you increase and reduce your own exposure to other people's credit (give them more or less hearts, that is) not on the basis of how much you adore that person, but rather on the basis of how much you're willing to risk that they won't pay you back. Giving out hearts is essentially saying that the other guy can loan that much currency (hours) from you without any further negotiations - once you've given me hearts I can just click away and incur a debt of hours towards you up to the number of hearts you gave. So technically any time you're giving me more hearts than you're willing to lose should I die in an accident, you're causing yourself a potential disappointment. I won't care - I'll be dead - but you're the one who let me go a hundred hours into debt before my passing.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough this is not a problem at all if you don't acknowledge that hours in the system have a meaning or value. Then you can, of course, do whatever you want with the hearts and things. If other people using the system for economical reasons are doing what they're doing correctly, they'll presumably zero their endorsements for you when they discover that you don't intend to honor any debts - they don't want to have any claims on you if it's obvious that you're not solvent and motivated to pay them back.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386781/#Comment_386781" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-09T21:46:53+00:00" title="August  9, 2012  9:46PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wolfe-hours are making the rounds in the system. As a one-man economic recovery initiative Lance's money-presses are burning hot in the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17015/" rel="nofollow">lifepath thread</a>. At this writing Lance is an impressive 19.5 hours in debt to various parties, or two and a half working days. Signs of inflation are already in the air, as Wolfe has asserted in public that he does not believe an hour to actually be worth an hour. Economic experts predict that the entrance of ample currency into the system should expedite spending as the value of an hour plummets. As a proud owner of two hours of Lance's future commitments I can say that I can't wait to see where this goes.<br/><br/>(Yes, that is tongue in cheek. As far as I'm concerned Lance's using the system exactly the way it's supposed to, even if it might take a while for demand to increase sufficiently for him to work off that debt.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386782/#Comment_386782" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-09T22:05:58+00:00" title="August  9, 2012 10:05PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I don't guess I expected crowd-sourcing Lifepaths to be quite so successful.

To be honest, it's got me stressed in a minor way, because my ability to work off my debt is going to be limited in the near future, and I'd really hate to be deeply in debt if this thing becomes a passing fad, and people stop using it. I'd feel like I got something for nothing, and I've got this thing about paying my debts.<br/><br/>Which is kind of crazy, really, because I probably would have gotten a similar level of response (maybe a bit less, probably a bit slower) if I'd posted the same request with no connection to villages or ripple.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386786/#Comment_386786" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-09T22:57:18+00:00" title="August  9, 2012 10:57PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, we're operating without any real risks here.

Maybe there's a bit more external motivation for the monkey brain in seeing numbers go back and forth, but that doesn't really mean anything real. No need to take this too seriously until somebody starts a currency exchange for Villages hours.<br/><br/>I do have to agree that personalizing the obligations does make it seem more real, though.

In my mind, I had envisioned more bells and whistles although I hadn't thought of the endorsement thing which gets over the time availability problem. I just figured you'd get an hour or five (I was working on the numbers) from signing up and that would automatically increase the pool of available hours.<br/><br/>I had also imagined being able to buy hours as an option, and if the person had paid and you did work for them, the worker would be able to extract money (after a small fee of course). That would make real money hours more popular than the bartered variety but if someone is willing to come to the table with cash, why not get paid?<br/><br/>Anyway most people figured something would go wrong with the economy of the site. I didn't think their objections were insurmountable but that meant that people would have to be convinced the site was reliable and could be trusted. If there's one thing I stink at, it's selling and it would mean a lot of selling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387545/#Comment_387545" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-20T11:44:53+00:00" title="August 20, 2012 11:44AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the endorsements guys, how are we working this?

This balances the relationship between the two of you.<br/>The hours you Trusted Acknowledged them are not "dispersed"! The point is, you "spent" 3 hours, they "got" 3 hours, but it's nobody's concern whom they're going to "redeem" those hours from: hours are a currency! Probably, the Trust they gave you (the hearts in their Endorsement of you) was less than 3: this is the typical case when Villages gives them hours "from" other people (that they trust and that have a credit with you), or otherwise adjusts hours around so that they fit in the Endorsement capacity \u2014 it's how it works.

That's simple enough. Your balance is the number of hours you've "earned" (by being Acknowledged), minus the hours you've "spent" (by Acknowledging people).<br/><br/>The other, conceptually separate innovation, is the distributed trust idea. "Hours" are a measure of debt. If you use "Direct Acknowledgements", then that debt is the normal kind of debt: I, the person receiving the thing, owe you, the person who did the thing. But this breaks down if you don't have any external reason to trust the person. Nathan owes me eight hours, but who knows whether he's just a cheating internet meanie-face? I might never see those eight hours.<br/><br/>Therefore, Villages has the "Trusted Acknowledgements" system. To make this work, you Endorse each other with "Hearts". "Hearts" are a measure of trust. If I am willing to stake at least three hours of my time on Nathan's trustworthiness, then I endorse him for three hearts. Now, he can send me up to three hours of debt "trusted". But this still doesn't solve our problem, because what if he wants me to do eight hours of work for me, instead of three? That's where the networking comes in.<br/><br/>In addition to endorsing Nathan with three hearts, I endorse Joe-Bob with six. Joe-Bob and I are good friends, and I trust him that much. Joe-Bob also knows Nathan better than I do, because they owned a Christmas tree farm together at one point. So Joe-Bob endorses Nathan with 10 hearts. Now, if Nathan wants me to do eight hours of work for him, the system has a solution: it'll route the debt through Joe-Bob.<br/><br/>When Nathan acknowledges me with 8 hours debt, the system does the following:<br/><br/>It makes Nathan owe me three hours, because that's how far I trust him.<br/>It makes Joe-Bob owe me five hours. Now I have all my promised hours, and in proportions I'm comfortable with.<br/>Then, to keep Joe-Bob from being screwed over, it makes Nathan owe Joe-Bob five hours.<br/><br/>The end result is that everyone has debt that everyone is happy with, rather than having to accept risky debt from internet strangers.<br/><br/>Therefore, to really participate in the experiment, you should use Trusted Acknowledgements. Direct Acknowledgements are not substantially different from just saying, "I owe ya!"<br/><br/>(I also recommend Eero's explanation from earlier in the thread, which is more complete and better written than this one. :P )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388145/#Comment_388145" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T17:32:21+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  5:32PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thus, Nathan, if your overall Balance isn't making sense to you, it's probably because you've used Direct Acknowledgments which don't figure into the total.<br/>Everybody: "Trusted" is the default way to Acknowledge hours. "Direct" is basically a workaround for when you really want to Acknowledge them X hours but they Trust you &lt;X (and won't increase their Endorsement of you).

The Villages happy-feely terminology makes things a bit difficult to understand. "Endorsement" is basically a credit limit, so flinging around endorsements doesn't do anything to your Balance per se, it just defines the parameters of who you want to owe you things. "Acknowledgement", on the other hand, is paying (or acknowledging that a debt exists - debt and payment are the same thing in the Ripple conception of money).<br/><br/>Your Balance should work exactly like money in the Ripple protocol: if you notice that you've lost or gained hours in your Balance without spending them yourself or having them given to you by somebody else, then by all means report it to the admins immediately! That's like having your bank account go screwy, the system is somehow compromised then.<br/><br/>On the other hand, your specific debt relationships to specific other people can change all the time without any notifications as your relationships are used in arbitrage: two other guys want to trade, but the debtor doesn't trust the payer sufficiently to simply add the hours to their credit limit, so the debtor's trust in you and your trust in the payer is used to facilitate the trade. The economic theory here is that you should not have to care about all these goings-on if you've endorsed realistically and according to your own moral principles: the system never grants anybody more debt than you've permitted, so the only reason for you to get bad debt is if you've yourself chosen to trust somebody too much. The system just shuffles this debt from between people as necessary to permit trade to happen.<br/><br/>(Of course in real economics we would recognize that person A and person B are differently trustworthy, so to really make it arbitrary which you want to have a debt from, you'd need to have more tools than just credit limit to fine-tune your deals. In full Ripple protocol, which Villages doesn't implement, you can set things like interest rates and collaterals, and the system in turn attempts to find the path of least cost for any debt to travel. Villages as a hippie implementation simply pretends that an hour is an hour is an hour, and if you're not quite certain about somebody's ability to fulfill their commitments, you should lower your exposure to their credit risk by reducing your endorsement until you're low enough to be comfortable with the risk. Endorsement is a friendly service after all, one you're presumably happy to make to some degree so your friends can trade in the network.)<br/><br/>As for trusted vs. untrusted hours: as Rafu explains, the "Direct" payment option is something of an exception. It's not framed as such in the system, but really it's just a way to skip the whole Ripple network protocol in acknowledging (paying) somebody: the system tracks a Direct debt between two people without caring about the credit limit set by the debtor. Insofar as you're using Villages as "real" money to track a debt you consider "real" to some extent (that is, not just playing around post-ironically with friends), then don't be surprised if somebody demands Trusted payment: managing credit risk is the entire idea of the system (just tracking balances is child's play, anybody with a pen and a notebook can do that part), and they would've set your Endorsement sufficiently high if they wanted to hold a large personal debt certificate from you. Trusted payments are better for the debtor, as they strictly honor the willingness of everybody to go hold debts from others to whatever degree they're comfortable with. Trusted payments are also capable of being used to cover other debts, so they count into your "Trusted Balance", which is basically how much currency you have in the network.<br/><br/>To illustrate the economic issues with Direct payments, and how the Ripple network doesn't guarantee them at all, consider this: I could at any time give all of you 10 000 hours of direct payment, all without you interacting with the process in any way. I could not do the same with Trusted payments, as the network limits my ability to spend to my level of aggregate trust among the network. In other words, you can only ever hold at most as much currency as the total of all of your Endorsements to everybody. As a holder of my Direct promise to pay your only recourse is to ask me to work off those 10 000 hours; you could not use them to purchase anything from a third party, as that third party rightly does not acknowledge that my debt to you is real. The Direct payment is as official as currency as any informal promise I might make would be.<br/><br/>I imagine that the Direct payment option was added to Villages to make it more friendly and less annoying and limiting: after all, it could be annoying to have to wait for somebody to give you credit limit before you could promise them hours, especially if you were IR good friends and wouldn't ever betray each other anyway, so who needs credit limits. Still, my recommendation is that you not use it ever, or if you do, only among friends. Or perhaps use it for temporary notes. I have difficulty recognizing a really valid use, as any situation where you would need to pay another person is a situation where the other guy either doesn't trust you sufficiently to take your debt, or they are capable of upping your credit limit to enable a Trusted payment.<br/><br/>I imagine Freemarket runs on Ripple protocol or something similar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388185/#Comment_388185" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-25T08:07:21+00:00" title="August 25, 2012  8:07AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            huh. guess i'll just do Trusted from now on, then, and assume it all makes sense.<br/><br/>(i think my lack of understanding, even with all of your well-written clarifications, has more to do with my personal framework for understanding what "debt" "trust" and "friendship" mean than anything else)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388220/#Comment_388220" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-25T12:56:59+00:00" title="August 25, 2012 12:56PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exactly.

Also, you can remove the limitation on your hearts from your personal settings altogether if you'd like; the limitation is not part of the protocol, so the Villages developer evidently wanted to make it possible to play without it if you want to.<br/><br/>As for how to find things to do, you use the Feed. The tools for finding things in it are pretty rudimentary, though. I suggest a trick: first endorse me, then search the feed for "posts" "anywhere" with the "trusted only" checkbox marked. This should then only show you posts from people who you trust or who are trusted by people you trust, in chronological order. Because I've tried to throw a few hearts at everybody from SG, by endorsing me you should then have a bit of second-hand trust towards everybody else from SG, and thus you should see everybody's posts with the "trusted only" search. It's still in chronological order only, as far as I know, but better than nothing.<br/><br/>If you just want a little bit of currency to start with, you should try my <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17007/" rel="nofollow">random encounters work camp</a> - it's easy and fun, and gets you started on amassing chronologistical wealth.<br/><br/>Also, what the heck, somebody should maintain a better and more up-to-date archive of currently applicable wants and needs, with direct links to the Villages posts or other places involved. Alternatively, somebody join the Villages development team (it's ultimately an ordinary open source project, so why not) and make a tagging and sorting system of some kind for the feed. Anybody starts solving this gets an hour from me, whether by developing the Villages platform or by starting a long-term SG thread with a suitable maintenance protocol, whatever. I imagine that others would pay for this, too, once it's useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388390/#Comment_388390" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-27T06:38:10+00:00" title="August 27, 2012  6:38AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't figure this out at all.

Amateurs are more incline to help than people who actually wants to publish a physical book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401608/#Comment_401608" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-23T13:34:33+00:00" title="December 23, 2012  1:34PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, the water is tepid. I'm tempted to dunk myself in sometime soon.<br/><br/>I got wonderful help through the project.<br/><br/>However, Villages seems to me a place where I will offer/seek help only if the thing I'm helping with is attractive/seems attractive. In other words, I don't feel hugely incentivised and I don't feel it incentivises others either. I think this has something to do with the feedback I receive (and don't receive). If the interface was more obvious for understanding my contribution, the contributions of others and for exploring new projects, I think I'd take part more often.<br/><br/>For me, it's missing feedback about my progress through the community (it doesn't have to be hierarchical but I'd like to feel like I'm journeying somewhere as I contribute). It's also missing an interface for negotiating and exploring new projects. It's missing a means to suggest new projects too, and to be able to explore the history of other contributors, their relationships and ongoing progress.<br/><br/>And so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411841/#Comment_411841" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-11T08:09:36+00:00" title="April 11, 2013  8:09AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wanted my homepage to be proofread, posted an ad two weeks ago, and found <a href="/forums/profile/Eero">@Eero</a> and, I guess, a non-rpg gamer.

It's a shame, because in many ways it is more compelling than other Ripple projects (e.g. the new p2p Ripple). It's a volunteer effort, though, so what can you do.<br/><br/>Any website programmer from around here wants to take a whack at fixing the main Villages complaints mentioned in this thread, there's Hours in it for you. I've got this notion that while Villages is imperfect as a financial instrument (no option to deal with "real" monetary units, and not really the security for it either), and it doesn't make much sense to develop it as such alongside the bigger and more serious Ripple efforts - despite all that, Villages seems like a promising kernel for a Ripple-integrating community site. It just needs to add all those features like project tracking and discussion options and so on, so that it has more reasons for people to follow it actively and attempt to use it than just a curiosity towards experimental economics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411862/#Comment_411862" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-11T13:06:51+00:00" title="April 11, 2013  1:06PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it was probably a mistake for this site to have "job board" style functionality at all.

Could maybe get something interesting going, if I paid for playtesting with pseudo-currency, and then that same currency could be used to purchase the resulting product later on. Maybe a Solar System setting supplement, or some old school D&amp;D stuff - something along those lines.<br/><br/>For my part this'll mostly have to wait until I have the time to do crazy stuff again <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17001/villages-cc-social-bartering-experiment-join-in/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17001/villages-cc-social-bartering-experiment-join-in">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17001/villages-cc-social-bartering-experiment-join-in/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17001/villages-cc-social-bartering-experiment-join-in/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F17001%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F17001%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
