I'm a 25 yo roleplayer who really enjoys storygames/narrativist/story now RPG's. Lately i've been having some problems with the way i play games and my own enjoyment of the experiences. And that's why i do this post. <br/><br/>So, here we go.<br/><br/>I have a hard time when i play games where hard char drama is going on. Games like Monsterhearts, or games where the characters betray each other, killing themselves. <br/><br/>My problem is that i live the Character and the story we are telling together. Im advocating for my Char. I have no problem in getting my own Character in trouble and drama if i'm in "Player mode". The problem is that i love really getting in Character, playing passionately (im identifying a lot with this blog: <a href="https://playpassionately.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://playpassionately.wordpress.com/</a>). And that takes me to a place where i start to get a huge amount of bad bleeding.<br/><br/>So, when i am in "Character Stance", "Playing passionately", if something goes terribly wrong (the kind of fiction that could happen in Monsterhearts, the bretayal of my character\xb4s best friend...), it affects me. I get bleeding, bad bleeding.<br/><br/>Im asking for tips in order to handle this, because i love to play like i play, but i can't fully enjoy a game if im being affected. And if i play in the "Player Stance", then i feel like i'm loosing the part i enjoy the most of the games.<br/><br/><br/>Do i have a serious mental problem? Could anyone help me? Pretty please?

Some I know intimately, but obviously we don't know whether yours is a similar psychological case to theirs, so please don't take my commentary as claiming anything about you - the best we can do is reflect upon similar-sounding experiences.<br/><br/>What I am immediately reminded of is one horrifying <i>My Life with Master</i> session years ago, where a particular player broke down in tears due to the game content being too stressful for them. This was directly caused by, I think, the same phenomenon you describe: the player is on board with the game's idea, but they experience the events of the game so strongly that the unpleasant experiences are too much for them. MLwM is a horror game where the GM is basically in charge of playing an abusive parent or lover to the player's character, so something like this is quite horrible when the creative development is not arrested in time.<br/><br/>In my experience being sensitive like that isn't a mental "problem" so much as a feature of how you interact with the world, and perhaps - perhaps - a lack of experience in recognizing and handling your own emotions. The player in that anecdote was and is what one might term emotionally unstable or "fragile" - easy to excite, prone to emotional judgement, easy to bully, and so on. In their particular case I feel comfortable saying that my experiences with their bad bleeds are due to a combination of being a sensitive, empathetic person, and not really having the wisdom tools and emotional maturity for handling negative emotions.<br/><br/>Finnish culture features a baseline of stoic machismo in what it expects (of both men and women, although particularly of men). This means that when (particularly male) roleplayers get emotionally uncomfortable, they may crash hard, because everybody is by default inclined against expressing their discomfort and dealing with it through social processes; instead of telling the other players when they feel uncomfortable, your average Finnish roleplayer ignores or hides their own feelings, because they've internalized the idea that expressing discomfort is childish and selfish. It is noble to suffer without complaining. This obviously means that Finns, taken as a cultural stereotype, do not know how to come down gently from emotional stresses (or physical challenges for that matter); you're either stronger than the challenge, or you break upon it, and if you do break, better make it fucking good, or others will think that you're soft. Preferable mode of expression for how bad it hurts inside is, on a certain unspoken level, to kill yourself - if it's not bad enough for that, it's not bad enough to complain about.<br/><br/>The above description is relevant as a background for you to reflect on: does your own local social culture have similar features? How easy is it for you to talk about your creative experiences and the feelings they elicit while playing? Finns don't have any more problems than anybody else with positive emotions, but nobody wants to be a killjoy, so they'll bottle up the anxiety. How is it with your culture, and you personally? Are you allowed to think of yourself in terms of being an emotional being, or are you supposed to be more of a noble machine?<br/><br/>The reason I ask is that I think that the way to handling your negative bleed is to grow more comfortable with your own feelings. This is a useful life skill in general, and my own experience growing up has been that the reason I can handle scary movies, intense roleplaying experiences, arguing with loved ones and other similar emotional stresses is that I've grown to understand myself and my emotions pretty well. In theory I'm capable of calling a stop to a game that threatens my mental equilibrium, but in practice I don't actually even need to, because the simple fact of being aware of my own emotions and being able to verbalize them does much to rob them of their power: if a game feels scary, it's generally speaking "good scary" because I can self-reflect on the emotion, and essentially, choose on a moment-to-moment basis to partake of the emotion or not.<br/><br/>More on this angle of approach later, perhaps, if it seems useful. Others will no doubt have good points on this as well. I don't think that you're alone with this experience, really; most of the actually inspired and excited roleplayers I know have similarly strong emotional experiences with gaming. We take this shit really seriously, and that sometimes means getting upset by it. That's why we fight in the Internet all the time, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465874/#Comment_465874" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-24T19:57:58+00:00" title="August 24, 2017  7:57PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It also helps a lot, when playing intense games like these, to establish a "cool down" period after the game.

Stop at 10:15 and go into a different room, away from the character sheets and dice, and sit and talk about the game in meta terms. Talk about how you're feeling.

Become the director rather than then embodiment of your character. Play your character constant with their personality, motivations and so on but for the sake of the story not them.  Perhaps, challenge yourself by playing characters that you don't relate to or emphasize with. Don't try to "win" with you character, let go. Focus on building on other's ideas and bring story threads together so that you can have a great coherent and satisfying ending. Focus on the verisimilitude of the story. Perhaps, by changing your focus you can enjoy the game but in a different way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465884/#Comment_465884" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-25T05:29:39+00:00" title="August 25, 2017  5:29AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great posts here, very thought-provoking. As another comment:<br/><br/>Sometimes feeling hurt by what's happening to your character isn't so much about the terrible nature of the fictional situation, but about a feeling of being alone and unsupported - it feels like no one's on your side.<br/><br/>If that's the case, then you might find it will greatly improve your experience of you can cultivate a culture of taking about the characters and the game (basically, as Eero and Adam say above).<br/><br/>Something as simple as the other players saying, "oh, poor Jenny! Your character really got the short end of the stick in this session. I just can't wait to see her come out of it stronger than ever! She deserves better!" can make all the difference in terms of your experience. <br/><br/>If that sounds right to you, you can start by sharing this with your fellow players and then modelling the behaviour you'd like to see (until it "catches on").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" title="Mongrel_GM"><img alt="Mongrel_GM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">Mongrel_GM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465885/#Comment_465885" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-25T06:44:13+00:00" title="August 25, 2017  6:44AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, that's super good advice.<br/><br/>And in the meantime, perhaps jump in both feet in games that might not have so much soul crushing drama.

Because, on one hand, i know they have to commit to their characters and what they believe, and i think if i get to express myself, i will ruin the mood of the game, get them out of it, and that kind of stuff. On the other hand, i feel bad, and keeping it inside only makes it worse. I have had problems with players because their Characters where killing or making hardcore things on my Character, and they are laughing, or having fun. It's hard for me to say this, but it's true, this happened. <br/><br/>I just want to play and have fun with it, since i enjoy dramatic stories (as a GM i don't have this problem. As a matter of fact, people say my games are always in search of a clash of beliefs (normally between the world and the characters), which leads to emotionally charged sessions. The point is i think i have some sort of phobia to conflict between PCs or something like that... i dont know what's the problem. Even when i am the GM, i usually do a great effort to avoid "secret" secrets (Not known by anoyne except his Character, not giving any hints, that sort of stuff), or to be sure that an interpersonal conflict is not going to be harassing to any of the players. I think that shows a Little more of me as a roleplayer and as a person. <br/><br/>I make sure, when i play, that everyone is really confortable at the table. I make use of the X-Card, i talk with them after a game, i talk in private with each one of them and make sure everything is good.<br/><br/>I don't really know where is the problem, i agree with <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> in his analysis aswell. Maybe it's the cultural enviroment, but even so, my group is not like that, or at least i think so. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> , the period of cooldown is great but my problem there is that, even if i recognise how i feel, i dont want to tell them in the middle of the game because i think that will make people loose interest on the session. I feel that if i talk with them, i can ruin their experience, and i'm being a jerk, trying to suck atention to me. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">@Jeff_Slater</a> yes, that is what i'm trying to do. Still, that approach that i have when i'm being GM, clashes when i am asked to be proactive, because, in order to advocate for my Character, i GET INTO it. That's the problem. I really have no problems if i play from the GM's stance, but i feel my chars are flat.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465887/#Comment_465887" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-25T15:15:12+00:00" title="August 25, 2017  3:15PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get it. I've been there, too.<br/><br/>I'd talk to the group about this problem between games and get a sense of whether your feelings about ruining their experience are accurate. They might affirm your concerns, or they might tell you, "no, no, we want you to pause the game for a bit to take a breath when that happens."<br/><br/>I assume that these intense feelings are part of the aim of the experience for you--that you don't want to change how the game plays, but that it might be a little too intense at times. Maybe just a 5-minute break is all it takes to clear your head and get back into things.<br/><br/>I recently read an article about how sex scenes in movies are choreographed. The article was about intimacy and safety. I think it's relevant in many ways. Where the actors' issues are different is that they're trying to create an intense experience for their audience (and not necessarily for themselves). That means that they can apply a bunch of "meta," immersion-breaking techniques to give themselves distance, and that's harder in your situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/paganini" title="paganini"><img alt="paganini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/paganini">paganini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465891/#Comment_465891" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-25T17:14:10+00:00" title="August 25, 2017  5:14PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey <a href="/forums/profile/Edgargso">@Edgargso</a>,<br/><br/>The number one question is, do you play with your friends? <br/><br/>Or another way to put it is, do you interact socially with the members of your group in any setting that is not a role-playing session? Do hang out and chill together? Go to the movies together? Watch TV, talk about books, or party together? Do you play other games (sports, board games, poker) together? <br/><br/>Basically, it's not clear from your post if you are talking about a simple empathic relationship with the fiction that you're creating (i.e., like crying when you watch Saving Private Ryan), or if the other players are using their characters to pile on to your character so that they can be dicks to you in real life. These are two very different problems with two very different solutions. <br/><br/>Maybe I'm reading too much into this:\n<blockquote>I have had problems with players because their Characters where killing or making hardcore things on my Character, and they are laughing, or having fun. It's hard for me to say this, but it's true, this happened.</blockquote>\nBut it sends up a red flag for me. The point of playing games like My Life with Master is to take on serious issues and have deep reactions and strong feelings. <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a>, if someone bursts into tears, you're hitting it out of the ballpark. I don't think it's a bad thing, it means you're playing the game right. <br/><br/>So, <a href="/forums/profile/Edgargso">@Edgargso</a> , if you're having profound emotions during play while everyone else in the group is just laughing it off and not taking it seriously, or worse, having fun *at your expense,* then you are a victim of serious disfunction and should depart that group but fast. <br/><br/>You play games like this with people you trust. Like, the same people you talk to after your parents die or you break up with your girlfriend.

I was just starting to roleplay and often got quite into character. The difference with what happened to you was that things didn't happened to my character, but to the character of a friend who got killed by another party member\xb4s carelessness. The scene was tense, it was the first time I had "witnessed" another PC getting killed. The player of the accidental killer then started to joke saying "Oh well. Hey, how much XP do I get for this?" and everybody started to laugh.<br/><br/>I got mad and still in character I wanted to make the killer realize what he had done, but then the session ended, everyone had their fun (even the guy whose character got killed) and I realized that after all, we were all good friends and characters were only figments of our imagination. So, <i>bros before figments</i>, I ended up making that choice and stopped caring so much about the characters because things are not meant to be fun for them, they are meant to be fun for us players.<br/><br/>Did the choice robbed me of that level of character immersion? I wouldn't say that, I still got to play interesting characters. Never played monsterhearts nor got my party interested on it. So there, perhaps something here is helpful, but as you see, I ended up taking a different path than you. Never regret it though. The guy who killed the paladin became one of my best friends and though I'm more or less emotionally mature today, and that I  cry more at sad movies than at sad facts of real life, I did weep a lot when he passed away,  three years ago.<br/><br/>We all still laugh at the XP joke when we remember him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Edgargso" title="Edgargso"><img alt="Edgargso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Edgargso">Edgargso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465908/#Comment_465908" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-25T22:12:40+00:00" title="August 25, 2017 10:12PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> , wow... im sorry for your loss.. <br/><br/>I think the problem is i try to live the experience from the inside, and you take the other path, like you say.

I'd say you should still talk it with your table. But I wouldn't say that the problem is that you're so emotional that they should be more careful around you. It's more like doing sports and having asthma: it's perfectly doable, you just have to pace yourself and be a bit more conscious about your current state (made some research for a game made by the company I work for, there are actual olympic athletes who have asthma and kick <a href="/forums/profile/%24%24%29">@$$)</a>.<br/><br/>So all you need to agreed on them is to have some sort of signals, one for when the emotions get too intense so they can switch focus and give you a small breathe. No need to interrupt the game nor rewind scenes nor even a group hug, just breath quickly, then deeply, try to think and focus on how intense the emotion instead of its nature, then laugh about it and go back to the game. No harm done.<br/><br/>The other signal would be for when things get serious, which should happen less, after all you've been holding yourself good enough to never ruin a single session so far or at least it seems so. When you give that signal, you can specify if it's just you who needs a break and get out of the room or if you need to talk it with somebody. Cry it out, catharsis is actually really good as therapy! Then change subject, check 9gag, get your mind out of the game, whatever.<br/><br/>The key phrase to explain it to your table is "this is pretty intense BUT I LOVE IT; I just need a moment to get myself together since I tend to get too deep in character" And that's it, I don't think nobody will think you're ruining the game if you just let them know that all you need is to focus yourself better in order to process things. Being "the sensible one" isn't too bad if you prove them that you can always get back up.  If anything, they will probably be amazed that you're able to empathize so deeply with your character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/paganini" title="paganini"><img alt="paganini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/paganini">paganini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465923/#Comment_465923" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-26T17:24:10+00:00" title="August 26, 2017  5:24PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Edgargso">@Edgargso</a> , this is going to sound judgmental, and I'm sorry about that, but here it is. <br/><br/>You didn't actually answer my question about what your relationship is like away from the game table. I'm going to guess that that means there isn't one. <br/><br/>The more I read your posts, the more convinced I am that your "good vibes at the table" are an illusion. You are more willing to bare a deep personal issue to a bunch of strangers on the internet than you are to share it with your (theoretically) close friends; friends who are supposed to be your collaborators in the experience. <br/><br/>I realize we are expert strangers <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> but even so. <br/><br/>In this discussion we've passed from "I'm having strong feelings during play," through "my feelings are hurt because the other players are ganging up on me and not taking the game as seriously as I do," to "I can't discuss this with them because it will Ruin Their Fun (TM)." That is a textbook case of serious social disfunction. It's not a gaming issue. We can't fix it for you with technical advice. There are only a few things that you can do:<br/><br/>1 - You can carry on as things are and continue to suffer.<br/><br/>2 - You can leave the group. <br/><br/>3 - You can give up the kind of "deep feelings" play you like and approach the game casually like the rest of the group does. <br/><br/>4 - You can trust the rest of the group enough to talk to them about it and see if they're open a more serious style of play. They may surprise you. Maybe there are others in the group who are, as you are, dissatisfied with the game, but, like you, don't want to be the "squeaky wheel" and Ruin The Fun (TM) for everyone else. If they don't surprise you... well, options 2 and 3 are still available. <br/> <br/>But you <i>cannot</i> get the kind of play you want with a group of people who do not share your aims. It leads only, as you have discovered, to pain. <br/><br/>Do you happen to know what other kinds of games (besides Monsterhearts) this group has had experience with? I feel like they would benefit from a really tightly-run educational series of <i>In a Wicked Age</i> sessions. <br/><br/>- N                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/paganini" title="paganini"><img alt="paganini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/paganini">paganini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465924/#Comment_465924" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-26T17:28:17+00:00" title="August 26, 2017  5:28PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.

Here's another one:<br/><br/>Make it a custom to take a break, every hour, on the hour (at 7:00, at 8:00, etc.).

Part of this kind of play is that you need to be honest about your experience with the players, before you can bring emotional honesty into your character.<br/><br/>I understand your concerns about disrupting the vibe at the table.  And it might, for a bit, as you renegotiate what the safe space and unsafe space is, at the table.  But ultimately, your game will be better for it: you'll be able to support other people better because you were honest, and they'll be able to support you better too.<br/><br/>Toughing stuff out and not saying anything won't help; you will be upset, and the other players will pick up on that something is happening.  Honest communication is the basis of this type of play.  It's why this sort of play is exhilarating, but also why it's scary.  And sometimes the scary part means just letting people know that you're struggling.<br/><br/>Regardless, I hope you find your way to a good place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Edgargso" title="Edgargso"><img alt="Edgargso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Edgargso">Edgargso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465939/#Comment_465939" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-27T11:42:26+00:00" title="August 27, 2017 11:42AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks all for your comments.

Option 2, depends on the answer i get from option 4... Option 3 is a real one, "playing more casually". But i would prefer not to go with that one. Option 4 is the one i have to go. I know. They are friends (there's even my GF in that group) but the problem is my fear about that group playing without me because i open that way with them... Or being treated in a special wa. I dont know, it's hard. But i really think all of that is only in my head, it's not real. So... I have to try. For me, it's been easier to talk to strangers (no pun intended) than to people that really emotionally matter to me. Does that make sense?<br/><br/>It happens in games where things like bullying, humiliation and that stuff gets a spot. In my past, i got bad experiences with that sort of stuff, when i was younger, and though i thought i grew past it, it might not be that way. And, although i can handle it, i realise now, after all you guys wrote, i could only really handle it if i have a safe place in order to play. If i keep playing this games with people unaware of what's happening, things go bad.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Colin">@Colin</a> , yeah, i see it now. I realise that i should have tried to cut it out, to talk with them, at the moment, and not just keep going while i'm getting hurt, and that's on me. Fortunately i still can do something about it. It's scary as fuck. But it's also a way to really be clear, honest and open to my friends. <br/><br/>Thanks a lot, guys.

Option 1 is not a real option. Option 2, depends on the answer i get from option 4... Option 3 is a real one, "playing more casually". But i would prefer not to go with that one. Option 4 is the one i have to go. I know. They are friends (there's even my GF in that group) but the problem is my fear about that group playing without me because i open that way with them... Or being treated in a special wa. I dont know, it's hard. But i really think all of that is only in my head, it's not real. So... I have to try. For me, it's been easier to talk to strangers (no pun intended) than to people that really emotionally matter to me. Does that make sense?<br/><br/>It happens in games where things like bullying, humiliation and that stuff gets a spot. In my past, i got bad experiences with that sort of stuff, when i was younger, and though i thought i grew past it, it might not be that way. And, although i can handle it, i realise now, after all you guys wrote, i could only really handle it if i have a safe place in order to play. If i keep playing this games with people unaware of what's happening, things go bad.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Edgargso">@Edgargso</a>, yeah, it does make sense. Being a human is weird and difficult for everyone. We're with you, strangers that we are. <br/><br/>I just wanted to add that you can mix and match the options some. You could play more casually with that group, while finding a second group (even playing online, like option 5 <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ) to do deeper character stuff with, for example.<br/><br/>Also, when you do talk to them, you don't have to do it like captive audience style, standing up to to deliver rhetoric to the forum. Sound them out one at a time. Like, maybe one of them seems more likely to get where you're coming from; call him or her up and talk in private first. Maybe that person is your girlfriend. Or maybe you should save her for last, depending. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Good luck!<br/><br/>- N                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin" title="Colin"><img alt="Colin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin">Colin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466098/#Comment_466098" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-05T22:29:43+00:00" title="September  5, 2017 10:29PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Edgargso">@Edgargso</a>, how did it go?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Edgargso" title="Edgargso"><img alt="Edgargso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Edgargso">Edgargso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466139/#Comment_466139" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-08T08:50:35+00:00" title="September  8, 2017  8:50AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Colin">@Colin</a> , it was hard, i talked with 2 members of the group. Obviously one of them was my GF, who completeley understood. And the other one was a good friend. But i keep being afraid of having this talk with one of the other members, since he could see it as fun-killer. At least the 2 persons i talked to, were supportive and told me they would be more aware of this.
