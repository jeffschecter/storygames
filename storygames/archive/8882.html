And you have the power to push forward this cool idea.  But you don't, because it doesn't really fit with what the other players are excited about or just doesn't feel right in the moment (even though, perhaps, that you've been planning to do it for a while).<br/><br/>We often post AP about what <i>did</i> happen, but this is a thread about the cool stuff that <i>didn't</i> happen and <i>why not</i>.<br/><br/>Here's mine:<br/><br/>We were playing Mouse Guard last week and there are two groups of weasels nested in the ruins of Ferndale, the "brigands" led by "the Earl" and the "pirates" led by "the Countess."  In fact, the Countess was originally in charge, but her scheming brother the Earl usurped her leadership and threw the Countess and her pirates into a pit leading to the abandoned Darkheather tunnels beneath Ferndale.  However, this weasel civil war never came up in play and I didn't push it because it just didn't seem important anymore.  Who cares why there are two groups of weasels?  RUN!!!  The Countess has actually remained nameless as far as the players are concerns, even though she's appeared in a number of scenes.  So to conclude... weasel civil war and the Countess, NOT HAPPENING.<br/><br/>How about you?

They succeeded, and the baddie gave up and turned himself over for judgment.

The game is with myself as GM, Nancy as Brynn the grayfur patrol guard, John Kim as Trevor the patrol guard and impromptu patrol leader, and Mark as Brand, Trevor's tenderpaw.<br/><br/>The summer session the week before had been something of a dramatic climax of the year so far, with the patrol breaking the back of a widespread weasel incursion (go Team Weasel!) by killing the tunnel lord Wracklaw the Fang in what has become known as The Battle of Greenleaf. Trevor had recruited some younger mice from the town to come join the guard, so I thought it would make a decent session of trying to keep these young townsmice out of trouble on the difficult road back to Lockhaven for the winter.<br/><br/>And then all three players turned around and made goals roughly of the form, "I will force the issue on <i>X</i> problematic intra-patrol relationship dynamic". Trevor's was, "Get Brynn to admit she failed to protect Brand" (both Brynn and Brand hit Left For Dead in the fight that killed the tunnel lord; simultaneous KO in a lethal conflict). Brynn's was "Avoid calling out Trevor in front of the recruits", and Brand's was something like "Get Trevor to apologize to Brynn".<br/><br/>So much for my plans. I still threw in a bit of "Get the recruits out trouble" because the patrol blew through my original obstacles with some stunning rolls (Four successes on a base of three dice?!? They do this surprisingly often.), but I made sure to give them plenty of time to argue. It ended up working out pretty well. This was the first session where the pressure wasn't on quite so hard; a weasel invasion tends to keep argument down to a minimum. But now that they just needed to get home, all the simmering resentments had time to come to the surface.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196685/#Comment_196685" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T13:30:07+00:00" title="March 12, 2009  1:30PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>As soon as the characters start going in direction Y, I immediately tend to redo my plans and completely block out my Foregone Conclusion X, either dismissing it or rewriting it.

There's now a mayor running things. My original plan was that after a few adventures, the PCs would find out that there's a growing segment of the population that is unhappy with the poor state of the economy and having to defend themselves against goblins and whatnot (the undead used to be the army). The old Necromancer's apprentice had been out of town when the Necromancer was deposed and this segment of the townsfolk want him to come back to town and take over from the mayor. There'd be a possibility of armed takeover, but there's also the worrisome fact that there's an election coming up...<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I could get to that stuff, my twins were born and I just don't have time to drive that far for gaming anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196871/#Comment_196871" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-13T14:40:09+00:00" title="March 13, 2009  2:40PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great topic.<br/><br/>This happened over and over again in our recent 15 session WFRP series. One of the PCs was setting himself up as the hot new thug in town, so I started fleshing out this whole criminal underworld. Then -- ooops! -- the PC dies in a knife fight. Snargle the goblin crime boss and his whole organization just faded into the background. Another PC was on the path to becoming a Chaos wizard, so we had hidden books of secret lore to track down, and the tricky business of contacting the other chaos wizards hidden in the city -- very cloak and dagger stuff. Then the PC has an epiphany and chooses to switch to Light magic. The Chaos types become antagonists and their secret schemes remain undiscovered until Very Bad Stuff starts exploding all over.<br/><br/>Overall, very little stuff was "wasted." I used Andy's "conservation of NPCs" method to continually link stuff back to existing characters and plans. But there were whole swaths of game content that never materialized, like the "Underworld Crime Game" and the "Going to the Dark Side of Chaos" story. In our post-game debriefs, we often talked about the games that might have been, and how very different everything would have turned out if those branches had developed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196911/#Comment_196911" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-13T23:12:41+00:00" title="March 13, 2009 11:12PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>In our post-game debriefs, we often talked about the games that might have been, and how very different everything would have turned out if those branches had developed.</blockquote>\nBack when my brother used to master for us, I liked talking with him afterwards about this sort of stuff.
