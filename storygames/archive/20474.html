The game is availible for free <a href="http://urverkspel.com/utpost-nedladdningar" rel="nofollow">here</a> (click on "utpost"; the other documents are character and outpost sheets in different versions), but it's in Swedish. Not sure how well Google Translate would cope with it.<br/><br/>So, basically, the game starts with mechanics for creating the outpost: defining what kind of outpost it is (prison colony, mining operation, military outpost, etc.), where it is (planet, moon, space station) and what it looks like (smells, sounds, how the food tastes, what people do when not working, formal/informal ...). Then you create the people. Basically you make up a bunch of titles (engineer, captain, xenobiologist) and give them each a relationship (is sleeping with, is dominating, thinks is incompetent) and a focus (strong ideological or religious conviction, takes own initiatives, wants to take over the outpost) from a set list.<br/><br/>So that's the outpost created. The authority is divided between the Outside (authority over threats and everything outside of the outpost) and the players (authority over the outpost and their characters). The outside gets to set more scenes. Roles are main characters (PCs), supporting characters (can be played by anyone) and redshirts (no dice, no dialogue, Outside can kill them as much as she wants).<br/><br/>So that's the setup. Will be talking about the actual mechanics in the next post. Feel free to ask questions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450025/#Comment_450025" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-15T07:51:26+00:00" title="December 15, 2015  7:51AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, mechanics: It's basically mostly conflict systems. There are four kinds of conflicts:<br/><br/>* Social conflicts<br/>* Violent conflicts<br/>* Other inter-character conflicts<br/>* Conflicts against the Outside<br/><br/>Then there's also Help rolls (to assist each other in conflicts) and Contact rolls (to reduce the Friction).<br/><br/><b>The Friction meter</b><br/>The Friction is a gauge that measures the atmosphere of the outpost. It goes up when people fight and goes down when people roll Contact rolls. It goes from 1 (harmony) to 6 (violence), with named states inbetween. It starts at 2 (conversation).<br/><br/><b>Social conflicts</b><br/>Here's how social conflicts work: The one who picks up the dice starts. you get three D6 for free, and then an extra die if your Expertise is relevant, if it concerns your Focus and if you're in your personal place (a place in the Outpost where you feel comfortable and where you as a player always have the authority to describe). You roll, and any die that's Friction OR  LESS is a hit. So the higher the Friction, the more hits. You say your lines. Then your opponent rolls.<br/><br/>Before she rolls, however, she can choose to raise the Friction, in order to get more hits. If she gets at least as many hits as her opponent, the fight continues and the first player needs to roll again, getting at least as many hits, and so on. You keep alternating until someone rolls fewer hits than the other just rolled. That player loses the conflict. Before each roll, you can choose to raise the Friction to improve your chances of staying in the game. If you raise it to 6 (violence), however, the conflict ends without a winner and the rules for Violent conflicts are used instead.<br/><br/>The winner gets an Advantage over the loser equal to the difference between the rolls. This Advantage means extra dice the next time they fight.<br/><br/><b>Violent conflicts</b><br/>When a member of the outpost uses violence on another member, the Friction meter goes straight to 6. Both parties roll and any die showing a 4+ is a hit. Most hits wins. Violent conflicts give double Advantage. As long as the Friction meter is at 6, you cannot start a Social conflict. If you want someone to do what you say, you can either scream at them without mechanical aid, or use violence. Or you can use the Contact rolls to try to reduce the Friction.<br/><br/><b>Other inter-character conflicts</b><br/>Other inter-character conflicts (a chess game, getting somewhere first, etc.) are resolved like Violent conflicts, except the Friction is not raised and there is no Advantage gained.<br/><br/><b>Conflicts against the Outside</b><br/>conflicts against the Outside are also resolved with 4+ as hits. The Outside can roll 4, 8 or 12 dice, depending on the nature of the threat. Usually, you start low and escalate. The higher levels are pretty much impossible to beat on your own, so you need help from others, which is done through Help rolls.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450026/#Comment_450026" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-15T08:36:58+00:00" title="December 15, 2015  8:36AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Help rolls</b><br/>Helps rolls are used to aid other characters in their conflicts. They are always rolled before the main roll. Many characters can help a single character in a conflict. When you help, all dice showing Friction OR ABOVE are hits. So the higher the Friction, the harder to help. This is or course critical when it comes to facing those big conflicts against the Outside. Pick up all hits and give those dice to the player you're helping, who gets to roll them as extra dice. In a social conflict, you need to help once for every roll (and as the Friction increases, you're helping less and less).<br/><br/><b>Contact rolls</b><br/>To lower the Friction, you need to ask for forgiveness, show your appreciation or in other ways open yourself up to someone. When you do this, pick up a number of dice equal to or less than the current Friction. Give them to the person you're opening up to. They now get to choose: either roll the dice straight away, where every 4+ lowers the Friction by one, or start a Social or violent conflict and get to use the dice as bonus dice, striking when you're the most vulnerable and probably gaining a massive Advantage, too.

You make a relationship map together and then everyone chooses a character from there. Each character has a relationship pointing from them (and, on average, one pointing to them), one focus and one personal place. The relationships and the foci are picked from specific lists and are designed to create conflicts. Examples of relationships are "Is in a relationship with X but is treating them badly", "Thinks X is incompetent", "Is secretly in love with X", "Is blackmailing X". Examples of foci are "Has their own secret project", "Is planning to take over the outpost", "Refuses to act without proper planning", "Is addicted to something".<br/><br/>The basic flow of the game is usually something like this: You start by introducing some small conflicts, which tend to escalate. The Outside introduces the threat with some easy conflicts. The Friction goes a bit up and down and the threat starts to escalate, problems are becoming apparent. Finally there's usually a moment where the Friction is really high and the Outside is bringing the full brunt of the threat to bear on the outpost. At this point, one of the more salient conflicts in the game will usually get the focus, and one of the involved will often say they're sorry and ask to bury the hatchet. The other part will then either accept the apology and they will probably beat the Outside, or refuse stubbornly, at which point the Outpost usually perishes (if it's a oneshot) or suffer a catastrophe which kills some people (if it's a longer series of games). This is pretty typical, but it's not set in stone by the structure of the game, and there can be a lot of variation around it, especially if you've played before.<br/><br/>And no, in the foreseeable future I don't have any plans to translate any of my games into English. I've been thinking of translating some of them into French, but I'm not sure if or when that will happen. They're all free and public domain, though, so if you can get someone who knows Swedish you could always pay them to make you a translation. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450061/#Comment_450061" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-16T06:26:20+00:00" title="December 16, 2015  6:26AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or you could convince some friends to join and I'll play it with you over Skype. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450081/#Comment_450081" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-17T07:21:07+00:00" title="December 17, 2015  7:21AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2015 7:46AM by Paul_T.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting stuff!<br/><br/>I think it would be interesting to design a Violent version of the current Social conflicts, where each "level" corresponds to the level of injury/harm.

It could look like this:<br/><br/>Each level's effects are cumulative, so they apply to all subsequent levels:<br/><br/>1 - Winner receives double advantage over the loser.<br/>2 - Loser is wounded/hurt (perhaps penalty dice equal to their loss), which lasts for a limited time.<br/>3 - Loser is disabled or painfully hurt: the wound is lasting, affecting the character until it can be treated.<br/>4 - Loser is maimed (wound dice, as above, but <i>permanent</i>) or mortally wounded (without treatment, he or she will die). Winner chooses which.<br/>5 - Loser is killed.<br/><br/>("Treatment", here, should be a difficult thing, and require the player to ask another character for a Contact roll, with the danger which comes along with that. Successes reduce the die value of the wound, so it can fail, too.)<br/><br/>It's probably better if it starts at 2, like the Social conflict, in which case you only need four categories:<br/><br/>2 - Winner receives double advantage<br/>3 - Loser is wounded, lasting until they can find treatment<br/>4 - Loser is maimed or mortally wounded<br/>5 - Loser is killed on the spot<br/><br/>I'm not sure it's right for this game (I've never played it!) but I like how you can gamble with death by increasing the Violence level, and it mirrors the Social conflict mechanic nicely.<br/><br/>I apologize if my brainstorming distracts from the conversation; it was just a thought I had, and I decided to share it.

The outpost is relatively small, and when two people fight it affect the entire outpost. The level you want to take it to in your roleplaying can vary, but in general you'll want to play people less cheerful and more snappy and on edge when the Friction is high. You'll also usually not do that many cut scenes, but rather finish the dinner scene before cutting to a different scene. This game is usually played with a pretty high number of participants (like 5-8 or even 9), mostly because it's one of the few games I've played that works well with that many, so it might take some time before you get to come back to that dinner scene.<br/><br/>But yes, when the Friction is at 6, nobody in the outpost can engage in social conflicts. They need to bring down the Friction with some tenderness first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450087/#Comment_450087" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-17T15:24:43+00:00" title="December 17, 2015  3:24PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>2 - Winner receives double advantage<br/>3 - Loser is wounded, lasting until they can find treatment<br/>4 - Loser is maimed or mortally wounded<br/>5 - Loser is killed on the spot</blockquote>\nThat's pretty interesting. I haven't thought of modifying the game that way. This was my first serious published game and it's more than a few years old by now (though it still gets a fair amount of play), but maybe I'll try that some time. I kept the violent conflicts short and the social conflicts long as a reaction to games which have long and detailed rules for combat and very simple rules for everything else. I wanted to make a game where the focus was on the social interactions and the violence was quickly over to get back to the good stuff (the drama).<br/><br/>That system could be well used in a different game, though. Especially, I think, if you're allowed to back down before you roll your dice, thus losing the conflict but avoiding injury. In the social mechanics, you can only back down after you've rolled and stayed in the conflict (but in other types of conflicts you can back down before you roll).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450093/#Comment_450093" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-17T19:27:26+00:00" title="December 17, 2015  7:27PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree; you shouldn't place that kind of mechanical emphasis on a part of the game which doesn't it. However, while I slept, I thought it might be a good fit for Conflicts against the Outside. (Allowing characters to sacrifice their own lives for the good of the Outpost.) Having to use Contact rolls to put yourself into the care of another character would also be interesting, since it's mechanically interesting and also would create pressure on the various relationships (e.g. a man who goes to see the female doctor instead of his lover, because he's afraid of her since their most recent fight).<br/><br/>How much detail in the game would need to be translated to make it playable? In particular, what does the GM do? I would play this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450099/#Comment_450099" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-18T08:18:36+00:00" title="December 18, 2015  8:18AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To make this work in conflicts against the Outside, you'd probably need to make some more changes to the mechanics. The thing is, in the larger conflicts against the Outside, there are a lot of help rolls. There might be five people narrating how they help out in the fight and giving dice to the one who will make the final roll. If you extend this conflict into multiple back-and-forths, it would mean a lot of dice rolling. I guess you can let the help rolls carry over in the entire conflict (normally they're once-per-roll), but then it'd be just one person doing the back-and-forth in the conflict, so I'm not sure that's ideal, either. But hey, it could be a workable hack.<br/><br/>Regarding translation, most of the mechanics are here in this post. I'll happily answer any questions, and if you do want to play it, I could even translate the Relationship and Focus lists for you. There's more stuff in the book, like tips, examples, a flow chart and other stuff, but that's not essential for playing.<br/><br/>As for the Outside (I avoid using the term "GM" for this game since I don't want to tranfer erroneous expectations), their main objective is to keep an eye on the Friction and make sure it's not too stationary. If people aren't fighting, the Outside sets scenes to put pressure on the conflicts and even outright start fights using secondary characters. If the Friction is not going down, the Outside could point it out, saying things like "The Friction is awfully high, you guys, and I'm gonna start attacking you with bigger guns soon". In some cases, the Outside might even want to use the secondary characters to make Contact rolls. This is a game where the secondary characters sometimes get as much focus as the PCs, or even more, since anyone can play them.<br/><br/>Besides this, the Outside makes up the threat and works mainly on timing this, making little foreshadowing tricks, cut scenes and introducing it at a good rate. The Outside is NOT responsible for the story, since a lot of this is driven by PC-PC conflicts, but they're responsible for the threat. The Outside gets to set scenes in between the players' turns, so they can be aggressive and set every other scene, or lean back and let the players carry the action. This also means that it's easier for the Outside to "waste" scenes on little things like cut scenes and exposition.<br/><br/>So yeah, if you do want to play this, I can translate the necessary lists, but as I said, I don't think I'll publish an English version.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450100/#Comment_450100" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-18T13:43:28+00:00" title="December 18, 2015  1:43PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's really helpful, thanks!<br/><br/>Of course, it would be great to have the lists, but I don't know how much work is involved for you to do in translating them.

It's a list of questions for the Outside to ask the others to flesh out the outpost. It's not exhaustive, so you can make up your own questions. I usually ask them about two questions each (don't ask the group, ask one person at a time.

I recommend asking about the number of people on the Outpost as one of these questions. Don't make it too big. I'd say maximum 50 people, minimum 6.<br/>5: Start the relationship map by naming a bunch of Expertises (for example Engineer, Administrator, Chief Geologist, etc.). Aim for 6-8 of them, depending on time constraints and number of players. Try to have one or two more than the number of players (not including the Outside), if possible, but not more than 8 total.<br/>6: Take turns sending round the lists of Relationships and Foci. When it's your turn, assign one Relationship or one Focus to one role (in the case of Relationships, a Relationship going FROM the role takes up its "slot"). The Outside also partakes in this.<br/>7: When everyone has a Focus and a Relationship, assign name and gender. If you want, you can randomly assign genders. For names, I usually do first and last names from different cultures, and then replace a few letters to make it look more futuristic, for example Taqiana Cheng or Zven Beiker.<br/>8: Players pick their characters and transfer them to character sheets. They note the name, Expertise and Focus and they make up their Personal Place on the outpost. The Outside and the players who are done first transfer the remaining characters to their own sheets.<br/>9: You're done! Time to start playing. The players take turns setting scenes and the Outside can cut in and set scenes between any two players.<br/><br/>Also important:<br/>1: Players have authority over their characters. You can't kill a character without player consent and you can't place them in a scene without their consent. You can, however, kill redshirts (non-character people on the outpost) as much as you want. You don't even have to roll dice for it unless a character tries to stop you.<br/>2: The scene framer has authority over who's in the scene and who's not. You can't show up in a scene without the scene framer's consent. They also choose to cut the scene.<br/>3: The players collectively have authority over the outpost and what's in there. The Outside can't make stuff up in the outpost without consent from the players.<br/>4: The Outside has authority over the threat and everything outside of the outpost. Players can't make stuff up there without consent.<br/>5: Each player has authority over their character's Personal Place. Anytime a scene is set there, it's that player, and not the scene framer, who describes what it looks like. You can use this to let the place mirror the emotional state of the character. Make it tidy and organized, chaotic and dark, etc., depending on the character's mood.<br/><br/>Note that you don't necessarily have to ask for permission to make stuff up in areas where someone else has authority. If you think you risk doing something the one with authority might not agree to, do ask, but you can also just go ahead and trust that people will object if you're stepping on toes. This depends on each group's dynamics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450353/#Comment_450353" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-05T22:54:50+00:00" title="January  5, 2016 10:54PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And as your friendly neighbourhood Simon Petterson translator, here are the lists in English:<br/><br/>What are the sections of the outpost?<br/>What does it look like inside?
