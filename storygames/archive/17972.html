Boco and I did a two player mini game to see if it would work at all and found that it worked wonderfully. <br/><br/>To recap: Fairy Tale Assassin League is a modern day revenge/crime game with fairy tale characters in Las Vegas who are out to get the bad guy. Please see the Action Card threads to see the art. Location cards are placed on a table to form the game board. Players lay character cards next to locations and may move around each turn. There is a stack of scene cards that guide the players through a revenge story that have to be played to end the game. Players also have a hand of five action cards that they can play instead of using a scene card to add to the story. Players may suggest additions to other players stories that that player can accept or reject but players can also play an action change and challenge a player to force an addition (which risks accidentally helping the first player win the game if the challenge fails). The scene and action cards give players victory points and suggest ideas on what to do in a scene.<br/><br/>Here is how the game went:<br/><br/>The set up was very fast. Laying cards out doesn't take much thought or effort. This is successful as a "no prep" game.<br/><br/>The host of the game (me) runs the bad guy. I picked the Evil Queen and put her in the Penthouse. Boco picked Hanzel and Gretel and put them in the kitchen of the restaurant. Next the bad guy makes up a brag of how bad they are. I bragged about how the Evil Queen controlled all the vice in the city - the really dirty stuff. The heroes then make up how the bad guy done them wrong. Boco said Hanzel and Gretel were working in the kitchen as slave labor to pay off a debt. This was why my character needed to die.<br/><br/>The host starts the game. Instead of playing an action card I pointed to the top scene card "What is the bad guy doing now?" and said that the Queen had a load of fresh meat coming in for the brothels. Boco suggested that they were coming from Scandinavia which I accepted. I pulled out three unused character cards to be the victims being trafficked: Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood, and a Santa Claus style elf names Alfie. Boco did not challenge this so I moved myself and the victims to the desert highway next to a hole in the ground. <br/><br/>The game is played in turns to Boco was up next. He played an action card "Over hear" and told about how H and G over heard about the shipment coming in but also about how how the restaurant was full of illegal drugs that could be tied to me. I challenged this by playing a "Bad luck" action card and setting the Big Bad Wolf (in zoot suit) next to them saying how they were caught in the act of snooping. We both rolled 2d6 and I lost. This gave Boco my action card to add to his victory point total. I tried to move the Wolf to the desert but Boco objected so we rolled off again and I lost... again. Instead he moved to the Penthouse.<br/><br/>I played an action card "Capture" on my turn and had the queen tell the victims that they could either work for me or be buried in the hole in the desert and that they chose to work for me. No challenge happened and I picked up the card.<br/><br/>We decided to wrap it up at this point because the point was not to play a full game but to see if the rules were just immediately broken. In terms of victory points we were tied. <br/><br/>Observations:<br/><br/>The game played fast and smoothly. The rules regulated how we interacted but did not get in the way or feel clunky. The cards titles did help us make up stuff by limiting our choices down to a manageable level. The art work well to encourage gonzo actions which is what I wanted. My brain was not too taxed by playing. In a word - Fun.<br/><br/>I noticed that the print on the location cards was a little hard to read so I need to go back in and airbrush out a text block. The scene card art didn't add much so I think I will go back in and make them solid color cards. Some of the Action Card lettering needs a little tweaking but the action cards and character cards looked good on the table. <br/><br/>All in all I was very pleased. A few more tweaks and this project is done - which is good because my interest is shifting to the next game I need to do - Hungry Dragon.<br/><br/>Chris Engle<br/><br/>PS: I didn't think the game would work as a two player game at first but it did. This means it can be played by two to eight players. I think it will remain a quick play game - possibly two hour sessions (a length I like because it allows players to get in multiple games in a day. My crew like to do several different board games in a day together.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
