One of the things that bugs me about GURPS Basic is that it HAS a default setting.  The basic HERO book, conversely, does NOT (unless something changed between FRED and when it was revised) and I like that a lot better. <b>Fastlane</b> was designed with FRED in mind more than GURPS.<br/><br/>Without resorting to default settings, which I think is actively bad for the game for the same reasons as any artwork representational of the SIS would be, can you think of any other ways that I can convey more about <b>Fastlane</b>? To Judson specifically, what could I do to the game to help you, without resorting to these things that I feel are actively bad for my product?<br/><br/>And more generally - without settings or SIS-representational art - what methods can you imagine to get across a game like <b>Fastlane</b> such that individuals such as Judson could grab it and sink in their teeth?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83849/#Comment_83849" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-28T22:34:57+00:00" title="July 28, 2007 10:34PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you think a single setting would be poison, then build up an immunity to setting -- by shotgunning a bunch of them.

It's not about something in a setting sense though, just like Paladin and PTA aren't either, it's about something in the sense that it encourages you to tell a particular kind of story. The rules, and the wheel, as long as you aren't playing GMless, pretty much dictate that players will slowly run out of chips, with brief bumps of good fortune when they hit their number, but overall, the characters will be in a death spiral. That's what Fastlane seems to be about to me, it's about people on their way down, about how the house always wins.

I think Fastlane would shine with a lot of vignette/microfiction stuff tied to its themes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>Give your game stories.</blockquote>\nMy first, kneejerk reaction was that this might make the game look silly in the same way that GURPS looks silly by trying to pack the book (and at least 3rd edition, even the cover; I decided I was done with GURPS when they decided 4th edition would be all-hardcover, all-color-interior, I don't like paying for useless bloat) with artwork from all sorts of settings. <br/><br/>My second was that, well, <b>Fastlane</b> already has quite a list of settings in it, there's a few pages with paragraph-long descriptions of eight settings ranging from fantasy to far-future, almost half of which came from Actual Play. But I realized that's different from having vignettes, from having narratives.  For some reason I'm now picturing something like the flores in Nobilis. <br/><br/>The only story in <b>Fastlane</b> right now is the extended example of play, which is honestly a story of the <i>players</i> as they learn the rules step by step and create and then play in their own creation.  And even if I do put in other stories, which I might, this is the most important story to me, because it's about on some basic level what <i>roleplaying</i> to me is about - getting together with your friends and then creating stuff.  The EoP has a consistent setting so that the readers can reference these characters as they learn the rules along with the people in the example.<br/><br/>Maybe adding these vignettes will help me reach my vaunted goal - a game that an rpg.net review would rate a "5" on style while having no interior art.  I swear every single review so far that I've seen all "man, this game is stylish, but it has no art so I'm marking that part down."  Sad Lxndr. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite>From my reading (not playing, haven't played it yet) of Fastlane, it certainly seems to be about something.</blockquote>\nIt's meant to be!  And I think most of your rambling after that point is pretty solid, although even GMless, unless luck is on your side you'll slowly run out of what's most important - your Life.  Chips might be a bit more free, but that doesn't make your character any more safe, especially since everyone else also has extra chips.  "Death Spiral" is a bit harsher than I usually think of it but you've got the right ideas.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite>That's what Fastlane seems to be about to me, it's about people on their way down, about how the house always wins. It's a game about something, not a setting, but a particular kind of story.</blockquote>\nI'd put an 'almost' before 'always' but otherwise it looks like you have the ideas behind it down pat.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> So the question - and maybe only Judson can answer this, but if anyone has found themselves thinking similar things to Judson I'd like to hear your words too - is how can I better get across what <b>Fastlane</b> is about to you?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: 1000buffalo</cite>Fastlane, while officially not having a default setting, seemed to me to have a default of modern life [...] Probably from the regular, consistent examples and use of the wheel.</blockquote>\nYeah, this is actually a trend I'm trying to fight <i>against</i> - the trend to look at the wheel especially and conclude some sort of modern game, preferably with casinos and the like. <b>Fastlane</b> shines everywhere, its rules are good no matter what kind of setting/genre you use. Whenever I sit down to run a fresh game (i.e. one with no pre-generated stuff) I'll admit I tend to nudge and make ideas to break out of that mold before the group makes a final decision (though if they decide to go plain modern I can enjoy it). <br/><br/>My example of play (taken from actual play for maximum authenticity, and consistent for educational reasons) doesn't exactly help, nor does the fact that the only pre-gen "convention game" I have on my page is some James Bond thing actually set in a casino. I haven't had much need to make more convention games since I've found that you can do a pretty good 4-hour or 6-hour story from start to finish, including what the book calls Premeditation. Since that's part of where <b>Fastlane</b> shines I like to show it off where I can.<br/><br/>Thanks everyone so far for your input!

You have to somehow give them just enough information for them to be able to decide what it's about for themselves. It's a tricky proposition to say the least, and it can be somewhat uncomfortable for an artist when an audience decides that the work means something other than they intended (which is almost all the time <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/>).<br/><br/>But that's the trouble with art: an audience has to make it theirs to appreciate it. But I digress.<br/><br/>One practical technique I've found is to list a bunch of random conceptual fragments that you find have a strong thematic resonance with the work, and then try to figure out the kind of resonance those elements have with everyone else. For example, when I hear <i>'fastlane'</i>, I think of <i>'cars'</i>, and <i>'risk'</i>, and <i>'taking control in one's life'</i>. I have no idea what the title means to anyone else however. I'm not very good at this.<br/><br/>But neither are most companies, which is why they tend to stick to using concepts with well established resonances.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Sorry, my art and marketing studies got a little smushed together here and created a kind of proto-peanutbuttercup of pure thought you see before you.

(This is before The Sims Online and is about a very different kind of community - crafters of digital objects, essentially.) They talked about how they fed the community by leaving "low-hanging fruit" in the technical infrastructure of the game - things they left almost-complete, that the community could then dig into and find, and say, "those idiots, they could have completed this and they didn't!" and complete it themselves. But the psychological dynamics of that are neither here nor there, I'm talking about something else.<br/><br/>You know how people are always putting Jedi into Dogs in the Vineyard, and crazy things into The Mountain Witch and so on? <br/><br/>I think the other settings are low-hanging fruit. I think you get them when you put a story into your game that expresses your thematic engine really clearly and really strongly. That engine is the idea you want to transmit, and if you transmit it successfully, the multi-genre play will happen on its own.<br/><br/>When you play Fastlane, what's your favorite setting to put it in?

I'm pretty sure I'm not the only person out there with games like that, and if one less person winds compromises by putting a setting in their game because of the work this thread (ideally) will accomplish, or be the start of accomplishing, the happier I will be. <br/><br/>I know what <b>Fastlane</b> is about. Unfortunately, I don't have <i>words</i> to easily describe what the game is about (I'm often an abstract/intuitive thinker, at least with ideas, rather than a verbal one), and certainly I don't have the marketing/buzzspeak spark to make those words, if I had them in the first place, interesting to my potential audience (I often get all wordy and verbose). Also, I honestly believe that having a setting, even if it transmits what the game is about to the audience, is detrimental to the game simply by being there, and I don't want to do anything to hurt the game before it gets to the audience.  This is only about <b>Fastlane</b> as a specific case anyway, of the more general category, and hopefully the help I get from this thread will help future people in similar situations to myself.<br/><br/>Perhaps the microfiction idea communicated by Iago earlier is the way to go (not QUITE story without setting, but pretty close). But maybe there's more, maybe there's something even better - which I can do either in combination with, or instead of, that idea.  I'm still interested in hearing more ideas, be they about <b>Fastlane</b> in particular, or more generally about the category of games that it's in, which I have a feeling is larger than '1 or 2 member's - where a setting would be detrimental, so some alternative method is necessary to attempt to grab the potential audience (this might even include some already-published games with settings). Heck, I think <b>Fastlane</b> might have some of the simpler/easier ideals to communicate, compared to what could be in this particular category.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite>What's your anchor point?

I can play DitV on Mage: The Ascension. The Dogs enforcers appointed by the council of the Nine, the settlements are chantries and so on. The game is mapped to another setting.<br/><br/><br/>But you mentioned PtA. PtA does not provide a setting but similiar structural elements one a different level. There's Franchise and Issue and stuff like that. Instead of mapping the standard settings to your own, you just fill the variables.  <br/><br/>Furthermore those setting-like variables in PtA have a source well known to the readers: "You play a game and do it like a TV series."<br/><br/>If you want to do it like PtA, find a motto and derive what kind of variables you need.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84030/#Comment_84030" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T08:54:47+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  8:54AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes!

Which I realize is only sort of helpful, in that other people posting about their games, and doing so in an engaging fashion, is not something that you the game designer has a lot of control over.  You can post some APs of your own, especially when in playtest, but at some point people start rolling their eyes and skipping over <em>yet another</em> thread by that guy talking about his game.<br/><br/>Lx, do you have a blog?  I'm not certain (and I probably have you on RSS if you do).  Regular blogging, and regular blogging of AP, does work, but it's got to be regular and continuous over a long patch of time -- a couple months -- and it's hard to keep up.<br/><br/>Now, you can take a little control of AP posts by soliciting them, and if you blog, you can have 'guest posts' by folks who you invite to write up AP of Fastlane.

I thought they made it pretty clear that the game was a generic game that could be applied to any high-action situation.  <br/><br/>So...yeah. I think you got where you were meaning to go. Not everyone has to like it. Me, I like generic systems.<br/><br/>I think the 'actual play' suggestion for how to get the "story" tone across misses the mark a little, remember, Alex got hit by a car and died the second after I got my Fastlane book from him. It was very sad. An Indian shed a single tear. <br/><br/>I got a clear picture of the kind of stories I would be making using Fastlane from reading the book. However, there are ways to make it clearer: play examples, play explanations, flowcharts telling me what to do when, and so on.  "Thematic premise"?? I don't even know what the hell that is, or I can pretend I don't because nobody's ever clearly told me what it is.<br/><br/>The use of the wheel we've already discussed ("for gods sake, your game has as its target audience people with a roulette wheel in the garage that they're not using to play roulette"), but I can see how it could influence people towards modern settings actually involving gambling or even roulette itself.

That said, I think what you're fighting against are the connotations of the basic elements of your game- the name, the roulette wheel mechanic, and (if what I've read above is true) the casino-based play examples in the text.  Even the marketing text on your website.  These represent the loudest, most obvious aspects of your game, and they all suggest a modern crime/casino action story.<br/><br/>I realize that you've worked out mechanics for using dice instead of an actual wheel, but as your games central mechanical gimmick, it's hard for some folks to get around.   Unlike common dice- which most everyone generally associates with "games", rather than specifically with gambling-  the roulette wheel is unusual, and has clear associations with casinos.   I've actually made this same argument about using playing cards as a game mechanic- I think it creates an initial clash of expectations for players, unless they play the game enough to get used to it.  Games that take advantage of these associations (<i>Dust Devils</i>, <i>Bang!</i>, etc.) do better at overcoming this.<br/><br/>So I guess what I'm saying is that I think the basic, powerful elements of your game represent (an apparently unintended) expression of setting- it's a game about high-stakes action, betting everything you have to get what you want, etc.   I say embrace that, and make the game about that, instead of fighting it.  Then move on and make <i>another game</i> with much of the same underlying structure that is finely tuned to another genre or setting that you're interested in, and encourage others to do the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84091/#Comment_84091" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T11:22:05+00:00" title="July 30, 2007 11:22AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do plan on a new cover for <b>Fastlane</b>, at an absolute minimum.  However, art that communicates a setting (i.e. here's a car, here's policemen, here's a dashboard = modern!) is, to me, as bad as having a default setting. I've been struggling for almost a year now trying to find a better cover, one that manages to communicate feel and situation, as you said, without communicating setting, like the one you've described does.  This is <i>hard</i> and any ideas you have on how to do this would be much appreciated.<br/><br/>A while back Paul Czege gave me a description that sounded pretty good but I couldn't get an artist to do anything with it that worked - and as one of the least visual thinkers in the world (I react well to them, but communicate poorly in any visual manner, it gets translated somehow in my head), I pretty much was a liaison between Paul and the one artist that came halfway close enough that I wanted to work with him (occasionally I'd be asking other people who are actually art-oriented for their input as well). \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Lx, do you have a blog?</blockquote>\nConsidering the detrimental effects I feel blogs have on the post-Forge design community (as I've said before - "It's a pity that instead of creating a community when we left the Forge we created a bunch of blogs instead" - something that time and experience hasn't made me feel any better about), I'd feel pretty hypocritical creating one (and adding to the problem) simply to attempt to promote my game. (Talk about my views of blogs vs. communities probably deserves its own thread.)<br/><br/>I technically have a blog (LJ), but aside from one April Fool's post and some hyperfrenetic attempts to get the word out about my whole brain tumor thing while I was somewhere without my address book, I don't think there's anything there, certainly nothing of substance.  I just use it to occasionally check up on anyone else who happens to be on LJ, and then only when I'm bored. I can't be arsed to set up an RSS reader that usually can't pick up on the comments (half the really good stuff in my opinion) and has no functionality to let me post my own comments (thus effectively locking me out of the discussion).<br/><br/>That said, back when I was playing <b>Fastlane</b> quite regularly, I made AP posts on the Forge and other communities, and even now whenever I get to it (school + change of social group = not a lot of play time for anything right now) I make an AP post after the fact, usually on the Forge, though I think the one from last TusCon might have been posted here?  Also, Actual Play reports only helps people already plugged into the network.  It won't help people looking at a book for the very first time.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite>What's your anchor point?

And yes the skiing setting in the EoP is modern, but it's more Melrose Place than anything - it's a ski movie, with people measuring their metaphorical penises on the slopes instead of at the tables.

Spirit of the Century has a gorilla in a biplane with an exploding zeppelin on the cover.  It communicates what the game is about, and touches on a setting that fills *maybe* 5% of the book.

What I feel would be a compromise on my vision and creation, you feel as "balls" and a positive way to go. Believe me, right now I'm tempted to go with something like what I consider Sorcerer's <i>real</i> cover, that purple felt thing with the word "Sorcerer" embossed in gold that is hidden underneath the dust jacket. I cannot get over how much better and more evocative the book looks without that flappy piece of paper on it. (I saved the flappy piece of paper for the art, but it'll never go on the book again). Or Burning Wheel's presentation - a nice solid cover with just the title on it.  That's really the kind of book that catches <i>my</i> attention.<br/><br/>I wonder if I shouldn't just go with something like this: just the word '<b>Fastlane</b>' on it in black, over a cover painted probably in some sort of a psychedelic, abstract splash of colors like someone dropped a hallucinogen and got into some art supplies.  No back cover text at all.  But I have a feeling, as much as it would be better to the game as an <i>object</i> it would be detrimental to the game as a <i>project</i> and something more . . . well, like this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>Then on the back cover show three (or more) panels, each of which gives that face a different context.  It'd be an interesting exercise in partial image recycling for the artist... and could really sell the concept of the multi-genre-supporting game.</blockquote>\nAlthough it feels like a total cop-out to just illustrate multiple genres (like the GURPS 3rd edition cover with the silly people-in-bubbles thing) in an attempt to illustrate that the game is not about genre, but is instead about style and attitude <i>regardless</i> of genre, this is certainly one of the best methods so far to go down this particular path that I've witnessed.  That said, if I did this at all, I'd probably have the extraction panels be interior - the black and white interior images will be more obviously subjugated to the primary image on the front.<br/><br/>And since <b>Fastlane</b> is about conflict, instead of one face, I'd probably have two faces, in side view, looking at one another, as if they were struggling over/about something.  Probably their genders are only hinted at, so when we scale backwards, sometimes the girl's on one side, sometimes on the other, sometimes it's two men, sometimes it's two women... I don't know. That still kind of feels like copping out.  I'm looking over the games on my shelf, looking at what I like best, what I want to see the most, and perhaps this is only marginally on topic, but given what we're talking about, I should share it since I've realized it:<br/><br/>Roleplaying book exteriors I think are at the top of their craft: Shock:, Nobilis, Burning Wheel, Principia Malefex, Sorcerer (beneath the dust jacket, so maybe it doesn't count), PTA's second edition, Hero 5th edition (main book) and probably a few others. These are the objects I want to emulate, this is the direction I want to improve and more generally want to see more games go. Shock:, Nobilis and BW have about the right amount of interior art, I feel, too. I'm becoming increasingly wary of games with art or production bloat - color interiors, art on every page, even being hardcover - but now I'm wandering way off topic.<br/><br/>Either way, I'm pretty sure <i>this</i> is the kind of object I want all the books I design to emulate, and hopefully to lead/inspire others into emulating. And this is <i>on top</i> of all the other reasons I've stated before for why I don't want SIS-representational art in or on <b>Fastlane</b> in particular.<br/><br/>To bring this back to the beginning, I think this path might be more difficult, but is the one with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">balls</span> in my world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84389/#Comment_84389" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T15:29:18+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  3:29PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stark black and white cover slashed diagonally: upperleft is white, lowerright is black.

And I like your description.  Do you think it would work well with red/black?  Removing the wheel is good, but I do like the red/black colors Roulette uses and would like to pay homage to that on any kind of abstract cover.  I'd also love to include a bit of green, but I have a feeling that would be overkill - half-red, half-black, words in green?  Sounds like it'd be icky.<br/><br/>Before I go thinking any further down this road - would this help people at least pick up and look at my poor game, undeserving of its current state of neglect by consumers and players?  Paul's ideas are awesome and striking.<br/><br/>ETA:  Conversely, Paul's idea do not "communicate what <b>Fastlane</b> is about" but perhaps that's not the job of the cover.  I'm still turning over the idea of microfiction and the like in the book, which I did love in Nobilis and which I think might well work here too.

"Fastlane" is an awesome title for a game, though, but it definitely screams modern-day setting to me. It's probably way too late to change the title without giving up a certain amount of name recognition. So embrace the modern setting with a nod to using the game for other settings. Give specific examples for handling some modern adrenaline thriller scenarios: the bank heist, the car chase, the Mexican stand-off, the undercover detective bluff, and so on.<br/><br/>"Everything, all the time" is not what the game is about. It's a tag line for what the game is about (and borrowed from the Eagles even). The game is about pushing things to the breaking point because you're out of control and addicted to speed. It's about needing that next fix of whatever -- drugs, love, excitement, endorphins, violence, money -- and what you're willing to do to get it. Right?<br/><br/>Want reviewers to read the text and go, wow, cool, style? Examples that showcase the players aren't it. They might be the clearest way to show how the game is played, but they're not the most exciting. Ever watch someone else play an RPG? Not always a lot of fun. Write it from the characters' points of view and subtly work in the mechanics, either off to the side or something else. Make the rules in the example the sidebar to the excitement. Your game is about the excitement.<br/><br/>Now I need to go take my own medicine. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84644/#Comment_84644" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T09:55:23+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  9:55AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If your goal is to get books into peoples' hands, then yes, graphic design is a piece of that.

"A" does not guarantee good sales, and "B" does not preclude good sales, but there is a certain bias in sales behavior inherent in both.  I think your answer is "B".  At that point, you need to decide whether the baggage that comes along for the "B" ride -- potentially reducing saleability but creating something that feels artistically true to you (and possibly you alone) -- is something you're willing to carry.<br/><br/>Which touches on a sidebar -- I feel at times like the "everyone can publish" movement stopped short once folks got to the publication step.  "Okay, I'm published!"  It ain't an end-step.<br/><br/>I think there are a number of ways to approach the thing, and I don't place a value judgment on any of it.  But I do think it's important to figure out which one you want to be, and set your standards of happiness on what goes along for the ride:<br/><br/>- I write my own game!  But it's for me, no publication necessary.<br/><br/>- I publish my game! But it's as a work of art, not a product oriented on sales.<br/><br/>- I publish my game!  It's for sale to a specific niche of RPG players.<br/><br/>- I publish my game!  It's for as wide an audience as possible.<br/><br/>- etc<br/><br/>For me, for example, I tend to publish firmly in the third option.  I know I don't want the fourth option.  Whenever the second option blends in with the third, it's nice, but it's not my focus.  <br/><br/>So probably all the things I'm wanting to say to you here are gonna be duds, because they're third-option ideas for Fastlane.  Unless you're looking for third-option too (as opposed to second option primary focus with a it-would-be-nice-to-get-the-third-option-occasionally blended in) you're right, we're pretty much at an end state.<br/><br/>So I'll bow out. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84684/#Comment_84684" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T10:50:19+00:00" title="August  1, 2007 10:50AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            iago points out something elegantly that I couldn't figure out any way to say except clumsily.

Therefore, I need packaging (here's where layout and artwork comes in) and other marketing strategies that will help me sell the game as much as I can, without impugning on or otherwise harming the game itself, while communicating as much as possible what the game is about."  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, it seems what people look for when they are marketed are specifically things that are harmful to <i>this</i> game, at least, as an object, and so I'm trying to see how far I can push the line without going over it. That's what this thread is about, and while <b>Fastlane</b> is the focal point, I'm hoping all these ideas are things that can help future people who might be in the same place as me, assuming they don't just add a setting or go with cover art just kind of automatically, because it's "what you do."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Your current roulette wheel cover looks like a casino how-to manual, not an RPG.</blockquote>\nYes, exactly!  This is what I was trying to communicate earlier as far as what the cover does to the game, that the simple fact that it wants a wheel does not.  I just wish I'd realized that before I printed 150 damned copies back in 2004 (so far my only print run), but I completely agree.  Also, apparently coil binding makes a lot of people sad and judgmental, or both, so the next printing will remove that (despite the nice features coil binding also has).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Word of mouth is almost certainly your primary tool, though, since FL doesn't appear on shelves.<br/><br/>If you have a website, post up sample scenario PDFs across a crazy ass variety of genres, for the express purpose of a) giving hints as to how the mechanics work and b) showing off that FL is a highly flexible engine (a la GURPS/HERO).

There are retail purchases of the game, and it technically appears on a "shelf" at both rpgnow and IPR (though the latter case, at least, probably mostly doesn't have people even get to the site without partially being plugged into the word-of-mouth network). That said, I agree with your point otherwise - it <i>effectively</i> doesn't appear on shelves for most practical purposes.<br/><br/>I do have a website, done all by myself by hand in notepad and as has been evidenced here on this thread I have no visual sense whatsoever apart from a vague idea of what I <i>don't</i> want, and I really can't afford to hire anyone to redesign it. There's already some stuff on the website, but mostly it's just stuff that happened to fall into my lap. I've never done any sort of driven marketing anything, certainly nothing close to what you're talking about.  But maybe I can whip something up, if you could give me a bit more of an idea what you're describing.  (Pre-designed scenarios have always been my weak point; I never even dealt with modules much when I was younger, and mostly improvised my games all my life)  <br/><br/>Heck, if it's something that good I can include it in the next printing of the <b>Fastlane</b> text also, so people don't have to go to my website to see it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Want reviewers to read the text and go, wow, cool, style? Examples that showcase the players aren't it.</blockquote>\nYes, but they <i>are</i> the clearest, and I've received numerous compliments about them. It's probably going to be one of the hallmarks of my work, as I've already got one in <b>Snowball</b> and in <b>Fastlane</b> and will have one in <b>Ensemble</b> as well.  I really like them, and I'm far from the only one, at least in terms of the compliments and praise I've gotten.<br/><br/>So that's out, because my first goal is <i>proper communication</i> of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">real product</span>, the game I hope people will play. But no worries - I'll find other ways to make "wow, style" happen, because I'm sure there's tons of them out there. Hopefully the use of microfiction, as iago mentioned early on, will be that answer to increased style (and also hopefully communicating more of the ephemera of the game). And perhaps a better layout (since adding microfiction will necessitate changing the layout anyway). And maybe this 4-8 page thing Paul is suggesting will help, too.  And better back-cover text.<br/><br/>There are ways, I have faith in that. And as much as so many people here are arguing for me to head down the beaten path, thank you for all of you (even the ones who are still trying to herd me that way) providing any suggestions and examples that I can latch onto and use instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84938/#Comment_84938" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T08:41:47+00:00" title="August  2, 2007  8:41AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Update:  I have managed to be talked out of the microfiction.

Didn't even realize I was addressed in this thread until I stumbled upon it.<br/><br/>First, I have an admission, and you're going to hate me.  I haven't read <i>Fastlane.</i>  It makes pretty good sense: everything I've heard about it said that it's not about anything but a roulette wheel.  Unless you want to play with d6s.  Frankly, that's not enough for me to want to borrow a copy, much less buy it.  Told you it was harsh and unfair.<br/><br/>And, I'm apologizing up front, the rest of this is pretty harsh as well.  It comes from a good place though.<br/><br/>GURPS is a generic system, and that's its hook.  GURPS Basic gives you a generic fantasy setting to play with, and the promise of dozens of world books.  It's right there in the Steve Jackson marketing materials circa 1985.  PtA is <i>about</i> television programs.  That's enough of a hook to be interested in.<br/><br/>But <i>Fastlane?</i> <i>Fastlane</i> is about nothing at all, is what I hear you fighting hard to assert.  Or "everything, all the time," which is scarcely better.  That's my take away on <i>Fastlane.</i><br/><br/>To help me be interested in your game, I need you to give me a hook to hang my interest on.  For myself, I'm not interested in pure generic systems.  There are people who are.  But I get the feeling that FL isn't just a generic system.  The title, inescapably, says "modern" to me.  That's a consequence of a still-current basis to the metaphor.  All the buzz I hear about the game, which amounts to your posts here, is that "no, it's not modern, it's not anything."  Which strikes me as doing a disservice to your game.<br/><br/>Constructive advice:<br/><br/>Speak positively about your game.  Do not negate statements about it without providing an alternative positive assertion.  <br/><br/>"It's not modern" is a losing battle.  You didn't mean to, but by naming it "Fastlane," you give the solid impression that it's a modern game.  Embrace it!  Give it a single rooted setting.  You don't have to go so far as giving it a canon, but you could do worse than making it "the game in the casino."  Fuck, I'd play that casino game right now.  Because that's really different.<br/><br/>Figure out what your game is about.  My preference is that "life on the edge" doesn't cut it.  That's either so broad as to be little better than "everything!" or the filler copy of every action movie trailer ever.  But like I said: just my preference.  Again, find a concrete setting that supports the theme really strongly - ideally one I haven't seen before.  Themes play a lot harder when they sneak up on you wearing a story.<br/><br/>Ask yourself (or even better, explain to me, because I just don't get it) why you feel like a concrete setting would be detrimental.  What virtue does FL have that would be injured by a concrete setting?<br/><br/>Granted that there are such virtues, you have a tougher road.  You need to be able to figure out what FL is about and push that three times as hard, because without the trappings of something concrete, you have a lot farther to go for you potential audience can answer the question "What's that Cherry guy getting at?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85157/#Comment_85157" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T18:33:03+00:00" title="August  2, 2007  6:33PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>Themes play a lot harder when they sneak up on you wearing a story.<br/></blockquote>\nI had to quote that, it's just so well phrased.<br/><br/>Judson, your post makes me realize anew: other games which are regularly kitbashed, the setting ripped out and replaced, get to the point where people do that to them because they had a setting in which people could understand how the game worked and think "I could do X with this instead!". I'm thinking Dogs, FATE, TSoY and so forth. They create a certain kind of story, a certain kind of play experience and a certain kind of thematic statement; people who want that recognize it through the veil of setting, and want to strip the setting off and skin on another setting where they can tell the same kind of story, have the same kind of experience and make the same kind of thematic statement, but using particular trappings that they prefer to the original setting for whatever reason.<br/><br/>But without the setting, that doesn't get to happen because people don't know what to do with the games; there's no world to make them concrete enough that you could visualize doing your own thing with them.<br/><br/>All of which is basically what you said, only wordier. But it confirms that I made a good decision when I decided to create a generic system designed to be kitbashed, but publish it with a setting as a demo of <i>how</i> it can be kitbashed.<br/><br/>I'm not sure where that leaves you, Lx.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85160/#Comment_85160" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T18:43:18+00:00" title="August  2, 2007  6:43PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know, it seems highly weird to <i>denigrate</i> a game by saying it's like GURPS - one of the most successful and critically acclaimed games of all time in the hobby.<br/><br/>if Fastlane is a generic "high action" game engine, which seems to be the case since it can be applied to a whole bunch of settings/situations, that's okay by me!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85166/#Comment_85166" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T20:21:22+00:00" title="August  2, 2007  8:21PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>To help me be interested in your game, I need you to give me a hook to hang my interest on.</blockquote>\nThen Judson, tell me how I can hook you <i>without</i> using Setting, especially a concrete setting.

(It doesn't; it exalts that vision.)<br/><br/>You think it does.<br/><br/>And dude... I'm sorry, you're just wrong.  And you're beating your head up against this constantly.  It's going to leave you with a bruised forehead and maybe a concussion, and it's not going to help your art at all.  <br/><br/>Sometimes you have to kill your babies.  For Fastlane to really fly, I am passionate in my insistence that you need to get over this hang-up of yours about the game, because it has neutered your vision.  It has made it nigh-impossible for you to communicate that the game is about something in any way that is evocative or excites others.  <i>Stories sell, but you aren't willing to tell them because stories have settings.</i>  You may as well say "I'm not willing to have people play the game."<br/><br/>Let's look at another settingless game -- Mortal Coil.  Mortal Coil does pretty well for itself.  But is it really settingless?<br/><br/>No, it's not.  Look at that art.  That art communicates a setting and a feel.  You can do all sorts of settings that aren't full of dark fucked up shit -- stuff that isn't, y'know, Jennifer Rodgers the animated series -- but the cover of that game, and the art inside it, still has a point of view.  It's willing to evoke, using specific setting(s) as the means to communicate what it wants to evoke: a world alive with magic.  <br/><br/>You've got to do that.  Got to.  Or, honestly -- stop worrying about publishing Fastlane.  Put it out there for free, and don't boat-anchor yourself with an incompatible mix of stubborn insistence on something that hurts your ability to sell a product and the desire to sell that product.<br/><br/>Sorry to go all tough love, man, but this conversation is looping in on itself, with people giving you all manner of road signs to your destination and you whittling off another inch or two from your legs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85292/#Comment_85292" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T08:14:33+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  8:14AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Alexander,<br/><br/>I suggest you take a long, long look at Sorcerer.

Here, let me try illustrating what it looks at from my end, using "X" to replace "Setting" because I wonder how much of this is reaction to the word/concept in question.\n<blockquote><cite>Summary</cite>Someone says. "This has no X, therefore I cannot get hooked."<br/><br/>I ask, "Okay, other than X, what other ways can you think of to get this done?"<br/><br/>People say, "Try using X."<br/><br/>I say, "No, that doesn't fall into the bounds of this question.  I'm asking what other than X can be used. Here is something that avoids X, how can I emulate it?"<br/><br/>People say, "I don't know.  Maybe try X?" (Some of these people seem to even be unaware that they're just repackaging "X" in different words)<br/><br/>I say again, "No, let us think outside of the box.  X is off limits..." and the cycle continues.<br/></blockquote>\nFrom this angle, it appears that X is so thoroughly ingrained in the psyche that a lot of people are incapable of looking past it, even as a thought experiment. The majority of posters in this thread are more interested in advocating X than even <i>trying</i> to find alternatives to X (even if some of them are acknowledging they may exist).  If I'm wrong about this, please correct me, but this is how it looks from this side.<br/><br/>And as a counterexample (though not the only one):\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>You need a story. That does not mean you need a setting.</blockquote>\nExactly!  And how best can I communicate the story of <b>Fastlane</b> without setting?  Perhaps that's how I need to phrase my question.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted by: iago</cite>Setting does not kill artistic vision. (It doesn't; it exalts that vision.)</blockquote>\nSetting can do <i>either</i>; neither the killing or the exaltation is a necessity. I am not against setting as a whole, and if that's what is coming across here, I apologize.  I am only talking specifically in the context of <b>Fastlane</b> and games like it (including PTA, I think Sorcerer but maybe not, and likely others).<br/><br/>You mention Dogs as an example.  Dogs is a place where the <i>Setting</i> and what it communicates <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is the artistic vision</span>.  The system, which is good on its own, translates well to other formats, but the vision includes the <i>setting</i>. The setting <i>exalted</i> the artistic vision because it was part of it.  The system did not lose any power, no.<br/><br/>I can't speak to Spirit of the Century, because I don't (and probably won't for various reasons, ever) own it.  But I want to emphasize again, I don't believe setting ever <i>robs a system of its power</i>, it can only <i>ruin the presentation</i>.  In a best case scenario, like Dogs, it integrates with the artistic vision.  In a worst case scenario, like GURPS, the setting does nothing but increase the page count and final cost.<br/><br/>And there are other games.  TSoY (where the setting and system, at least online, are completely separate entities, and even in the book worked that way; I honestly think you're buying two products at once when you buy the TSoY book, a rulebook and a setting book).  There's Burning Empires (where the system was effectively rebuilt to wrap around the setting in a very cool way that helped exalt the artistic vision).  <br/><br/>But all of these games (to my knowledge) don't have one thing that <b>Fastlane</b> does have (and incidentally, both PTA and Sorcerer also have):  a requisite step, in the "before the game" process, where the players all sit down and <i>come up with a setting</i>.  There's even mechanical support here, resources that need to be spent on a character web and stuff.  (Sorcerer requires the definition of Humanity, which is also a very important mechanical thing; PTA's is less mechanical, since the show doesn't get its own sheet, but is still necessary prior to character creation).  At the very least, putting a single, official setting in the book invalidates <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span>, not to mention contradicting it.<br/><br/>Actually, it's more than that (and this is me realizing this right now, so sorry if this is a bit unclear). <b>Fastlane</b> is a game of style over substance (the only substantial part of the game should be the PCs), and part of that has <i>always</i> meant setting. It does not ask you to create a setting, it asks you to create characters and a situation, which often requires or at least strongly suggests a setting.  And since setting can influence situations, it is a game where including a setting, or even including things that <i>bias</i> towards a particular setting, should be minimized, if not eliminated. <br/><br/>This is half the reason why I don't want to include art.  (The other half is... well, aesthetic - I think art is meaningless in most cases where there is no setting and does nothing but increase the price of the book for no increase in quality of the <i>game</i>, aka "art bloat", so I want to fight against the "art everywhere" meme on principals.)<br/><br/>If this thread has done nothing else, it's now made me tempted to find a few people and see if we can play a <i>settingless</i> game of <b>Fastlane</b>. Or at least, settingless before the scenes start taking place.  Just the relationship map and whatever is implied by the styles and Lifes.  Maybe even have the <i>setting explicitly change</i> each scene, keeping only the people and events the same. Anyone up for it at GenCon? Whisper me.  <br/><br/>Back to the topic.  I already have strikes against me and I don't want to muddy the waters by trying to throw counterstrikes, that just leads to global thermonuclear war.  My strikes are:<ul>\n<li>The wheel itself, which I cannot abandon because roulette is the core of the system (and even when people play with dice they'll still be thinking of the wheel).  Even though the modern roulette wheel was conceived of by some Renaissance mathematician, people still associate it with modernity. Getting the wheel off the cover will help (if nothing else, everyone in the thread agrees on that)<br/></li><li>The Example of Play, kind of (it's about the players, there's not even any description of a scene except second-hand, but they did pick a modern setting) - and I won't abandon the EoP either because it is directly from a playtest (and so very authentic) and serves to educate about the system well.<br/></li><li>And apparently, as of this thread, I have learned the goddamned <span style="text-decoration: underline;">title</span> still is something some people associate with a modern-only environment as well.  If that had been a worry back when I was designing it, I'd have picked a different title. This is still somewhat stuck in my craw, what the hell people?<br/></li></ul>\nMy only counterstrike in the text is a bullet-point of one-paragraph miniature settings ranging from fantasy to science fiction which gives starting points to those people who are more the "I dunno, what setting do you wanna do?" kind; maybe I should expand those but honestly, it feels like <i>a cop out</i> so I want to do that as little as possible.  When <b>Fastlane</b> first came out I had plans to do setting books, but that never happened either, life got in the way. Even now I'd rather have sample settings (as in "fleshed out and playable" settings) in their own books, if they have to exist at all.<br/><br/>I have at least one other idea I want to work into the next layout which will also give starting points but I'd still love to hear MORE ways to, as misuba condensed so wonderfully earlier, how to get across the <i>story</i> wtihout <span style="text-decoration: underline;">setting</span> (in general, and for my game). For <b>Fastlane</b> in particular, images are verboten for both personal and artistic reasons.<br/><br/>Okay, I might ramble even more, but I have to get to the chiropractor.  Hopefully this makes sense, I'm still on my loopy meds, after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

If that had been a worry back when I was designing it, I'd have picked a different title. This is still somewhat stuck in my craw, what the hell people?</blockquote>\nAs a quick experiment, I polled the people I work with as they came back from lunch with the question "If I told you the name of a game was <i>Fastlane</i>, what would you think that game would be like?" and 11 out of 12 people answered with "car racing" of some kind.  The twelfth person (our non-native English speaker) shrugged and said she had no idea at all.  So, yeah, the title seems to tell even non-gamers that your game is set in a modern environment, in that they immediately assume it's about driving.  <br/><br/><br/>For whatever it's worth, not only do I approve of the idea of omitting art, I also love the "setting-free" approach.  It saves my group the trouble of having to rip out all the setting information to replace it with the one we want to play in!  One paragraph descriptions or "play vignettes" illustrating lots of different ways of playing the game in lots of different settings is great fodder for us when we're figuring out what we want to do with a particular game, since I don't think any of us give a crap about what the developer's vision was.  (Most of the time we think the developer's vision is kind of lame and would rather just do our own thing.)<br/><br/>Given a blurb on the cover to tell us roughly what the game is for (not necessarily "about," just tell us what sort of game activities it's set up to handle), and a decent introduction that lays out what the game rules will cover and explicitly advises us that the setting and all things in it is up to us, and it's more or less exactly the kind of game that hits our sweet spot.<br/><br/>Well, except for the roulette wheel, anyway; there's just no way around the fact that we do not own a roulette wheel, nor will we ever.  If the dice mechanic feels like an unloved stepchild (always mentioned second if it's mentioned at all, fewer play examples using dice, a sense that the dice maybe aren't the best/first/optimum mechanic for the game), it'll be an incredibly tough sell.  We've got plenty of games that do cool action, so even the perception that a game's system isn't smoother than silk is enough to bump it off our "play next" list.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85423/#Comment_85423" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T15:23:42+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  3:23PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alexander:<br/><br/>Publish your setting books but make them complete books in and of themselves by including the system material.<br/><br/>Done and done.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85447/#Comment_85447" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T17:59:23+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  5:59PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lxndr</cite><br/><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>You need a story.

That is, it needs the "PTA is about TV, what is Fastlane about" question answered to give people something to latch onto with their advice.<br/><br/>I have to say that the website doesn't do a great job of communicating this either (thus this thread, I suppose\xe2\u20ac\xa6), but this seems to get the idea across:\n<blockquote><cite>Alexander Cherry's promo text for Fastlane</cite><br/>The future is always uncertain - it is full of unfulfilled promises, and terrible predictions that never come to pass. No plan ever survives contact with the enemy, and the future is the enemy of all our lives - a march through the darkness that will eventually end in our deaths; maybe tomorrow, maybe fifty years from now. Still, people keep on planning, as if they can control the future; and usually, things more or less work out in the long run.<br/><br/>Fastlane isn't about the long run. It isn't about the future, or the past. It's about the NOW.<br/><br/>No matter where you go, there's always people willing to devote themselves to feeding their carnal appetites, indulging their whims, burning their candles at both ends knowing full well that at any time they can burn out. These people don't think about the future any more than necessary - either by choice or through circumstance, they just try to make it through each day, one at a time, consequences be damned.<br/><br/>Characters in Fastlane left moderation on the side of the road a long time ago. They run through their world at ever-increasing speeds, feeding off the adrenaline highs, trying to find that lucky break while holding desperately to the last things that give their lives meaning. Around them, people are passed around like pills and needles, used up and tossed aside; the guy who stabbed you in the back this morning could be your drinking buddy tonight, and the girl you take home will be hanging on someone else's arm tomorrow. Everyone's out for themselves - alliances and rivalries are a matter of convenience, paid for in the currency of the favor.<br/><br/>Attitude and passion are the key in Fastlane. As a character, you can get a bonus when you go after what matters most, or when acting according to your own style. And as a player, you get to decide how much risk you're willing to take - and the bigger the risk, the bigger the reward if you make it; hopefully big enough to keep you from burning out one more day.</blockquote>\nHopefully this will help create a little forward momentum for this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85631/#Comment_85631" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-05T09:34:55+00:00" title="August  5, 2007  9:34AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An RPG with no setting is useless to me.

I'm going to make some uneducated guesses here; tell me where I'm wrong.<br/><br/>* Fastlane expresses a certain style and attitude of play<br/><br/>* FL addresses certain thematic issues (which, frankly, are not yet clear to me based only on promotional materials and chatting about FL with you)<br/><br/>* It is your position that FL can accomplish style, attitude and theme absent specific setting details. <br/><br/>True? Tell me if I'm right or wrong and we'll go from there. Just so we're on the same page, I'm using some language I want to be very clear on (it's not Forgespeak; I don't care and you shouldn't either):<br/><br/>"Expresses" = The net product of game play. IOW, your design goal is to make game play via FL produce a style and attitude of your designation.<br/><br/>"Addresses" = What you want game play to "talk about." Yes, highly controversial and I've heard all the pedantry about whether a game can be "about" anything. I believe you wrote FL to address a list of issues, so let's start with your intent. Are those issues explicit in the text or are they implied via actual play?<br/><br/>As a thought exercise it's a very interesting question. I have some ideas on how to proceed but I want to make sure we're on the same page here.

However, as a caveat, I've only played with Lx, so it's quite possible that that style and attitude was brought to the table by Lx himself. However, I believe given how my own style of play was different when playing Fastlane than when playing other games (we generally had two campaigns going during that period; My TRoS and his whatever other indie game) that the rules strong encourage the live fast, burn the candle at both ends attitude. At one point, I was in a contest with another PC, and won by a margin of 10 chips. I tried to turn those chips into a 10-point favor, but when he refused to owe me, I humbled him, badly. I'm not one of those that's totally against PC-PC conflict, but in general, I prefer a little more cooperative play. By doing so, I sharply curtailed his contributions to the game, until later on when his lucky number came up. The final scene, where he tried to blow up the ship my character was on, was... Pretty intense. If I'd not hit my own lucky number twice during play, I'd have had my character die, and fail in everything he was trying to do. And I think I'd have been okay with that, because burnout and loss is part of the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for addressing thematic issues... I'm a little more iffy. I mean, sure, it's almost certain that you're going to be put in a situation where you've got two different favors or factions pulling you in different directions. Loyalty, sacrifice, addiction and obsession are the common themes of Fastlane. But this depends on the GM and players wanting to address those themes. I think that, if the group didn't want to address any such issues, they wouldn't face any real pressure from the mechanics to do so. But the attitude of favors, debts, shifting loyalties and alliances is pretty much mandatory, given how the rules work. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this and no setting: Yes, definitely. The hard part is in expressing this to people without specific setting. That is to say, it can be expressed in any setting; The idea of "live fast, die young and leave a good looking corpse" is equally familiar to swashbuckling lady's men in the Caribbean, scrappy street-rat computer whizzes, and dapper, dashing gamblers. Likewise, the themes mentioned above can be addressed by a Lancelot, Guinevere and Arthur, or by people planning an 1001 Arabian Nights style heist. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for whether or not the game would be hurt by a specific "default" setting.. I'm on the fence. Dogs in the Vineyard certainly is, even though you couldn't tell by it's wild success. I was heavily resistant to playing it for quite some time because of it's setting. Once I finally got frustrated with his persistence and gave in, and let Lx tell me about it, the mechanics captured my interest, and Actual Play reports sold me on the setting... But the setting was originally very offputting, and is the reason why I've never played it with any group that wasn't based around Lx and myself. Basically, Lx doesn't want people to look at Fastlane and go "Oh, it's just a game about X" and dismiss it, even when those people might very much enjoy it, as I enjoyed Dogs in the Vineyard. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, including settings, plural, as he currently has, and through situation-exposing fictional vignettes, doesn't seem like a bad idea to me. It doesn't tie the game to one setting, and it can help illustrate what the game is about better than someone just telling you what it's supposed to be about. This is a game where Actual Play will sell it better than any elevator pitch. I've yet to hear of or read an Actual Play report of Fastlane that didn't sound awesome, but if Lx were trying to sell me on the game just by talking about it, I'd probably pass, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne final note about the roulette wheel: I love the wheel. I am resistant to any efforts to remove or de-emphasize the wheel. That isn't to say that the dice mechanic shouldn't be emphasized, but I think the game plays much better, and is a great deal more fun with the wheel. You can enjoy the game with the dice, I'm utterly certain of that. But if you dismiss the wheel, then you're missing out on something that really helps make the game what it is. Maybe the dice should be moved up to being the "default" way to play, with the wheel being a strongly encouraged alternate, but I definitely support that it be STRONGLY encouraged.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87515/#Comment_87515" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-11T10:24:44+00:00" title="August 11, 2007 10:24AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2007 10:26AM by PaulB.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, on to the thought experiment part of the show.<br/><br/>FL distinguishes itself by:<br/><br/>* Supporting a style of play that is, presumably, not well-supported through other means. &lt;&lt;-- this to me is the big marketing question of FL. Is it true or mere assertion that the FL engine (and its various procedures, decisions, etc.) produces a measurably different experience from other conflict-focused engines? I'd like to dig in a bit about &lt;i&gt;how the FL experience is different than the DitV experience, the Burning whatever experience, the ORE experience, etc.<br/><br/>* Generating a play experience (ie "the story") that results from that play style. <br/><br/>* A novel mechanic that "requires" the use of a difficult-to-acquire piece of hardware.<br/><br/>Okay, so let's assume the game shines when it's addressing what it's designed to address: Conflicts based on high-stakes gambles made by characters who can't afford to lose.<br/><br/>So we need a way to a) give those conflicts context and b) reach out to players to whom that idea is appealing.<br/><br/>First bit. To my mind, the heavy reliance on setting materials in most games is to give the conflicts context. FL by itself is a contextless engine, not what one would think of as a fully realized "game." It's good that the game already includes starter settings. THIS NEEDS TO BE MADE ABUNDANTLY OBVIOUS. Otherwise, the message I get from the game is, "Here's a cool way to frame and resolve conflicts, but you still have a lot of work to do to before you get to start playing."<br/><br/>Conflict without context has no emotional or imaginative touchpoint for the participants. There's no reason to opt into the conflict because there's nothing at stake for the player (other than "winning").<br/><br/>Okay, so how do you frame and resolve conflicts without using setting details for context? <i>Genre</i> comes to mind: take a long, hard deconstructive look at a genre or two in which "live fast, die young" is a guiding principle. Example: Swashbuckling High Seas Piracy. Rather that enumerating which fake nations use which fake boats, we tear into the ways in which Swashbuckling High Seas Piracy addresses "live fast, die young." The net result is a critical analysis of the genre written in such a way that situations (conflict + context) literally leap off the page at the reader. This is the way Shock: deals with its subject matter. The genre is social science fiction; the setting is irrelevant.<br/><br/>Another way to frame and resolve conflicts: Mechanically build situation into the game setup. This might be as simple as a checklist: genre, location, name three things that are important to you, what would you kill for, how many turns or sessions will this game feature, each player provides two details about the location, etc. etc.  Or it could be a more involved point-buy type of thing a la <i>Burning Empires</i>. There is shockingly little setting material in that game, yet the game's conflicts are packed solid with context. You lay out the situations in the beginning and go from there.<br/><br/>Now...the second question. How do you reach out to players to whom the idea of play driven by high-stakes gambles is appealing? <br/><br/>I'm not convinced you can really sell a game to someone who isn't already interested in the theme, subject matter, what-have-you. Most published games get around this by offering a little something to everyone: You might not like the setting but the engine is cool; I'm not a mechanic-oriented player but I like the resulting game play. Whatever.<br/><br/>Actual Play isn't bad but I really think y'all have a higher opinion of it than you should. If you're gonna post AP, it MUST be snappier than 99% of the gamer writing that's out there. IT. MUST. BE. BETTER.<br/><br/>A set of demos -- sample situations and characters -- would do wonders in showing off that FL is a highly flexible settingless engine.<br/><br/>Possibly a quickstart rules giveaway. Don't describe all the various bets you can make, just sketch out the extreme basics of the game so you can play through the demos without buying the game. Since FL is a contextless engine, you might as well let people look under the hood. My intuition is that the value-add, the thing people will spend money on, is the work the author puts into making the engine immediately useable.

It's something ideally done as part of character creation, tho' I suppose if a GM wanted, it could be done prior, and the setting could just be presented to the players before character creation. It's been a while since I've sat down and read through it, but it's pretty integral. Even if you have a setting in mind, tailoring that setting to your characters and their situation must be done before you can begin play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87523/#Comment_87523" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-11T11:11:24+00:00" title="August 11, 2007 11:11AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No I have not played.
