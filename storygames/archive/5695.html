Last week we did chargen, but we didn\u2019t actually play until a couple days ago.  It\u2019s been an interesting go so far.  So, let\u2019s dive in!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Getting Started</b><br/>\n<br/>\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning:  pitching the game to the group.  Just how does one go about summarizing <i>Nine Worlds</i> to his fellow players?  My attempts were two-fold:  \u201cGreek heroes in spaaaace!\u201d and \u201cMage and Nobilis, done indie-style\u201d.  The second was for my wife, who doesn\u2019t really know Greek myth, but who has happy memories of both Mage and Nobilis.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a similar problem with creating characters.  I knew that Ralph was familiar with the backstory of the game, but I didn\u2019t want to require my other players to read all the <i>Nine Worlds</i> backstory.  So, how to get them up to speed quickly?  At one point, I was going to suggest that Crystal and Keith play brand new Archons starting on Earth, letting the character ignorance provide learning opportunities for the players.  And, if this were to be a long-term game, I might have gone that route.  But, as I\u2019m thinking that this will probably be a game that\u2019s only a few sessions long, I didn\u2019t think that it would be as enjoyable for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen a thought occurred to me.  The setting of <i>Nine Worlds</i> is actually like the setting of <i>Legends of Alyria</i>.  The point isn\u2019t about providing a full-blown portrait of the world; rather, it\u2019s about communicating a particular vibe and then using setting to communicate specific potential conflicts.  Realizing this, I dipped into my bag of <i>Legends of Alyria</i> tricks.  When we sat down to create characters, I gave a high-level overview of the setting concepts (\u201cthis is a Titan\u201d, \u201cthis is an Archon\u201d, and suchlike).  Then I gave basic overviews of the nine worlds, giving a basic sketch of the physical nature of the world, along with its feel.  (e.g.  \u201cMercury is the hub of trade for the Nine Worlds\u201d, \u201cJupiter is an Orwellian dictatorship\u201d)  Once that was done, I asked each player for their top two choices, and we haggled from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seemed to work out fairly well and led naturally into a discussion of character concepts and the like.  In the end, I think that everyone was happy with what they got.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe decided to set the game on Jupiter, at least to start.  I made it clear that this was just the starting point for our game and that we weren\u2019t trapped on this world somehow.  Crystal chose to play Quannus, a psychotic Aegis agent, high up in the ranks, but gunning for top spot instead of Herakles.  Keith created Vulcan, a ex-Archer Foundation agent, now a freelance merchant, engineer, and \u201ctroubleshooter\u201d, trying to do business with Aegis.  Ralph created Kalycos, a Thanatoi dispatched to Jupiter by Hades to recover the soul of Hector\u2026and collect Herakles as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll very cool.  I also explained how we were going to focus the game on player vs. player conflict.  Again, a la <i>Legends of Alyria</i>, the PCs would be the primary source of antagonism to each other.  At least in theory.  So, rather than party-oriented play, which spirals outward into the unknown, we\u2019d have PvP play, which would tend to spiral inwards toward each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Prepping the Game</b><br/>\n<br/>\nSo, how to prep for this game?  Originally, I had planned on making a storymap and then having players select their characters.  But, the prep session morphed away from this.  Now I had a collection of PCs and their various Muses.  I had encouraged the players to make up NPCs as parts of their Muses, so I had a few of those.  But now what to do?<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking of prepping <i>Sorcerer</i>-style, with a relationship map and such.  Then I\u2019d choose a Muse from each character as a \u201cKicker\u201d of sorts, craft opening scenes for each one, and then off we\u2019d go!<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo things stopped me from doing this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first was the philosophy of <i>Nine Worlds</i>.  This is a game that\u2019s all about questioning the authority of the Game Master, right?  So why should I be prepping opening scenes and having my own situation in place?  Shouldn\u2019t I let the players give their characters a shove, and then see where everything goes?  (Reminded me a bit of <i>Land of 1000 Kings</i>, actually.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second was laziness.  It\u2019s easier to make the players do this work, instead of my laying it out in advance.  Yeah, Ralph, I admit it.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, I decided to do this.    The book lays out the idea of going around the table to frame scenes, so I decided that we\u2019d go with that.  But, for the first go-around, I had each player select one of his starting Muses.  Then I told them to craft a starting scene for their characters involving that Muse.  And we were off!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127341/#Comment_127341" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T15:03:58+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  3:03PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>What Happened in Play</b><br/>\n<br/>\nWe open with Quannus slipping into the home of the clerk who recently performed a psychological engineering evaluation on her, which revealed the dark side of her personality, including her desire to supplant Herakles.  The clerk is playing with his baby, but that doesn\u2019t stop Quannus, who steps behind him, reaches into his body, and grabs hold of his soul.  When it refuses to give, she begins whispering evil lies in his ear, destroying his will to live.  Finally, the clerk\u2019s soul releases, slipping free of his body.  The baby falls to the floor, and Quannus makes her escape.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, pretty disturbing opening.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, we cut to Vulcan, who set up a meeting with Herakles to demonstrate his new technology in an attempt to land a contract with Aegis, including manufacturing his latest and best invention, the Black Wolf Power Armor.  Herakles is impressed with the demonstration.  So impressed, in fact, that he seizes the plans from Vulcan and has him escorted from the building.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we cut to Kalycos, who slips into the clerk\u2019s home.  The baby is dead, so he collects the soul for safe-keeping, until he can return to the Underworld and deposit it.  But, when he goes to collect the soul of the clerk, he finds it missing.  So, he tracks its trail to Quannus, who just realized that, in the thrill of the kill, she had forgotten to steal the file with her evaluation in it.  The file that Kalycos had conveniently taken with him.  They face off but Kalycos is the quicker, seizing the clerk\u2019s soul from Quannus.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to Vulcan, who has decided that he wants to recover his stolen plans.  So he breaks into Aegis headquarters, evading security, locates the area where the plans are being kept, and cons the clerk into handing them over, claiming that they were being transferred to an \u201coff-site\u201d facility.  So Vulcan makes good his escape.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the interim, Quannus made contact with Reagus, her contact with the Titans.  Why is she contacting the Titans?  We don\u2019t know yet.  (And when I say \u201cwe\u201d, I include all the players.)  Maybe she is a turncoat.  Maybe she\u2019s a double agent.  Maybe she\u2019s being set up.  Who can say?  However, Reagus turns out to be the clerk that Vulcan conned.  So, Reagus knows about the Black Wolf Power Armor, but he doesn\u2019t know that Aegis just lost control of the plans.  So he tells Quannus that the Titans would be greatly aided by acquiring the plans for this power armor.  So Quannus goes off to track down the plans.  Vulcan manages to cover his trail well, and leads her to a set of fake plans in a locker at the aetherport, which is being staked out by Aegis agents.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, of course, the agents move in to arrest Quannus.  Their leader, Jericho, is a rival of Quannus\u2019s, so he is especially pleased to be taking her down.  Quannus tries to talk her way out of the situation, using her supernaturally persuasive voice, while her Inner Death (a Talisman that is essentially a slice of her soul, given free rein to roam) goes about disarming the agents.  The rest of the squad is held at bay, but Jericho is able to arrest Quannus, hauling her off to jail with a maximum of media attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nCut back to Kalycos.  He\u2019s located Hector\u2019s ghost; Herakles is keeping him around as an adviser.  Kalycos goes to talk to Herakles, reminding him of the law regarding the dead.  He\u2019s very polite.  Herakles respects Kalycos\u2019 position but requests an extension of time, citing the current crisis.  Ninety days is all Herakles asks for.  Kalycos continues to be polite as he points out that Herakles himself is overdue in the Underworld.  Is he a lawbreaker also?  Hector heeds Kalycos\u2019s words, as he is a man of honor, but Herakles throws Kalycos out of his office.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that\u2019s where we wrapped for the night.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127342/#Comment_127342" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T15:04:24+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  3:04PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Post Game Thoughts</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn\u2019t a deep, introspective game.  Rather, it\u2019s more of an action movie, with kewl people doing kewl stuff with kewl powerz.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like it!<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m also enjoying the \u201cinward spiral\u201d of events, as we continue to take various peripheral entities from the various PCs and tie them together in a tangled mess of events.  The plans for the Black Wolf Power Armor make for a great MacGuffin, and the various crossing of characters seems to be working well to draw the characters further into inexorable conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also finding that introducing and statting NPCs is the biggest trick for this game.  Granted, at least part of this is my rustiness with balancing \u201ccombat\u201d encounters.  I  tried to follow the advice given in <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23839.0" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>, when I wasn\u2019t pulling stats from the book.  In general, I probably undershot, as most of the characters the Archons dealt with weren\u2019t really all that powerful and, in a game dedicated to player authority, I am particularly concerned about overriding that simply by bludgeoning the PCs with uber-NPCs.   Jericho was statted out around starting Archon level, though, and was able to take on Quannus effectively.  Of course, some of this is the result of players learning the system, which leads naturally into\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>My Thoughts on the Nine Worlds System</b><br/>\n<br/>\nIt occurred to me that <i>Nine Worlds</i> is a Euro-style roleplaying game.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me explain.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the last ten to fifteen years, there\u2019s been an invasion of the United States by a new breed of boardgame.  Most of these come from Germany and, more broadly, from Europe, and feature specific named designers (e.g. Reiner Knizia, Wolfgang Kramer), as opposed to a company\u2019s branding (e.g. Parker Brothers, Milton Bradley).  These games tend to focus on mechanics first, with a different understanding of the connection between mechanics and theme.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of these games are economics games, such as <i>Caylus</i>, <i>Princes of Florence</i>, and <i>Puerto Rico</i>.  In these games, you have to develop an economic infrastructure, enabling the gathering of resources that enable you to build up your infrastructure further, eventually enabling you to perform the necessary buying/selling/shipping/whatever necessary to earn victory points and, ultimately, win the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat\u2019s also quite possibly the driest, most boring explanation of these games.  EVAR.  Because they are actually a lot of fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, good play in these games requires that you understand the mechanics of how Resource A is gathered, converted into Resource B, spent to increase Infrastructure which allows you to collect Resource C, which, in turn, delivers victory points.  You have to do a great deal of look-ahead and understand how the decisions that you are making <i>now</i> shape your effectiveness <i>later</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is exactly what the <i>Nine Worlds</i> system requires.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn first look, the system doesn\u2019t actually seem like much.  Draw a bunch of cards (the more, the better), and pick whatever gives you the best value.  Ooh yay.  And then there\u2019s this bit about a victor being able to choose to go another phase.  Why would you ever do that?  I mean, if you won conflict, then you <i>won</i>, right?  At the same time, there feels like lots of fiddly bits.  Just like some of the best Eurogames, <i>Nine Worlds</i> simultaneously feels like there\u2019s not enough in the game while feeling overly complicated.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut no.  Because, see, conflict also results in Points (Resource A), which are then invested in Infrastructure (Muses and temporary Urge and Virtue ratings), which allow a superior outcome in future conflict.  Of course, to take advantage of your temporary ratings, you need to go another phase in conflict, especially hoping to get some Stasis to lock your temporary gains into a more permanent form.  Then, of course, there\u2019s the need to earn the right majority of victories on a given Muse before resolving it, so that you can earn Valor or Hubris (Resources B and C), thus allowing you to improve your Infrastructure in other ways, thus allowing you to better overcome in conflict.  Of course, your long-term Infrastructure and your best means of running this engine is through multiple overlapping Muses.  Therefore, you need to plan your Muses as stepping stones through the fiction, racking up their ratings and using them to fuel yourself\u2026.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt\u2019s very clever, actually, and I think that the \u201cgame-y\u201d aspects of it will become a lot of fun in play.  In particular, I think that Crystal will come to enjoy this angle of play.  However, that requires a level of proficiency with the system that the players are still developing.  It\u2019s not D&amp;D;, but <i>Nine Worlds</i> has a significant tactical element to it that could be easily overlooked by someone expecting a \u201chippy storygame\u201d experience from the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to tip my hat to you, Matt.  It wasn\u2019t at all what I was expecting from the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I like it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127375/#Comment_127375" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T18:22:36+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  6:22PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Seth.

In American games, the expectation is that the players will engage primarily with the theme and that the mechanics exist to support the theme.  In Euro games, particularly German designer games, the expectation is that the players will engage primarily with the mechanics, and that the theme exists to support the mechanics.<br><br>Now, to be clear, this doesn't mean that theme and mechanics are divisible.  I think that both types of games depend on mutual support between theme and mechanics.  It's a matter of emphasis.<br><br>I'm not alone in noting this.  Reiner Knizia discusses this in <a href="http://gametable.blogspot.com/2006/04/reiner-knizia-by-numbers.html" rel="nofollow">this interview</a>:\n<blockquote>Knizia has been successful getting games published in both the US and Europe, but acknowledges that the markets are different. Says Knizia, "In America, the theme is seen as the game where as in the European the game mechanics and the game system are seen as the game." Knizia tells a story about when he took a game prototype to America. It had an Egyptian theme and when an American publisher saw the theme they said, "We are not interested in this game, we have a game about Egypt and we don't need another." So Egypt was the game to them. Knizia asked them "Won't you at least have a look at it?" and they said no, we don't want this game. A few weeks later he was back in Germany showed the same game to a German publisher. The publisher sees the game has an Egyptian theme and says "Oh, are just in preparation of an Egyptian-themed game, so the Egyptian theme wouldn't work for us. But let's see the game first and then we can see what we'll do about the theme." In Germany the game was not the theme, but the game system. So there is a very different perception of what is a "game." For Knizia, that understanding is the starting point for what games he offers to the different markets.</blockquote>\nThis emphasis does tend to lead in different directions when it comes to the mechanical design.  For an American game, "theme" often translates into "chrome", having special rules designed to fit a given special case, providing a specific feel.  For a German game, "theme" tends to be more abstractly associated with mechanics, while attempting to craft a superior game mechanic.<br><br>So, to bring this back to the case at hand, let's compare the d20 system and Nine Worlds.  Let's set up a similar situation.  An Archon is facing down a large monster.<br><br>Now, in Nine Worlds, what are we concerned about?  Maximizing Fate value via the draw, while still generating enough Points to be able to generate useful Urge effects.  So, maybe, I need to strategize how to earn a bunch of Chaos points so I can slap this monster down hard.  So we go to conflict, which results in a victor, as well as information regarding the Urges that we used.  Then we narrate in retrospect what happened as a result of this mechanical outcome.  "The Archon runs up the side of a wall and hacks off one of the monster's heads.  I'm using my three Chaos points to reduce his Power by three.  Now let's go another phase.  Maybe I can lock that in place!"  Of course, the loss of a head is Color.  Nifty, but without any mechanical effect.  The important part is the temporary Power reduction.  This entire mechanical sequence could have been played out with a number of other possible narrations with the same mechanical effect.  For example, this could just as easily have represented a vigorous debate without a single mechanical adjustment.<br><br>In d20, what are we concerned about?  What stats and skills do each combatant have?  What about equipment?  Any magical abilities that need to be included here?  What are the relative positionings of the characters?  So, maybe, I need to strategize how to maneuver myself to a superior location, so that I can pick up an AC bonus of some kind.  Or, better yet, maybe I can make a skill roll that will justify a bonus to my attack roll for doing something unexpected.  Here goes....  "I roll for my Ubercool move.  Success!  Now I get a +5 to my attack roll.  I hit!  Roll for damage.  30 points of damage!  Great!  But now I'll need to maneuver out of the way...."  There's no way that this series of mechanical effects could represent a radically different narration.  A debate simply wouldn't work this way.<br><br>Also, there's just something in the feel of the two games that's different.  On some level, d20 is about mastering the opposition through manipulating the situation through attack rolls, skill checks and the like.  Nine Worlds has more of the Euro feel, where I'm trying to master the opposition through manipulating the system, not the situation.<br><br>Um.

YES, it has no mechanical effect, certainly true. But, the head is gone. This is now part of the fiction of the game. Getting it back? Yes, absolutely possible. Have someone, anyone win ANOTHER victory and narrate it so. <br><br>This is an important part about the game that I can say more confidently is overlooked. It means that there's a tad bit more manipulation of situation than you're indicating in your comparison, Seth. But, I think your overal point rocks. (I mean, hey, there's worse things to be compared to for starters!)<br><br>For example, say you narrate, "And then the Titan EATS your girlfriend!" This happens, even without mechanical effect. She gets eaten. Now, you've got to get her out again (ew!). Guess how? Win a victory in a conflict, presumably with the Titan. So, it's not just color. (Also, the GM could just relent and "let" her out again without conflict, I guess.  Boring.)<br><br>If the girlfriend suffers no other mechanical effect, she still has one hell of a narrative constraint! She's in the belly of a Titan. But? She is probably as effective as she was prior to being in there, mechanically speaking. (Assuming she's even a supporting or main character in the first place, that is.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127673/#Comment_127673" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T11:52:18+00:00" title="February 19, 2008 11:52AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fair point, Matt.

Firstly, as mentioned above, the relatively priorities of mechanical engagement vs theme, but also a part of the Euro board game design philosophy is maximizing the density of decision points over time.  In the classic old school American strategy design, there is lots of counter pushing that requires no meaningful decision making, but which provides simulation of the theme under consideration.  Whereas a Euro will typically collapse or eliminate such simulation aspects in favor of maximizing the density of meaningful decision points.<br>\n<br>\nAnalogously, Story Game designs have focused on increasing the density of meaningful narrative choice points over time, compared to the classic D&amp;D descended RPGs.  By abstracting the mechanics away from simulating the imagined action, busy work is eliminated that allows the narrative to be quickly moved from significant conflict to significant outcome.  However just as with Euro games, too much abstraction can lead to a feeling of disconnect from the putative theme.  So as with any design, its all about balancing to taste.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127826/#Comment_127826" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T17:47:45+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  5:47PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the collapsing in both cases is rooted in the modern lifestyle and just plain 1) not having time to play games that take 8 hours a session to play, and 2) there being so many other things clamoring for our attention that each thing needs to be brief enough to leave room for other things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127851/#Comment_127851" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T19:34:02+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  7:34PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I see where this is going.

For example, when designing an American RPG, you tend to think of as many real-life conditions as you can and apply numbers to them. That is why they are such awfully bloated things. They try to reduce the complexity of life to numbers.<br>\n<br>\nWhile playing Nine Worlds, I habitually kept stating how I would approach a problem in real life, and Seth would have to stop me and get me to draw my cards and look at them first. That is because the flow of thought in Nine Worlds goes from Abstract to Concrete.
