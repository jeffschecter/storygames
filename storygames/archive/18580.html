I figure it's a real promising buy for 13th Age players as well. I've been going through my copy for a few days now.<br/><br/>I'm always disappointed in fantasy miniatures because I can never find a good one to represent my character, especially female characters. Well, this is basically a collection of a gajillion tons of Pathfinder art (so men and women, about a 60-40 split (!), featuring awesome, detailed, fantastical and cool wear) turned into hard, thick, cardboard character blanks plus plastic bases for use with battlemats. Games like FATE and 13th Age with "zones", you can put them on their bases, or just leave them flat on the table.<br/><br/>Going through each punch-out sheet of dozens and dozens of characters, I hit upon one character inspiration after another; tons of characters from "Evil Cultist Woman" to "Arcane Scholar" where half of me is like, "Oh, man, this would have been the perfect mini to use for that X game I played Y years ago", and the other half is "Oh, dude, I want my next character to BE HER!". <br/><br/>It's not as useful in a capacity of "I need 20 detailed NPCs that all look alike to use as canon fodder", this set has duplicates for combat, but maybe only 2-4 tops. Most of the time I can see using them with Halma Pawns: "These 5 pawns are cultists; but this one over here stands out (drops NPC)", stuff like that.<br/><br/>Lots of minis, almost a 50-50 male/female split, very little cheesecake. <br/><br/>Only drawback is that they're mostly all "badasses": Actiony, dark-hero types, most of them wearing SeriousFace or GrimDark reactions. So it won't work as well for, say, Ryuutama or Your Happy Honobono Adventure Game, etc. But 90% of D&amp;D-like games, absolutely.<br/><br/><a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8x1f?Pathfinder-Pawns-NPC-Codex-Box" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://paizo.com/products/btpy8x1f?Pathfinder-Pawns-NPC-Codex-Box</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417765/#Comment_417765" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-04T10:07:53+00:00" title="July  4, 2013 10:07AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, oops!

A nice collection of those can inspire adventures the way the minis stand ups inspire characters.<br/><br/>They can even be nice for that sort of thing when the game doesn't have mechanically fiddly rules involved. Inspirational art is inspirational.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417784/#Comment_417784" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-04T20:35:29+00:00" title="July  4, 2013  8:35PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The NPC Codex book is also a great resource!
