                    The <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2412&amp;page=1#Item_46" rel="nofollow">Weird Old Games thread</a> really started dipping into nostalgia, so let's talk about the killer old stuff here.  Maybe they were chock full of great ideas saddled with a terrible system, or maybe they had innovative rules in service of a tedious setting.  Or maybe they were just throw-the-devil-horns-awesome.  <br/><br/>One that was mentioned over yonder and gets my vote is Fringeworthy, which is a wonderful "paths to infinity" sort of concept wrapped up with an extremely loose but compelling backstory.  The Mellor, shape-shifting villains that over-ran the  interdimensional paths, wiped out their gentle creators and like to eat people's brains, are some of the scariest shit I've ever seen in a game.  Our IDET team used to have regular blood draws ... <i>just to be sure. </i> I'll also point out that Fringeworthy's two published supplements deal with a)Dawn of the fuckin' Dead and b)Red fuckin' Dawn!                </div>

                            Twilight: 2000! It had awesome player-generated power where you had a list of contacts, like "1 military contact, 2 academic contacts (1 foreign)" and you could spend these in the game to say, "I know this guy in this scene - we were in training together," even if that guy was currently engaged in making you very physically unhappy.                        </div>

                            Also, Twilight: 2000 has the easiest, best, and most realistic auto-fire rules ever. Roll as many d6's as you shoot bullets. All 6's hit.                        </div>

<p>How could I not mention The Fantasy Trip? Especially since it's already been hinted at a couple times? It was the first RPG I saw that had a unified resolution system that applied to almost everything: roll multiple dice below one of your three stats for success; more difficult situations add more dice, talents can either modify your stats or reduce the number of dice you roll.  Looking back, some of the rules seem unnecessarily complicated, like consulting (admittedly short) tables of possible DX adjustments, and the rule books were written in the days before indexing and organization were invented (it was hard to find specific rules even with the gamemaster's codex, which really wasn't very well organized itself.) But still, going from early D&amp;D, with its standard character classes and no skills (yet) to TFT with its early "build a character" approach was an eyeopener and great fun. Plus, it had some interesting twists on bog-standard fantasy: no divine magic (and maybe no gods?), vampirism is a biological disease, gargoyles are a PC race, powerstones show up for the first time, alchemical bombs and molotov cocktails are standard equipment... it was a pretty good game.</p>

                            TFT was and is one of my all-time favorites.  Sure, nowadays there are a lot of innovative systems that do what it did better than it did 'em.  But it was the first class-free, point build system I ever found (I'm told it wasn't the first published, but it's my first such game).  It was also very rules-lite for the time.  It very much reflected its roots as a miniatures/combat game, but it was easy to ignore these bits.  I have an old friend who still loves to play occasionally.<br/><br/>Traveller - The first Science Fiction game I played, and the only game I played where character death was a very real possibility during character creation.  Imagine rolling to see if your character survives his term in the military.                        </div>

                            I have a soft spot in my heart for Top Secret.  We played the shit of that game and loved every second of it (SI brought setting bagage we wanted no part of).  Working for the "Agency" was just too damn cool.  That and TMNT are kinda my first passion in role-playing                        </div>

                            My head starts to cloud when I think back further than AD&amp;D 2E, Shadowrun, Paranoia 2E, so I'll throw out...<br/><br/>TOON.  At first, I thought it was a fast and silly game of cartoon antics.  Then I got the Toon Spoofy Campaign Thingy (with options for various genres like Fantasy, Star Trek, etc) and it became a great example on how a game meant for one thing could be a game meant for other things: I ended up bringing TOON to scout camps and the like, and we used it to game everything from sci fi to fantasy. It was easy and only required a few dice.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Gamma World for sure; I went crazy on eBay a few years ago and now have every edition. The flowchart for figuring out artifacts (in the first edition) was beautiful, right down to the skull icon: "You look into the hollow tube and pull the small bit of metal projecting from the opposite end..."<br/><br/>I have to say Chill, since I was actually able to freak out my middle school friends with that one. Also Aftermath. We spent fun-filled hours ('cause that's how long it took) making characters for that game, studying Gun Digest, angling for mutations. Of course, then there was the session where, after all that creation, we were attacked by a pack of wild dogs and had our throats torn out within the first half hour of play...<br/><br/>I also loved Warhammer Fantasy; at the time it seemed like the answer to my dreams. I'm pretty sure at some point I believed I'd never play anything else...<br/><br/>Aaron                        </div>
