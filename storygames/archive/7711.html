Such a singular focus on characters as a system-related element is detrimental to our understanding of the abilities and the potential of the character.<br/><br/>By focusing on the character as a setting element I believe a lot of players will fare much better.

I have seen that in games where the players shift characters a lot their perception of the fiction suffer. It no longer comes alive as readily as before.<br/><br/>I believe we not only identify with our characters in the game. We identify with <i>the setting</i> through our characters.

If by Setting you mean a whole bunch of preplanned world elements like the way Forgotten Realms is laid or 7th Sea's Theah when you include ALL the source books, then I'm not sure what to say about that.  I've never been drawn to all that pre-play detail and now that I know different ways to approach setting I don't really see a reason to go that route.<br/><br/>I much prefer thinking of Setting the way Sorcerer &amp; Sword presents it.  Basically Setting starts as a collection of thematic aesthetics.  From there a cycle happens.  Characters are built from those aesthetics and then as needed the concrete details of the setting are constructed story-by-story to serve the story needs of those characters (i.e Character + Setting = Situation).  As the Situation at hand resolves then that updates the Character which in turn informs the next bit of Setting detail.  And the cycle continues.  In the end you might very well end up with something that resembles The Forgotten Realms or Theah but highly specific to the exploits and thematic needs of the characters.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski" title="NickNovitski"><img alt="NickNovitski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/192/nO35O3RI2BE32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski">NickNovitski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171350/#Comment_171350" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T17:04:50+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  5:04PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sadbunnydrama</cite>The characters are the setting.

To possess, as it were.<br/><br/>If you have a say in the creation of the character, then by creating the character you're saying, "Whatever the nature of the setting, it has this character."<br/><br/>Furthermore if you get to create (or at least relate your character to) family members, allies, enemies, etc., then you are creating some of the setting--again, at very least, by specifying relationships that wouldn't exist otherwise.\n<blockquote>If the character belongs to a guild, the player has (or should have) at least some say on what the guild is like.</blockquote>\nThere's no should. Minimally, if we're not doing random chargen, the player who makes a guild member says, "The guild has <i>this</i> member."

From a rough outline based on an earlier shared brainstorm, Players then created relationships with NPC's and each other.  In so doing they adjusted the setting.  By deciding what to focus on and because this must be "plausible" the setting has more old-regime partisans, more dwarves, more interesting goblins and probably more sexy fey then it did before.<br/><br/>On character + setting = situation, I see that as a fomula that can be solved for any missing element.  If you have characters and situation, you need a certain sort of setting.  If you have setting and situation you need a certain sort of character etc. etc.  The key to me is not "what + what" but "they must all balance and solve in the equation".<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171364/#Comment_171364" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T19:38:05+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  7:38PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite><br/>Ah, but situation is the _intersection_ of setting and character.

Is an authoritarian government an unusually omnipresent Character or an unusually personified Setting? Why should it matter? Trying to split things up only encourages us to think in a reductionist way about characters and settings, when for me no character can truly be separated from their situation, and no setting either. Too much information is encoded in how elements relate to one another to make thinking of them separately a worthwhile endeavour.<br/><br/>Your mileage may vary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

False assumptions makes us take stupid choices. A lot players I know makes stupid choices, not due to them being without the potential for good choices, but due to them being "educated" in a culture permeated with false assumptions. Another false assumption is this: <i>A game is for fun!</i><br/><br/>I'm thinking of it in relation to my experiences with real game-play and players, not a model.
