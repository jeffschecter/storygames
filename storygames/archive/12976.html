It wants to please you! But it's also codependent. It needs to please you, and if it can't or if it misinterprets your desires, things go wrong. So in the game I am constantly asking these probing, occasionally obsequious questions and then misinterpreting the answers.<br/><br/>The maelstrom is a front in my game. There's a population of ...people, constructs, whatever that live in it and are terribly needy and lonely. There is also a countdown leading up to a local merging of the maelstrom and reality. Third front is the hocus' own cult, which is addicted to the maelstrom.<br/><br/>Visually we started by describing great billowing violet clouds, lightning storms, ooga booga. As the countdown runs down, it's just starting to look like normal reality. Albeit populated by dead relatives, long lost lovers, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292469/#Comment_292469" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T06:56:50+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  6:56AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a current player, one thing I focused on was <i>how does my player open his brain?</i>  I felt like that would be a very central experience and be part of the core flavor of the character.

The savvyhead saw a lot of platonic solids.  One of them spoken to him in the voice of his dead adoptive father and gave him advice (he rolled a 10+) on the things he was having trouble with.<br/><br/>When the gunlugger opened her brain (and missed, big time) she saw, and talked to, the gang leader who'd enslaved her as a child, looking as he was after she brutally murdered him to escape.  She also collapsed on the ground, in a seizure.<br/><br/>The driver tried opening his brain once too, and also blew it pretty big, again resulting in a seizure.  He did it while surrounded, in the real world, by a horde of mutant, psychic rats.  So that had an effect.<br/><br/>Damn, it's been 3 weeks since we last played... I can't right now recall whether it was the driver, in the above situation, or the savvyhead in another situation, who opened his brain and talked to the first girl he lost his virginity to, but she was the first human to appear in the maelstrom that may not be dead (we don't know where she is.)  At first I wrote in her notes that she was dead (because I was thinking the maelstrom might be filled with dead people) but I crossed that out.  I want to leave it open.  I think it's also possible the "people" they've been talking to in the maelstrom are really just aspects of their own personality and subconscious mind.  At any rate, every character's experience of it has been very different and personal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292484/#Comment_292484" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T07:59:09+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  7:59AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our maelstrom differs from person to person, so much and so clearly that when two people go there together it's a clash of will whose vision will be dominant. These are the times brains have been opened in our campaign so far:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen our hardholder Daimyo opened his brain first, there was a barren landscape of broken asphalt with a huge tower in it, with the maelstrom swirling around the tower. I think it was mostly gray, blue and purple, we thought of it as a storm more than a maelstrom. Since he failed his first (and only) roll, he encountered a weird-fuck meld of the Land eater, which is a huge (and I mean huge) mechanical excavator near the hardhold; and a hyena, symbolising the hyena cult among his men who tried to draw him in. He failed his roll against the hyena (I think it was cool to take control of it) and it instead took control of him. The MC told the player to do something he'd really regret, and he responded with having Daimyo rape the cult leader.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe battlebabe's maelstrom was similar to the hardholder's, but with the main point being a feeling of vertigo despite appearing to stand on the ground next to the tower. I don't what that time was about, I think she just got some answers and nothing bad happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my operator Nero opened his brain, it was in the sacred chambers of a water cult, and it seemed like the big pool they had started to swirl while the rest of the world pretty much disappeared. The maelstrom was seen more from above and here, too, was the feeling of vertigo, that the maelstrom wanted to draw you in. I failed the roll, and it resulted in Nero being haunted by nightmare of a decrepit woman with burning eyes coming at him until he confronted her (the cult leader below).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the wacknut cult leader npc intruded into the battlebabe Canaveral's brain, they went into her maelstrom, which was falling freely in the middle of the chaos. The battlebabe eventually tried getting out by pulling the cultist with her to her maelstrom. She got her there and psyched her out a little, but in the end she was pulled back.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the operator found the kidnapped Canaveral, who was then possessed by the cult leader, she managed to tell him and he immidiately opened his brain to confront her there. That time we didn't mind much what the maelstrom was like, since Nero went straight for the hocus to claw her off. He succeeded, and it essentially pulled her back to her lame body nearby, but he fell unconscious in the process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292527/#Comment_292527" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T09:33:04+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  9:33AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our Maelstrom is not very well-defined yet; it mostly manifests as sounds, especially old recordings of music.  Only one character has chosen to access it, the Hocus.  He keeps hitting his rolls, so there's been little blowback.  So far he:<br/><br/>1) Used augury during his art scene's revel to pull out a piece of "real" old-time music, a plaintive piece for strings, and 'play' it for everyone.  It was nowhere near orgiastic enough for the crowd, and mutated into a much harsher blast of sound.<br/><br/>2) Opened his brain to try and find a sniper.  It's the only time he's gotten anything visual, an aerial view of the past few minutes run backwards.<br/><br/>3) Opened his brain with his "acolyte", taking her with him into the Maelstrom.  He heard her mother's voice singing a lullaby, which prompted her to confess how bad certain things had gotten at home.<br/><br/>4) Used augury again, to take a Skinner's drum performance during a revel and insert it into the Maelstrom, globally.  I think I just decided that the Skinner has no memory of his performance now, but everyone else keeps dreaming about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack" title="Jon Slack"><img alt="Jon Slack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/512/nUS4FIM85ZXII.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack">Jon Slack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292538/#Comment_292538" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T09:48:27+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  9:48AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2010 9:49AM by Jon Slack.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Maelstrom in my Gamma Road game is always filled with Symbols, and it lets us get a little deeper into the mind spaces of the Player characters. Therefore each person's perception is different, and based on a particular deep seated mental theme. <br/><br/>For JC, our resident Operator, in the Maelstrom he's always a little boy, looking up to his father for advice, talking to him about current problems while reliving events from the past. Sometimes the Dad gives him an important clue, sometimes (when there's a failure) he brings pain and misery.  <br/><br/>For Goldie, our transgendered Chopper, the Maelstrom always has Goldie's deeply buried longings for motherhood.  Either it's a good place, where Goldie interacts with her (idealized) children and gains important insights on the world, or a bad place, where Goldie is tortured by stillborn monsters and the blood of all the sons and daughters she's killed in the wastes.<br/><br/>For Lemieux, the Savvyhead and more recently turned Battlebabe, the Maelstrom was the dead, specifically the people he killed, or the people he didn't save from death.  That really started coming about after he used the Maelstrom to help him figure out how to boost a CB radio's range, and as a result (or a 7-9) accidentally created "Channel 41", which if you turn to, will allow you to hear the dead speak.<br/><br/>A lot of this is deeply personal, and I view it as explicit permission to focus on dream sequences, strange time, and really gonzo crazy imagery. I like using it to contrast how gritty and real the world is, by showing the Maelstrom as a place of dreams and nightmares, and the deepest part of the character's psyche. By asking the players questions, they get to craft the Maelstrom and get into what their characters are all about.  <br/><br/>I also like our interpretation because the Maelstrom is an excuse to see the softer side of the characters.  The world is so harsh and unforgiving that you don't see a lot of tenderness or self-reflection in the wastes, the Maelstrom makes it ok to deal with this stuff, as it's in a place that is not quite real.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292541/#Comment_292541" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T09:55:31+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  9:55AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The sun is sick. It never moves in the sky and long fiery tentacles claw at the horizon. When we open our brain a small black sun can be seen behind the yellow sun, controlling it with black tendrills. It hates humanity and is dead set on eradicating it and even enslaving humans to do its will. We have a custom move which is staring into the sun without opening your brain and it gives insight into a weakness in humanity and a bonus to corresponding stat. A miss gives a penalty to cool until the character gains some insight into the human condition.<br/><br/>My brainer Sundown used a strange cabled antenna in Icks Coil (a tower held together by psychic energy from Ick) to shoot his soul through the fiery sun and severing one of the black tendrils of the black sun to save a newborn child from corruption.<br/><br/>The gunner Buddy has a combat suit that seems to interface with the psychic mealstrom, when he opens his brain the world looks like Tron/The Matrix. Also it's dark, a very positive thing in a world without night!<br/><br/>The driver Marlon Jag sees the road of his live.

Moreover, it's kind of a spiritual tar pit so it's got the animistic spirits of roads and cities and wars in there, along with animal spirits and the broken-down old gods and the dead.  Common theme is that it's broken and everything hungers for people's love and blood and attention. <br/><br/>tl;dr: A mashup of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Donnie Darko </span>and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dictionary of Mu</span>, plus some leftovers from Werewolf: the Apocalypse.  But it's really varied from person to person.<br/><br/>EDIT: I'd like to make the maelstrom more interactive.

The Maelstrom was dying and we had to fix it.  Additionally, the reavers, who had left the original Maelstrom network, had their own network based on cruelty and meat and one character at least was determined that fixing the Maelstrom involved plugging the reavers back into it.  There was also some other stuff going on, like how the Maelstrom interacted with the Light, which was this supernatural force that made you feel peaceful and happy, but kinda brainwashed you too.<br/><br/>In our current game, the Maelstrom is the ghost of the glorious past before the apocalypse, which you can actually open up windows to.

No matter what, opening your mind to it feels nice, like a thousand tiny hugs from half-completed strangers. It's where the good goes when a person dies.<br/><br/>It's curious about you. It asks you questions in order to figure out how you'll fit into it, when you die. It asks you questions in order to anticipate you better. Because it loves you, and wants you comfortable when you come home for keeps.<br/><br/>It is recklessly and hopelessly positive. It is incapable of seeing problems, and so asking it to help you learn more about a vicious bike gang will go strangely... It'll do its best to help, it'll show you all of their virtues and their best moments, it'll barf forth optimistica. That's it.</i><br/><br/>And then the rest of the world will be the apocalypse world. People getting sick off the bamboo shoots they failed to boil correctly, thugs who mount crude spikes onto their human-hide jackets, angels in it for the barter and nothing more.
