I'd promised Elizabeth that we could play it, so I hacked together something that's halfway between <i>Apocalypse World</i> and <i>World of Dungeons</i> in terms of complexity. As with my previous AW-derived hacks (Planarch Codex, The Afterborn), the core moves -- and everything else -- definitely need some serious work after the first playtest, but enough worked to prove that the project is starting to come together.<br/><br/>There are about 3 killer apps right now, with the rest needing reworking (<a href="http://corvidsun.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/firmament_090212.pdf" rel="nofollow">here's the draft we used</a>).<br/><br/>The first killer app is <b>group travel</b>. <i>Firmament</i> is a fantasy game about people living in deep space without spaceships or spacesuits, traveling by reaching out and grabbing the stars, pulling themselves towards them. This is pretty dangerous to do solo because, if you blow your travel roll, you end up lost by yourself and have to hope you find someone or someone finds you. Given that space is massive, the odds aren't in your favor.<br/><br/>In group travel, each player first places their "hold." Players have either 1 or 2 hold, based on having two hands. You place your hold by putting your hand flat against the table in the direction of another player, simulating grabbing onto them. Having a tightly bound group is better, but at least one player needs a free hand to roll the dice for traveling (roll+wayfinding). Plus, if you have extra hands free, a different player can roll to attempt to recover if the first player blows their roll or if the group breaks apart in transit.<br/><br/>Breaking apart happens because, once the first wayfinder has made or failed their roll, the GM rolls+0 to test each hold. On a 10+, you hold fast. On a 7-9, you drop a few fingers. On a 6-, the hold breaks. This part is unbelievably compelling and stressful, since it is inevitably fraught and the consequences are potentially massive, but placing your holds semi-strategically dramatically increases the chances of having everyone arrive safely.<br/><br/>The first time we rolled group travel, Elizabeth and James made it safely, based on Elizabeth's roll, but the group split, with Dev hanging onto Jackson by just a few fingers. Then Jackson nailed his recovery roll (since he had left a hand free) and we all sighed with relief. We were about to move on, when I remembered: "Oh, we forgot to test Dev's hold on the recovery." Sure enough, I rolled a 7-9 result and Dev had to drop his last few fingers, spinning away into the darkness. Luckily, they were on a well-known and well-marked route, so Dev rejoined the group quickly, but it was an excellent taste of the danger present in the game.<br/><br/>The last thing we did in the playtest, right after Elizabeth had to go catch a flight, was have the group try to carry an enormous hunk of raw crystal (previously used as a beacon) back to their "home" star. I totally hadn't considered something like this, but Dev immediately was like: "Clearly we have to leave a few hands to hang onto the crystal as we carry it." Crap! Sure enough, losing Elizabeth and having to spend extra hold on the crystal placed serious strain on the group, in addition to them trying to jump straight back to known territory (blazing a new route) rather than working their way back star-by-star. We closed with Dev spinning off into the darkness again, this time with no real idea where he was, but clutching the crystal. Had we continued, the next part of the session would have involved playing out the "recovery protocols" in order to find him and his treasure again, before they were lost forever.<br/><br/>The two other killer apps, <b>carrying the fire</b> (terminology stolen from Cormac McCarthy) and <b>sharing things with stars</b> (and other players, as a form of "Hx" at the beginning) were also great, but more uneven and need some revision. All in all, though, pretty exciting and something I hope to work on and play again soon.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389113/#Comment_389113" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-03T12:52:56+00:00" title="September  3, 2012 12:52PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More PAX: I ran my Mouse Guard mission, <i>The Siege of Sprucetuck</i>, five times this weekend at Games on Demand. <br/><br/>All I can say is that the Player Turn is a powerful mutagen!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389125/#Comment_389125" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-03T15:14:04+00:00" title="September  3, 2012  3:14PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got to play <i>Witch: The Road to Lindesfarne</i> at Dragon Con and it was very cool.

We had two farmers in adjacent fjords, with a blood feud between them, both NPCs, with the PCs orbiting around one of them. The Child went exploring on some foreign ships that had landed in the other fjord and to save him from discovery the Huscarl distracted and insulted the returning owners, while the Skjaldmey took the kid to safety. Hakon, the landowner comes over some time later, with his foreign guests (one of them a cousin of the King), demanding retribution for yet another insult added to the list. The Wanderer reveals himself a spokesperson for Odin and the foreigners are christians (obviously). There's a fight, the foreigners are defeated and the Huscarl lets the Child slit the throat of the king's relative, both making the kid into a man and ensuring the king's vengance...<br/><br/>demo #2: I stole the outcome of the first game as setup for the second which is why it probably kicked off a bit sooner. This time we have a Settler a few fjords to the south, with a wife who is not bearing him children and a Cailin lover on the side. The Go\xf0i has great things in store for the simple farmer and (being a worshiper of Freya) seeks a way to ensure his progeny. What follows is an endearing familial drama between the two women, both looking for their place in this situation, ending with an polyamorous marriage and two children with a blessing from Freya. On the fringes of this there is a Sei\xf0kona (the Cailin's sister) acting as a go between and provider of herbs (used to both prevent and ensure pregnancies at various junctions) and a Huscarl serving a rich man up north who also desires the Cailin. The news of the killing of the king's cousin reach the valley, applying pressure on the modest Settler to declare his place in the incoming conflict and strike sparks between the two men, one an old gendered warrior the other a peaceful youth. There's also the rich man's son, Floki, a coward seeking to betray them and swear allegiance to the king and his murder of the child from the first game who comes bearing the news of what happened to the north. We wrap up in winter, with the birth of two children and an uncertain future.<br/><br/><b>Beyond the Mirror</b>: This is basically <i>Do androids dream of electric sheep?</i> the game by Tazio Bettin.  The setup, with some input by the players provides a pretty desperate situation in a very limited physical space (we played on a moving train). You start with a vague memory of something (it has to be the player's memory, which is a beautiful touch) and then by striving to get your goal in the story your memory gets either scarred/blurred or focused. Typically getting your goal means you end up an android, making your achievement rather meaningless. I was playing Anne Esterhazy the assistant of a powerful man, a hard working, ambitious woman, who has made the first and fatal mistake of her carreer, by losing an important briefcase. The train is now crawling with agents trying to find the incriminating documents within, I'm trying to get the briefcase back, a journalist is trying to get me (and/or the briefcase) for a big Pulitzer scoop and the thief is skulking about. I had to leave the game early but I hear it ended all in suicides.<br/><br/><b>Murderous Ghosts: </b> I ran a quick game in-between slots for Tazio. I think I'm slowly getting the hang of this game. He said he was really creeped out even if all that happened was a child crawling around a loft and looking down through holes in the floor. I think we played for less than 20 minutes because the ghost ended up murdering the explorer after an unlucky card draw.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389144/#Comment_389144" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-03T23:39:54+00:00" title="September  3, 2012 11:39PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>That's pretty awesome.</blockquote>\nI agree, I am. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389155/#Comment_389155" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T06:47:13+00:00" title="September  4, 2012  6:47AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Due to an attendance drop for our regular Apocalypse World game, three of us gave Remember Tomorrow a spin. <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/106312142172114622735/posts/C7ofN3sXtQD" rel="nofollow">Joe wrote it up more over on Google+</a>, but from his notes:<br/><br/>We set it in Detroit, during a senatorial campaign.

I was the Grey Wizard, the head of the Council -- the game's GM. The others played a Summoner, a Druid, and a Necromancer.<br/><br/>Our four realms were under siege by the undead. Furthermore, a Faerie Prince had led an army of elvish warriors to besiege the Summoner's citadel. The Druid had lost control of the ambulatory carnivorous plants in his garden, and they were laying siege to the people of his kingdom, and the Necromancer's apprentice had taken to the infernal lands by a demon.<br/><br/>The four of us were in full-blown crisis mode from the moment play began, and as we worked to help each other, cracks began to appear in the foundation. The Necromancer tried -- and failed -- to halt the spread of the undead plague in the Druid's realm, and shortly thereafter, the Druid discovered that the Necromancer was a traitor to his own order: he'd murdered the former High Necromancer and taken his place. Distrust and accusation ensued.<br/><br/>I was able to deploy an Obsidian Golem from the Anvil Mountains to find and kill two halflings that sought to defeat the Summoner with some magical ring -- I sent him their heads as a gesture of peace after it was revealed that I had betrayed the Council five years earlier, during the Red Harvest. It wasn't enough for the Necromancer, who accused me of a blatant power grab, or the Druid, who cursed me for not having the leadership skill needed to guide the Council through this time of conflict. The Summoner alone was pleased, because I was able to save him, ensuring that at the end of the game, he alone would survive.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the Necromancer tried to steel himself (and his gore-encrusted apprentice, recently rescued from the torments of the Abyss) for battle against the ever-hungry undead, but they were both devoured. The Druid's realm, once green and fertile, was laid to waste by the demons that the Summoner had sent (in vain) to defend against the Faerie Prince's legions. Bitter and alone, the Druid damned us all before his crystal ball went dark. I blamed the other three for their incompetence as the ghouls swarmed my chamber and tore me apart. The Summoner stared into his orb, puzzled. "Brothers? ... Are you there? ... No? ... Then it appears there is a new Grey Wizard," he said, chuckling.<br/><br/>We stayed in character the whole time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389498/#Comment_389498" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-07T06:11:37+00:00" title="September  7, 2012  6:11AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Panty Explosion Perfect.<br/><br/>One of the girls has a goal of "Chasing those hooligans out of my fathers store."  She has a scene with the boys where she discovers the boys already causing trouble, harassing and old woman, drinking beer and destroying magazines that they haven't paid for.  She gets the upper hand, but then the Demon comes out from the bathroom and surveys the situation.  He is pale, but styled.  He has ladder shades, and a long leather coat with a popped collar.  His very presence emboldens the hooligans, and he hypnotizes the girl into <i>paying him</i> for the damages instead.<br/><br/>The candidate for class presidency is giving a great, rousing speach, but her rival (the least popular girl in school) stands up to support her and therefore screw her over).  Our candidate commands her loyal army of ninja schoolgirls (army is a bit on an exageration... there were only four of them, but still) to rapel down from the ceiling and abduct the girl.  In an instant she is secreted into the rafters and unable to harm the candidate's race.<br/><br/>The demon sees this (as he followed one of the girls back to school) and snaps his fingers.  Suddenly the ninja schoolgirls all have ladder shades and popped collars.

But it was totally cool.  She decided to cast a spell, and to keep it hidden (so she could nab some Exp).  I set the difficulty pretty high, but she made it work and it was cool.<br/><br/>Fast forward a bit, the crew is out of their cages, near the bottom of the Hand of Sorrow.  Cyrus and the Lady are trying to shout down the prison guards.  The alarm hasn't been tripped, but the guards are still the only ones with actual weapons at the moment.  Cyrus blows his roll, and the guards recognize him.  They begin to gloat about how much they'll enjoy "re-capturing" Cyrus, and how much Cyrus will be rewarded for "coming back to the empire" with these new informants to torture, gesturing to the rest of teh crew.<br/><br/>The Lady decides it's no time to pretend.  She intends to channel the storm, which is literally 40 feet below them, through the floor to disable the guards.  She gathers plenty of dice, and since she's not trying to hide anything, I set the difficulty at 3.  She rolls 2 successes on 8 dice.<br/><br/>The Blue swirls at her call, and her blood cools to be at one with it, hair waving like whisps and motes of electric dust around her arms as she gestures.  A small bolt leaps from her fingers, and synchronized, a large blast moves from the storm below.  But instead of going up into the guards, it fires downward...<br/><br/>The Lady herself might not know, but the terrified guards know.  The sound that followed was that of a wounded Sky Squid.<br/><br/>I tell the Lady to mark "Hunted.  The Squid totally knows it was you that did it."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389501/#Comment_389501" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-07T06:23:36+00:00" title="September  7, 2012  6:23AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not exactly bite-sized, but hey, it's a <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17167/fiasco-los-angeles-1936-a-p-from-dragoncon-2012#Item_2" rel="nofollow">Fiasco.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389514/#Comment_389514" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-07T08:06:50+00:00" title="September  7, 2012  8:06AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeh, I don't remember seeing any crosses-by-the-numbers, but we were doing it all by ourselves anyway (like, we all intentionally had our characters have something to do with each other from the beginning, and we all used opportunities to relate a Factions action to what we had just seen them do to/with another character)<br/><br/>My understanding of the rules is that Deals HAVE to be with a Faction.

The wand backfired, and the poor bard got to spend the entire battle as a semi-sentient corrosive substance.<br/><br/>My barbarian warlord, highly resistant to puny magic spells, rolled a 1 on his save vs. the death priest's finger of death spell. Sad times were had by all. The system was super-fun, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389837/#Comment_389837" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-11T14:54:30+00:00" title="September 11, 2012  2:54PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played another game of Fiasco.

Dodge stole something from Lily that she doesn't know (she's likely blinded by the tales of Dodge's epic escapes.)  And Galadiir just "knows" that Lily is keeping something secret from him.<br/><br/>Galadiir doesn't trust Lily, and he probably shouldn't.  Dodge knows that Lenore has his back... this and more!<br/><br/>It even bled into our equipment.  One of the Bard options was "a fiddle that has never been played."  So, problem solved.  Lily carries that fiddle everywhere, but she hasn't played it yet.  Soon as she got it, the bow went missing, and her Bardly sense of an Epic tells her that she musn't play the fiddle with a <i>different</i> bow.  Little does she know, it was Dodge what stole it.

The party of 3 has about 10 hirelings of different vocations. They stop before a dark scary alcove where it looks like someone has been trying to conceal a puddle of blood. They contemplate for a while and a wandering monster party of goblins walk in to them. Reaction roll is 11! They talk for a while about the dungeon and the goblin's war against the cult living several levels below and agree to cooperate. But first, search the scary alcove! A ghoul was lurking there listening to their conversation but they slew it on one mighty stab of a spear. The ghoul is decked out in a couple of thousand gps worth of loot and now a much more tense and hostile discussion erupts about how to divide the loot. The party can easily overtake the goblin party but they don't want to lose the alliance.

The  ship's A.I (Mother) had gone antipathic and tried to kill us with some xenopathogen. Then when that didn't work, it took the NavSys offline and crashed us into space debris. Our rescue beacon was picked up by the Yukaghir (hostile aliens), who deployed hunter-killers to our location.<br/><br/>The four of us (Bridge, Medical, Weapons, and Engineering) tried to work together to resolve our issues. Medical's rebreathers were offline, and he was in danger of suffocation. Engineering couldn't get anything done until the Bridge (that would be me) activated the ENG-225 switch, which I didn't want to do, because there was quantum interference all over the command deck, which had turned the Captain and First Officer inside out, so I refused to go out there, and spent the whole game clutching a remote terminal from inside an escape pod, too chicken to leave without the others. The Weapons Officer was freaking out because her entire crew was infected with the xenopathogen -- lesions, emissions, that sort of thing. Just a bad situation overall.<br/><br/>One by one, we managed to get these issues resolved, but along the way, Engineering (who was acting in an increasingly suspicious manner) discovered that Medical had piggybacked a subspace signal along the distress beacon, alerting the murderous Yukaghir to our location. Not long after that, Medical discovered that Engineering had reactivated Mother after we shut the A.I. down. In fact, Engineering duped me (the Bridge) into doing his dirty work for him, because he convinced me to activate the ENG-225 switch remotely -- which brought Mother back online and allowed her to lower our hull shields. Which meant that the ship was about to implode.<br/><br/>Despite one crew member going insane and falling in love with Mother (that would be Engineering) and another betraying us to violent xenomorphs (Medical, who tried to justify it by citing the aliens' advanced technology), three of us were able to survive the scenario, making our way aboard escape pods and blasting ourselves into space.<br/><br/>No one knows what happened to Engineering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391173/#Comment_391173" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-23T19:13:50+00:00" title="September 23, 2012  7:13PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Yukaghir technology had the capability to cure all human illness!

We spent the day playing the new "Spartacus" board game, inspired and licenced from the TV series of the same name. <br/><br/>I would say that I'm impressed with it but that would be a severe understatement. If you dig games that are both tactical and social (like the trading aspect of Settlers of Cataan) then Spartacus is a perfect hybrid of the two. You will need to co-operate with your fellow players to pull of schemes that are too complex for one player to do on their own and then you need to out-maneuver them in the gladitorial arena. If you can only accomplish one or the other you will suffer for it.<br/><br/>Most importantly, every aspect of the game is fun. It's not a tactical game with a social bit tacked on nor is it a social game with the tactical bit added after the fact. The game seamlessly combines both aspects and keeps every moment tense. Just when you think you have things sewn up and the win in the bag, your opponent plays a dirty scheme or makes a surprising move in the arena you can find yourself on the bottom of the heap again real fast.<br/><br/>Get it, play it, keep it in your collection.<br/>=======-------=======<br/><br/>We played two games: There are three "modes": Short, Medium and Long. To help the others understand the game, we played the Short version which lasted exactly two rounds (and about one hour). We ate lunch, came back and played a Long game, which took us about 4 hours but was SO SATISFYING. People rose and fell in favor until finally the House of Batiatus crushed us all.<br/><br/>If you like games with social aspects, it's got it in spades. Everything you do can be traded/bought/sold. If you liked the TV show, you'll love this game: The board centerpiece is the "gladiator arena", but the fighting--like in the show--is nothing more than a vehicle for social maneuvering. It's not a game about gladiator fighting, it's a game about social maneuvering, where gladiator fighting is a big vehicle for it.<br/><br/>We were playing with my friend Travis' copy, who got it at GenCon: I already pre-ordered mine and can't wait for the official release day.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391205/#Comment_391205" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-24T09:28:57+00:00" title="September 24, 2012  9:28AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Monsterhearts last night. <br/><br/>After he killed a cop, our Ghoul got a new body and doesn't remember his werewolf girlfriend, in fact he has a new one we've never met.

Soon after, crew members began to display heightened aggression and acute anxiety. The ship somehow crashed into the station, resulting in severe damage.

Medical was able to restore his vision, but amid all the chaos, Engineering discovered the truth -- that Medical had been conducting secret experiments aboard the ship, experiments somehow related to the tentacled horrors approaching our vessel.<br/><br/>After Medical's secret was discovered, no one wanted to help him, but it was a moot point: he was safe, and headed for the airlocks. Engineering also managed to escape. <br/><br/>Weapons, on the other hand, was still in grave danger, but seemed oblivious to it. He'd been muttering about hearing "them," nameless entities scratching at the walls. At first, we didn't take him seriously. Then they tore through the walls and revealed themselves. Weapons declined an offer to follow the others to an airlock. He grinned maniacally and said he was going to go with "them."<br/><br/>Bridge whispered, "They're here. It's not what you think." Then he went dark.\ufeff                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391539/#Comment_391539" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-27T05:48:18+00:00" title="September 27, 2012  5:48AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dungeon World.<br/><br/>Trekking through the sewers tunnels, based on rumors of gargoyles (and where there's gargoyles there's treasure).  The four of us had picked up a villager who was wandering the streets after his house burned down.  We sent him in first.<br/><br/>The villager was the first to encounter the tentacles, emaciated, trapped here since some long forgotten flood.  The thief and the bard dispatched it from afar, mostly, but the cleric slipped trying to come to the thief's defense, and revealed (and then shattered) a nest of gargoyle eggs.<br/><br/>Our poor, heroic villager waved that torch, trying to ward off the swarming, angry gargoyles, but was grievously wounded.  When the bard went to heal the villager, the recently forgotten tentacles latched onto the noise and strangled the song out of her, sickening her also with it's filth and decay.<br/><br/>Ancient otherworldly treasure was discovered, and the sewers revealed still more secrets...<br/><br/>For our first game, it was a lot of fun.  It's a gear change to get used to the pacing, the tit-for-tat, the rhythm of the thing, but it's fun.  Next session, maps!  And perhaps our villager will discover a hero inside him?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391587/#Comment_391587" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-27T14:15:05+00:00" title="September 27, 2012  2:15PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dang, I want to play ViewScream again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Bite-Size Actual Play: September 2012 - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17149/bite-size-actual-play-september-2012/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Bite-Size Actual Play: September 2012 - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17149/bite-size-actual-play-september-2012/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Monsterhearts: me playing the Werewolf, Sam playing the Witch, Nathanael playing the Queen, Annie playing the Mortal.

Noah MCing.<br/><br/>Mortal Celest rushed on Queen Vladimir, exchange student and mysterious organizer of a local Larp ("Will be best weekend of your life!"), while angry, abused Werewolf Mason awkwardly admired Witch Caroline. Everyone got invited to the weekend Larp event, where Vlad and Celest exchanged true feelings, and nipped off to a cabin to consumate.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Vlad's right hand douchebag Tad picked a fight with Mason, who was only too happy to oblige, beating him up and going full wolf in front of everyone. Caroline has hexed Tad and become her Darkest Self, and now felt slighted by Mason: he brought him here to avoid a fight, and here he was fighting! (not to mention transforming into a terrifying wolf creature. She hexed him, he mauled her, realized what he had done and came back to himself... lying on top of her, clothes shredded.<br/><br/>Vlad's Darkest Self was triggered by sex with the Mortal, and he realized through his psychic link that Tad had fucked up. He ordered his other flunkies to dispose of him, and turned his attentions back to Celest. He tied her wrists to the bed with his belt, and said it was "time to get serious." (Celest marked experience from <i>Excuses are my Armor</i>!) Having sex made her a member of his clique, which meant is Darkest Self held her responsible too! He pulled out a knife, raised it over her terrified head... and cu her bonds, knelt before her, and handed her the knife--escaping his Darkest Self by giving some of his power to someone more deserving.<br/><br/>Mason broke free of his Darkest Self, having wounded who he cared about most. And Caroline broke free of hers when she forgave who had hurt her the most.
