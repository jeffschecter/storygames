Possibly my most hilarious <i>Fiasco</i> game, ever, used a <i>Medici</i> playset (i.e. early Italian Renaissance in Florence). We ended up doing vulgar comedy in the manner of Boccaccio mixed with religious-political conspiracy, held together by a very straightforward heist. I have no idea whether that playset has been translated to English.<br/><br/>Of course, hilarity isn't the only measure of a good <i>Fiasco</i> game - you can have darker sessions as well, intense and moving.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462565/#Comment_462565" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T08:29:45+00:00" title="April 28, 2017  8:29AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd suggest that Game of Thrones, aside from a few moments of High Fantasy, is very concerned with the 'slice of life,' albeit a slice of medieval fantasy-kingdom life.

We play a lot of Fiasco and I just wanted to make sure we were doing something that was different.  We've played The Ice and had success (although I agree, I don't think it's the best playset out there), we've played Game of Thrones and had success (which was amazingly dark and serious); in fact, we've played a lot of Fiasco and <b>never</b> had a bad session. <br/><br/>We ended up playing The Touring Rockband. It was an incredibly funny and witty session. It was comedy gold. The people I play with are  super talented, it amazes me :-) Anyway, I will do a write up of the session if and when I have time.
