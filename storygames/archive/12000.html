I deceived my players during my 2 year campaign.  Constantly.  I talked to Lenny Balsera about it and he really didn't like what I was doing, so after the end of the campaign, I told my players what I had done and they told me the couldn't tell the whole time.  Then, when I teamed up with one of the players to tag-team a campaign that ran for another 1.5 years, we did it again.  And the players never knew.  And they loved it.<br/><br/>Suppose you are DMing a D&amp;D 4e game and you want to spend time making some really cool things with a lot of detail.  You know, like props that you can hand to the players, like long-ish documents, browned with age, NPCs with rich backgrounds that they discover,  secret rooms containing important stuff -- that sort of thing.  You don't want to make whether the players encounter these things based on skill rolls; you want to guarantee that they find these things.<br/><br/>But D&amp;D and the like have skills for discovering things.  Even FATE does.  Should players just never take these skills?  What does it <b>mean</b> when you make a Perception roll to search a desk?  Does it mean you are guaranteed only to find things that aren't important to the story?<br/><br/>Do you just hang it up and throw out D&amp;D, saying it just doesn't work and switch to a game that has specific mechanics to handle this?  I don't -- especially if my players <b>want</b> to play D&amp;D.  I talked about some story telling techniques I use in <a href="http://this-statement-is-false.blogspot.com/2010/01/story-telling-in-role-playing-games.html" rel="nofollow">this post</a> on my blog before Lenny Balsera turned me on to Story Games.<br/><br/>I cover a few techniques I used, which I tried to give pithy names to (FAIL?): "Ball and Cups," "Well, Aren't You Clever?" and "Reality Is How You Perceive It".<br/><br/>Ball and Cups: when the players are searching for something, keep "moving it" until they succeed.  You might let them find it in the Nth place they look, so they feel like they've done some work<br/><br/>Well, Aren't You Clever: throw "soft balls" at the group, calling for Perception rolls and "punishing" bad ones with minor inconveniences.  When they make a really good one, reveal the <b>important thing</b> they were supposed to perceive<br/><br/>Reality Is How You Perceive It: when the players want to search for something that isn't there and the succeed, make something up and give it to them, Donjon-style<br/><br/><br/>Here's my motivation for these things.  When a PC majors in information-gathering skills, it means that the player wants the spotlight on their clever character.  These are just ways to use some story telling techniques to highlight what that PC is good at and give them a little glory.<br/><br/>I know this is controversial.  Some people really hate it!<br/><br/>I want to hear why you hate it!<br/><br/>If you do this, tell me how you do it!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268457/#Comment_268457" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T01:32:18+00:00" title="April 23, 2010  1:32AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wburdick</cite>I want to hear why you hate it!</blockquote>\nI hate it, because you're asking players to dance for your pleasure.<br/><br/>Do you have important information for them?

Does it mean you are guaranteed only to find things that aren't important to the story?"<br/><br/>From what you're writing, it sounds like either: A) "Yes, perception rolls are never really important to the story," or <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> "No, I'm making things up as I go along to fit their results, maybe like in Donjon."<br/><br/>B is essentially doing exactly what I do.<br/><br/>Dancing for pleasure:<br/>Actually, it is <b>I</b> who dance for <b>their</b> pleasure -- I do a lot of work for my players.  And after 3.5 years of playing in my games, they still love playing in them.  I have some game logs online if you want to see them. :P<br/><br/>These particular techniques I'm describing are just about perception, but that's not what my games are usually all about.  This is just a way I handle disseminating information.  The difference between what you would do and what I do is that instead of <i>giving it to them</i> and not using any game mechanics at all, I couch it in game mechanics.  I think this is appropriate in a game like D&amp;D, where Streetwise, Diplomacy, Perception, Insight, and Intimidation are skills.<br/><br/>Apparently, if you had an item that was crucial to the story that could conceivably involve one of these skills, you would just blow off the mechanics and use pure narration, probably leaving the players thinking, "Sheesh, I spent time choosing these skills and thinking about how they play into my character's development and I never actually get to play out using those skills.  The DM just tells me what happens..."  I'm essentially just <i>giving it to them</i>, but I ask for skill rolls.  Sometimes, the skill rolls are "legit" and the result really matters.  Sometimes they are "fake."  The players don't know which is which.  There is a "fourth wall" and a "suspension of disbelief" there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268461/#Comment_268461" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T02:17:19+00:00" title="April 23, 2010  2:17AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>No sir, I don't like it.

I don't know what you think I'm doing, but you must think that there's only one way the things I'm talking about can play out and that it's just evil.<br/><br/>So if you want games that actively support your prep, you must be taking the "throw D&amp;D out" tack.  Yeah, it's all about playing a system that supports your prep.  Who cares what system the players want to play.<br/><br/>Just FYI, the first campaign was in Spirit of the Century and the second was in Universalis + PDQ + FATE.  So, uh, the players had a <b>lot</b> of impact on the story, up to changing NPC motivations and totally rerouting the story line.  Railroading?

I don't understand why you're using those techniques deceptively.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaturally if you do background prep, moving those things to where the players can encounter them makes perfect sense. It's not deceptive to do that because until it's in play it doesn't exist. So why waste everyone's time moving the cups around when you can just give them the ball?<br/>\n<br/>\nI find your 'reality is how you perceive it' to be entirely unproblematic and not deceptive. They're interested, so you give them content. What's deceptive about that?<br/>\n<br/>\nChanging the stuff that isn't in play on the fly is in no way deceptive - my problem with what you're doing as you portray it is that you're wasting the player's time with jumping through meaningless hoops to get to the content. 'Make a skill check until you succeed so something interesting can happen' does nothing for the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268465/#Comment_268465" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T02:59:09+00:00" title="April 23, 2010  2:59AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, if you don't mind and the players are enjoying it, do it. I don't see any problem with illusionism if everyone is having a good time, if you prefer illusionism to being open and metagame-y about it. You've a clue or some other cool thing. With this technique, you don't let a die roll or an arbitrary choice prevent them from encountering it. That's not to say that they can't circumvent a problem through clever play. "Making sure players find clues" is not the same as saying "players have no choices." Oh, noes, my free will is gone because my character found a book in a library without rolling" is a peculiar argument.<br><br>Anyway, to avoid illusionism, and yet still handle this in-game rather than at a meta-game level - this is what the GUMSHOE core clue is for. If they have any skill points in the ability, give them the clue. They still get the spotlight, and you get to give them a handout.

It shows that they care about what they're doing and they care about the players.  It's a mark of quality.<br/><br/>I also like players taking part in the entire creative process, which is why I blended Universalis in with my FATE/PDQ mashup (the players loved it and it worked great).  During the PDQ/FATE parts of the sessions, we played like "normal RPGers".  Some of the "investigative" qualities were: Intimidator, Interrogation, Impersonator, Chicago Cab Driver, Explorer, Student of Human Nature, and Historian.  The players had sunk some serious points into some of these.  I wanted to be able to prepare nice goodies and also let their characters shine like the heroes they were.<br/><br/>They changed the story I had laid out a <b>lot</b>, giving me twists I would never have thought of; which is what I wanted them to do, of course.  Like when they had defeated leader of the Exalted Order of Anubis and taken the "Ear of Osiris" artifact.  One of the players framed a scene at EOA, where the leadership discussed whether to let the PCs keep it or chase them down.  They changed the entire 2nd half of the story.  So I inserted a large blank space in my spreadsheet and started patching up the story, taking the Universalis facts into account.<br/><br/>Also, I was wondering about current indie games w.r.t. preparation.

I don't understand why you're using those techniques deceptively.<br><br>Naturally if you do background prep, moving those things to where the players can encounter them makes perfect sense. It's not deceptive to do that because until it's in play it doesn't exist. So why waste everyone's time moving the cups around when you can just give them the ball?<br><br>I find your 'reality is how you perceive it' to be entirely unproblematic and not deceptive. They're interested, so you give them content. What's deceptive about that?<br/><br/>Changing the stuff that isn't in play on the fly is in no way deceptive - my problem with what you're doing as you portray it is that you're wasting the player's time with jumping through meaningless hoops to get to the content. 'Make a skill check until you succeed so something interesting can happen' does nothing for the game.</br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nI agree.  Making a skill check that has no interesting failure at all is annoying.  So "punishing bad rolls with minor inconveniences" doesn't have to be boring.  The point of this technique is to give Aragorn a chance to recount the battle and track the hobbits into Fangorn forest.  In the movie, you see Aragorn having trouble finding clues at first, but he quickly found a piece of rope that led him to the recounting of the struggle.  This technique doesn't work well to highlight a mediocre Perception score.  I would only use it if there was a character with a really high Perception, so there won't be very many failures anyway.  The failures that do happen can discover unpleasant things, like a nest of snakes, for instance.<br/><br/>As for "deception", OK, you caught my hyperbole.  There's not a real antagonism there between me and the players.  It's a collaborative effort.  My idea of "deception" comes from "suspension of disbelief" in the game mechanics themselves in cases like these.  When you watch a tense scene in a movie, you still know that those are actors up on the screen and no one is truly in danger.  Same thing here with game mechanics.  The players know that there's a story behind the session and that their characters are the stars.  When they make rolls to search, they know from past experience with me that they're not just making empty rolls that will lead no where.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268472/#Comment_268472" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T03:27:53+00:00" title="April 23, 2010  3:27AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2010 3:29AM by wburdick.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Aik</cite>I don't think <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is intended as "Why Aren't You Clever" - it's giving them what they wanted and if they failed then it turns out that what they want wasn't very good for them after all - but they still got it.

If you combine a D&amp;D-like ruleset with, for instance, an investigative framework, you have to come up with some "solutions", and what you describe is a set of very common solutions that I would imagine most people who have GMed for any length of time have used.<br/><br/>Now, you're going to get some resistance to this topic at Story Games, because I would guess a very solid proportion of the people drawn to this community are people who have grown frustrated over the years with similar techniques (and I am one of them)--that's why they're here. So, you're preaching to the wrong crowd, in a sense.<br/><br/>The techniques clearly "work", at least when handled right. However, I can tell you why I don't like them: they're less fun than the alternative. For years, I didn't know there was an alternative, but now that I know some different ways to handle the same challenge ("How do I play an investigative game, and how do I prep for it, and how do I make rolls matter, all at the same time?"), I've found the alternatives much, much more fun.<br/><br/>Most of the techniques, like what you call Ball and Cups, come down to a funny sort of illusion that, over the long term, creates predictable patterns in the game. <br/><br/>* The players have fun when they find the clues (or whatever), but the *process* of getting there is frustrating. In the short term, you can overlook that: it was frustrating at first, but now here's the reward! Cool. But in the long term, I see players getting bored and/or frustrated more often that not: for how many years can you play out "look around for the clue, not finding it anywhere... and then, miraculously, there it is!" Do it often enough and it gets old quick.<br/>* The GM has less fun, too, because s/he knows exactly what's going to happen. "Players look for clue" = "They search unsuccessfully for a while, then succeed." As a GM, there's zero suspense or interest there for me. I'd much rather have the players announce actions and then let the dice surprise us all. Because, if I'm doing the Ball and Cups thing, I've already effectively decided how things will turn out, and I'm just playing the game of pretending there's some suspense involved. That means less player input into the story (if any!), and no surprise for me at all. That gets boring and tiresome for the GM, as well, over the long term.<br/><br/>Overall, what it comes down to is that these methods (for me) create that feeling of:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wburdick</cite><br/>Dancing for pleasure:<br/>Actually, it is<b>I</b>who dance for<b>their</b>pleasure -- I do a lot of work for my players.  And after 3.5 years of playing in my games, they still love playing in them.  I have some game logs online if you want to see them. :P<br/></blockquote>\nYou see how he said that the players are dancing for your pleasure? And then you come back saying that, no, you're the one dancing for their pleasure? <br/><br/>In my experience, in such games, more often than not, BOTH parties start to feel like they're dancing for the other's pleasure. And they can still have fun doing that, sure. But I prefer by far a game where no one has to feel that way at all. Because, if you've decided the players are going to get the clue once they look in the fourth room of the castle, everything up until then is "dancing for their pleasure": we all have to pretend that something meaningful and suspenseful is going on, and pretend it's uncertain, and make it seem like fun at the same time. But we're just "dancing", because we already know how it's going to turn out.<br/><br/>That's my experience of the thing, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268496/#Comment_268496" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T06:32:03+00:00" title="April 23, 2010  6:32AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just for completeness, I can answer this, even though it wasn't aimed at me:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wburdick</cite><br/>So what's your answer to my question: "What does it mean when you make a Perception roll to search a desk? Does it mean you are guaranteed only to find things that aren't important to the story?"<br/><br/>From what you're writing, it sounds like either: A) "Yes, perception rolls are never really important to the story," or <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> "No, I'm making things up as I go along to fit their results, maybe like in Donjon."<br/><br/>B is essentially doing exactly what I do.<br/></blockquote>\nI don't think either of those are good, complete solutions. Here's how I look at it:<br/><br/>Rolling the dice isn't interesting. Choices are interesting. Consequences are interesting.<br/><br/>So, from that point of view, there are many different solutions to this issue. For example:<br/><br/>* Make finding the clue an interesting choice, not just a random outcome. Ok, you know the Mayor's got the letter in his desk. Are you willing to break into his house, become a criminal just like those you're fighting, to get it? Make it a choice, a meaningful choice that says something about the characters or puts something on the line. "Are you going to risk getting infected with the curse by going to retrieve the scroll out of that tomb?" <br/>* Make consequences interesting. Maybe the question isn't "do we find the clue?" Maybe it's "what consequences are there to searching for/finding the clue?" Like, successful roll = you find the clue and get away. Unsuccessful roll = You get the clue, but you're caught red-handed as you're pulling it out of the Mayor's desk (or maybe even before you pull it out of his desk, if getting the clue isn't absolutely necessary for the game to continue).<br/>* etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268501/#Comment_268501" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T06:45:01+00:00" title="April 23, 2010  6:45AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One technique I've often used in non-GUMSHOE games is to let the all the players present roll, and have the best roll find the clue first.<br/><br/>It takes care of the functional element (they need to find this clue to proceed), but also gives a reason for the players to enhance their characters' skills- getting more spotlight time.<br/><br/>Another potential technique which doesn't seem to have been mentioned is to gift the clue to the characters- but the roll determines how long (in game time) it takes to find it.

But in the long term, I see players getting bored and/or frustrated more often that not: for how many years can you play out "look around for the clue, not finding it anywhere... and then, miraculously, there it is!" Do it often enough and it gets old quick.<br/>* The GM has less fun, too, because s/he knows exactly what's going to happen. "Players look for clue" = "They search unsuccessfully for a while, then succeed." As a GM, there's zero suspense or interest there for me. I'd much rather have the players announce actions and then let the dice surprise us all. Because, if I'm doing the Ball and Cups thing, I've already effectively decided how things will turn out, and I'm just playing the game of pretending there's some suspense involved. That means less player input into the story (if any!), and no surprise for me at all. That gets boring and tiresome for the GM, as well, over the long term.<br/><br/>Overall, what it comes down to is that these methods (for me) create that feeling of:<br/><br/><cite>Posted By: wburdick</cite><br/>Dancing for pleasure:<br/>Actually, it is<b>I</b>who dance for<b>their</b>pleasure -- I do a lot of work for my players.  And after 3.5 years of playing in my games, they still love playing in them.  I have some game logs online if you want to see them. :P<br/></blockquote>\nYou see how he said that the players are dancing for your pleasure? And then you come back saying that, no, you're the one dancing for their pleasure?<br/><br/>In my experience, in such games, more often than not, BOTH parties start to feel like they're dancing for the other's pleasure. And they can still have fun doing that, sure. But I prefer by far a game where no one has to feel that way at all. Because, if you've decided the players are going to get the clue once they look in the fourth room of the castle, everything up until then is "dancing for their pleasure": we all have to pretend that something meaningful and suspenseful is going on, and pretend it's uncertain, and make it seem like fun at the same time. But we're just "dancing", because we already know how it's going to turn out.<br/><br/>That's my experience of the thing, anyway.<br/>I can see your position, but since I started role playing in the late 70s/early 80s, I've considered GMs for D&amp;D-like games (and FATE and PDQ when it comes down to it) to be story tellers and entertainers for the players.  Graham's, "Let them roll. They find it whether they succeed or fail, but the roll tells you whether there's a complication" and GB Steve's lead-following version of roll-until-you-succeed are both pretty good, I think.<br/><br/>But as far as experimenting with other systems, I'm all for that, obviously, since I combined Universalis with FATE and PDQ, although some have described that as Frankensteinian (which is kind of cool, to me) and I'm trying to make a variant of Blood Red Sands that's role-play-y, so I don't have to mash other things in with it (although having players play both their characters and the NPCs at the same time is a bit of a departure, but I think it works out to be conflict-of-interest-free).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268505/#Comment_268505" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T07:09:46+00:00" title="April 23, 2010  7:09AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Just for completeness, I can answer this, even though it wasn't aimed at me:<br/><br/><cite>Posted By: wburdick</cite><br/>So what's your answer to my question: "What does it mean when you make a Perception roll to search a desk? Does it mean you are guaranteed only to find things that aren't important to the story?"<br/><br/>From what you're writing, it sounds like either: A) "Yes, perception rolls are never really important to the story," or <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> "No, I'm making things up as I go along to fit their results, maybe like in Donjon."<br/><br/>B is essentially doing exactly what I do.<br/></blockquote>\nI don't think either of those are good, complete solutions. Here's how I look at it:<br/><br/>Rolling the dice isn't interesting. Choices are interesting. Consequences are interesting.<br/><br/>So, from that point of view, there are many different solutions to this issue. For example:<br/><br/>* Make finding the clue an interesting choice, not just a random outcome. Ok, you know the Mayor's got the letter in his desk. Are you willing to break into his house, become a criminal just like those you're fighting, to get it? Make it a choice, a meaningful choice that says something about the characters or puts something on the line. "Are you going to risk getting infected with the curse by going to retrieve the scroll out of that tomb?"<br/>* Make consequences interesting. Maybe the question isn't "do we find the clue?" Maybe it's "what consequences are there to searching for/finding the clue?" Like, successful roll = you find the clue and get away. Unsuccessful roll = You get the clue, but you're caught red-handed as you're pulling it out of the Mayor's desk (or maybe even before you pull it out of his desk, if getting the clue isn't absolutely necessary for the game to continue).<br/>* etc.<br/>I like these, but I don't see how the first allows a players to use their Investigation skill.  The second one is very much like Graham's second one, which I would choose, if I had to choose one or the other, because at least the PC's Investigation skill comes into play.  Luckily, I can use both of them, which I will definitely do if it comes up for me again!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268506/#Comment_268506" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T07:12:32+00:00" title="April 23, 2010  7:12AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Queex</cite>One technique I've often used in non-GUMSHOE games is to let the all the players present roll, and have the best roll find the clue first.<br/><br/>It takes care of the functional element (they need to find this clue to proceed), but also gives a reason for the players to enhance their characters' skills- getting more spotlight time.<br/><br/>Another potential technique which doesn't seem to have been mentioned is to gift the clue to the characters- but the roll determines how long (in game time) it takes to find it.

They're going to find it. So ask yourself: Where's the conflict in this situation? Why are we spending time focusing on this moment? Are there guards wandering the grounds or a deadly monster lurking? Is there a vicious trap? <br/><br/>When a player fails a search roll, or any roll really, the answer doesn't have to be a brick wall ("no sorry, you don't find anything"). You can throw in a complication instead. The characters find the ledger just as the crime bosses' goons burst through the door, pulls the mouldering tome from under a pile of junk as the giant spiders descend from the ceiling silently on silken threads, or notice the killer trap just as they're about to pull the ancient scroll from its case. <br/><br/>If you turn failures into opportunities to introduce complications and twists, you'll never have to play Three-Card Monte with your players again. <br/><br/>Also, I'd like to point out that despite Graham's assertion, there have always been plenty of indie games that require some GM prep, including: Sorcerer, Nine Worlds, With Great Power, the Riddle of Steel, The Shadow of Yesterday, Conspiracy of Shadows, Burning Wheel, Burning Empires, Mouse Guard, Dogs in the Vineyard, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268511/#Comment_268511" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T07:29:53+00:00" title="April 23, 2010  7:29AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neil</cite><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite><br/>This is pretty bad form:<br/>P: I search the room<br/>G: You don't find anything<br/>P: I search the room again<br/>G: Still nothing<br/>P: I search it one last time<br/>G: A clue!<br/><br/>This is great fun:<br/>P: I search the room.<br/>G: It's pretty disgusting.

In my blog post, the repeated roll example I gave was of a group walking through the jungle, being told to make perception every now and then as things happened around them, not searching, which is initiated by the players and doesn't make that much sense to repeat in the same place.<br/><br/>However, I think you could make a contrasting example just like GB Steve's for searching for secret doors along a corridor:<br/><br/>(import example 1)<br/><br/>This is great fun:<br/>P: I search for secret doors<br/>G: tapping and trying to move the rocks along the wall confirms that they are firmly in place<br/>P: I search further down the hall<br/>G: Same story here, but since you got such a good Perception roll, you noticed as you were tapping that you shook free some rock dust a little bit farther down<br/>P: I go to that area and check it out!<br/>G: one of the larger rocks has a chink out of it, creating a gap at the top<br/>P: I wedge my 10 foot pole in there!  I knew this would come in handy!<br/>...<br/><br/>At any point, if the players mess up a Perception roll, something else interesting happens, like accidentally knocking on a rock along a cleaving plane and making a huge racket.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268513/#Comment_268513" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T07:38:21+00:00" title="April 23, 2010  7:38AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm awfully surprised nobody has mentioned that one of the reason "ball and cups" might be beneficial is that it maintains investment in the game system as the means of interacting with the fictional world on both sides.

The short answer is that they really don't care.  My group is really very much more concerned about the story and not so much about specifics of mechanics.  They like the combat dice mini-games, and everything, but we were playing FATE.  Aspects overshadow the dice so much that it's usually not so much about the rolls anyway.<br/><br/>I don't use the things I'm talking about in my thread starter <b>that</b> much -- they're just in my tool box and I use them when I think they're appropriate.  I just wanted to hear some feedback on them.

The latter seems far more likely in my experience.<br/><br/>(Never mind, that came up in a cross-post already.)<br/><br/>But anyway, the question of <i>why</i> seems more interesting to me, all told. This is a possible way of arranging play, but the reason for why I don't do illusionism myself nowadays is that I don't construe of the fun activity of play that I want to do in those terms. Bill is describing how he approaches the task of GMing, but equally or even more important is why he's doing so - it seems that the reason is in how he considers himself the preparer and gatekeeper of the story the other players get to experience. If you do not share this understanding of the player responsibilities, the whole question of why not do illusionism doesn't even come up. In other words: it's not that I don't know how to do this, but that I don't want the type of enjoyment that can be achieved in this way.<br/><br/>As an example of the the differences in type of fun, the spotlight thing: I don't even understand what "spotlight" means as a term pertaining to enjoyment of play in this context. Having it be <i>your</i> character that finds the clue seems like a primitive and mis-construed enjoyment that is only possible when there's nothing better to have in the game. It only seems sad to me that a player would have so little to do in a game that they would actually feel gratified by getting to roll dice and having the GM pat them on the head for rolling well. (I specifically use the word "seems" here because there probably is a different explanation aside from frustration for why somebody would be invested in getting to have their character do a cool action pose.) I'm sure that this makes perfect sense in some specific type of adventure play, perhaps something where the players have to fight for their right to participate, but it's alien to the sort of ways I've been playing this decade.<br/><br/>As for why I dislike illusionism of this sort, I guess it's because I grew tired of it through the latter part of the '90s. It wasn't helping us play purposefully, and having to be the dancing bear for the group felt like a too big responsibility and too one-sided as a creative exercise; it simply wasn't worth it for me to twist myself into a pretzel for the enjoyment of a couple of passive friends when I could just as well write a short story or a novel that'd be appreciated more intensively by more people. So it didn't work for me as an artist; I needed to get a different type of kick from roleplaying, something where my enjoyment would be more than the satisfaction of getting to show off my cleverness to an appreciative but ultimately passive audience. Roleplaying started to really interest me more only when I discarded all pretension of being responsible for an amazing artistic experience and began to focus on the interactive aspect: who I play with, what do they want, what do they bring to the game and so on. Let them love the great thing we make together, not my leet skillz as a GM. Illusionism doesn't fare well in that context because the very approach is objectifying towards the players: when I lie to the players for their benefit I'm using them as tools of my show, making me the only real actor in the interaction.<br/><br/>My issue is not with advance prep or mysteries as a core of adventure or any of that; I just don't like having to be the one who decides what happens, and that's what it boils down to if a bulk of the game's focus is on issues that can only really fall one way for the GM's masterplan to come to fruition. Moving the important clue from one place to another is not that different from moving a great Bang from one place to another (something that you're expected to do in many games) as a technique; the difference is in why you're doing it. In one game you're moving fictional elements behind the scenes to make sure that the wrong choice a player made has no lasting impact on the plot, while in the other you're making sure that the players get to make the important choices about the scenario. Thus, one of these techniques is directed at keeping control in the hands of the GM, while another is for making sure that the players get to make interesting choices. It's this level of intentions in the background of the techniques utilized in play that determines whether the techniques work for me.<br/><br/>(All that being said - FATE sure explains a lot here. The game's all but designed for participationism. Cheating with the rules is all but par for the course in this case.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268567/#Comment_268567" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T10:47:12+00:00" title="April 23, 2010 10:47AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For certain kinds of traditional-ish play, this is not really about task resolution OR conflict resolution.

Each check is an opportunity to add some color to the story of "how you found the clue".<br/><br/>A lot of players really, really like exploring the color of the game.

However, I've yet to see why what Bill's told us is not illusionistic - is there some core of play in there that actually revolves around interaction? Seems to me that what the players love in Bill's game is the good story he facilely brings out. The usual suspects for interactive play, such as combat scenes, seem like an after-thought from how he describes it.<br/><br/>In case somebody might get the wrong impression, I'll reiterate that it's not a technical problem I have with anything here; it's simply the fact that I don't much care for the GM's story as a focus of play. If an ability check is used to say "not yet" and the delay actually has some interesting content, and the ultimate pay-off is actually something else than the GM's story, then I don't really have any personal preference against the technique itself.<br/><br/>And, of course, if somebody finds joy in playing the dancing bear, more power to them. Nothing against others having fun.<br/><br/>Also, a secondary point: I believe that everybody likes Color. Different groups just need different techniques for bringing it to the fore. My own pet theory is that Color is often not a big deal with Forgista games because they presuppose joint creative interest; the most brutish games simply assume that you'll be chattering happily about the fictional details with no systematic incentive for it at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268579/#Comment_268579" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T11:26:03+00:00" title="April 23, 2010 11:26AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, since there have been a few comments here about me showing off my leet skillz, I guess I ought to explain that I have much more of a servant mentality towards my players than must be common for some people.  So I'm talking about all of this in the context of "games like D&amp;D".<br/><br/>(I can't believe I'm about to explain this on story-games.com)<br/><br/>OK, games like FATE and PDQ have specific hooks for spotlighting (aspects and foibles/negative qualities).  Compels are all about spotlighting.  Spotlighting makes good stories.  Maybe not the kind you like to play, but we were playing SotC followed by a PDQ/FATE mashup.  Is spotlighting inherently wrong -- when you're playing FATE or PDQ?  Does that mean I'm taking the role of a benevolent medieval priest and patting my parishioners on the head?  Gee, I thought I was, you know, GMing for FATE and PDQ.<br/><br/>Folks, does it all have to be about power?  Really?  Isn't that petty and feeble?  Maybe some people play RPGs because they're all about power.  I don't need to get fake power from making up stories.  I'm 43 and I play games in game stores with college students.  Where's the power in that?  I pity people who feel power from playing pretend.  They should do... something!  How about, volunteering with a soup kitchen?<br/><br/>When I run D&amp;D-like games, I usually do a ton of preparation and hard thinking to try to make the story about the PCs.  Spotlighting with skill checks is one tiny, tiny way to do that.  Connecting the NPCs to the histories of the PCs is another.  One example: a player made his PC an orphan so that it could come up in the story later.  So, I had him find out that his father was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastasio_Somoza_Debayle" rel="nofollow">Anastasio Samosa Debayle</a> by way of a bunch of Nicaraguan goons after him with a death warrant.  Later, that character found out that he had siblings that were also being eradicated.<br/><br/>FATE 2e even had mechanics to pay a fate point to deliver an uninterrupted monologue, James Bond villain-style.  How's that for spot-lighting?  Spirit of the Century is <b>pulp</b>, which is all about telling the heroes' stories.  Games like this have a GM who writes or runs a story so, um, yeah, the GM is the "gatekeeper" of the story.  Isn't that how people usually play games like D&amp;D?  It's how they present themselves in the rules.

However, I've yet to see why what Bill's told us is not illusionistic - is there some core of play in there that actually revolves around interaction? Seems to me that what the players love in Bill's game is the good story he facilely brings out. The usual suspects for interactive play, such as combat scenes, seem like an after-thought from how he describes it.<br/><br/>In case somebody might get the wrong impression, I'll reiterate that it's not a technical problem I have with anything here; it's simply the fact that I don't much care for the GM's story as a focus of play. If an ability check is used to say "not yet" and the delay actually has some interesting content, and the ultimate pay-off is actually something else than the GM's story, then I don't really have any personal preference against the technique itself.<br/><br/>And, of course, if somebody finds joy in playing the dancing bear, more power to them. Nothing against others having fun.<br/><br/>Also, a secondary point: I believe that everybody likes Color. Different groups just need different techniques for bringing it to the fore. My own pet theory is that Color is often not a big deal with Forgista games because they presuppose joint creative interest; the most brutish games simply assume that you'll be chattering happily about the fictional details with no systematic incentive for it at all.</blockquote>\nAbout dancing bears: If you're ever in Israel, I urge you to go to the hall of independence in Tel Aviv and hear the story told in true, Middle Eastern story-teller fashion.

I guess that's why my blog is titled with an unprovable statement?<br/><br/>We have a lot of good memories of those campaigns.  Like I said earlier, I didn't tell them what I was doing until the end (or close to it at least) of the first campaign.  They couldn't tell when I was using these techniques and I didn't use them very much -- it's not like this characterizes my campaigns or anything.  This is just one of the things I do sometimes..  I asked them a few times after that when I used them in the other campaign and they still didn't notice it.

For instance, a noirish scenario where an important clue comes from the deceased's on-again off-again girlfriend -- if the players don't realize the significance of the clue, or take the wrong approach with her and get her to shut down, well, they can go back and talk to her again later, and that has a good chance of both being productive in terms of the nuts and bolts of the story *and* ratcheting up the dramatic tension.  But if the important clue was supposed to come from a DNA sample, and the lab tech player botched his Laboratory Use roll, you're out of luck.<br/><br/>Investigations always involve two stories that are intertwined: there's the story of what actually happened -- the chain of motivations and events leading up to the murder (for instance), and immediately following it -- and the story of how it was discovered -- the investigator following the trail of evidence and clues.  If you've got a traditional GM/players dynamic going on, then one of the most straightforward ways for this to work is for the GM to know the story of what actually happened in detail.  So if the handouts deal with that aspect of things, then the skill checks do not determine *what* the players find out so much as *when* they find it out.  (I will concede that it's possible for the investigated plot to be developed at the same time as the investigation plot, but my attempts at doing that have been less successful because it's very easy to get caught in a contradiction.)<br/><br/>And as far as the dynamics around skill checks and giving the players clues -- my take on that is, if the GM is going to call for a skill roll, there should be something interesting that happens as the result of either success or failure.  Sometimes, depending on the mood of the table, a flatly narrated skill check -- "You search the room, and man o man is it a mess, but you don't find anything that seems to relate" -- is sufficiently interesting because the players will treat it as a goad to try another approach.  Other times, "You find nothing" is more of a frustration than a goad, and the right answer is something that says yes-but -- the characters find the clue they need, but with a complication, as suggested.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268918/#Comment_268918" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T03:09:49+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  3:09AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            'Search' rolls are for finding hidden things. If something isn't hidden, if they specifically state they are searching the correct place straight away or something like that, I see no point in making them roll the dice. That way leads forcing players to roll when they need to find a fifty foot statue in the middle of a grassy plane that's totally flat in all directions for several miles. When they're standing on its head. If the players know or can work out where to look through logic, I don't see any need to disturb the sleeping dice.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Search rolls are good for allowing the players to discover excess junk that is useful, but not necessarily vital to the ongoing storyline.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268922/#Comment_268922" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T04:06:13+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  4:06AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cwilbur</cite>I learned long ago that as far as mysteries go, situations where the characters can keep on going back to the source are *much* more gameable than situations where the source is a one-and-done thing.  For instance, a noirish scenario where an important clue comes from the deceased's on-again off-again girlfriend -- if the players don't realize the significance of the clue, or take the wrong approach with her and get her to shut down, well, they can go back and talk to her again later, and that has a good chance of both being productive in terms of the nuts and bolts of the story *and* ratcheting up the dramatic tension.  But if the important clue was supposed to come from a DNA sample, and the lab tech player botched his Laboratory Use roll, you're out of luck.</blockquote>\nI came to the same realization, too.<br/><br/>Also, from a GM's perspective, playing the deceased's on-again off-again girlfriend is a hell of a lot more fun than telling the lab tech "the sample is contaminated, and no useful conclusions can be drawn from the test."  (I suspect this could be generalized as "interacting with people is always more fun than narrating to people," but maybe that's a comment for another thread.)<br/><br/>The downside to this approach is that sometimes a player wants to be a lab tech.  I'm totally stealing Irminsul's technique for the next time that happens: converting failure from a dead end to an obvious complication which must be overcome is fucking brilliant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Do you deceive your players?

If you've got a traditional GM/players dynamic going on, then one of the most straightforward ways for this to work is for the GM to know the story of what actually happened in detail.  So if the handouts deal with that aspect of things, then the skill checks do not determine *what* the players find out so much as *when* they find it out.  (I will concede that it's possible for the investigated plot to be developed at the same time as the investigation plot, but my attempts at doing that have been less successful because it's very easy to get caught in a contradiction.)</blockquote>\nI like your explanation of mysteries as two intertwined stories; I hadn't seen that before.  This makes me think that it might work to do mysteries like that in a shared GMing game, by creating both stories at the same time.  Very cool!

I'm a bit stressed for time lately, so I won't write an essay; but here's my take on the 'cheating' of the GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I think the mood, flavor, and GOAL of the game, including its players and GM really affect how one perceives the methods used.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor our group,  playing SotC and Fate/PDQ;  those games are very rules light.   The use of aspects and fate points to allow a player to sometimes dramatically change important details of the story;  heavily relies upon all players and GM to accept a more fluid storyline, and be willing to change their perception of the game's reality at a moment's notice.  These games are ALL about the story of your character,  an epic "pulp" story for them to star in, and their interactions with the other "pulp heroes".   <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that focus on story over rules  (not that there aren't rules, just that they're light and fluid rules) really changes the dynamic of playing and GMing the game.   In other games, such as D&amp;D, Rifts, even World of Darkness;  the rules are so in depth,  the background, story, NPC factions, just about everything is written out and given to the GM and players.   This creates a "sandbox" environment where there are two possibilities for most GM's.   1)  you write your 'adventure' and sorta railroad your players from beginning to end; relying on their rolls to determine exact details.   I relate this much to a 'Choose Your Own Adventure'.  When a roll comes up either it passes or fails.  The result sends the PC's down one of two paths.  Many times,  GM's will find ways to have future rolls guide the PC's down a previous path that they had missed,  much like a CYOA.    2) GM's write plot hooks, and mini-modules and allow the PC's to play within 'the sandbox'.  They do whatever they want,  you dangle plot hooks in front of them, and hope they take the bait.   If they don't then you have to come up with new material, or atleast a new way to present the plot hooks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what makes the difference in SotC is that when these tactics are deployed;  it isn't a hard fast scenario where "If the PC's pass the roll A happens, if they fail the roll B happens",  its more of a scenario of "The end result of this scene is X happens,  the players rolls leading up to X determine future plot hooks,  consequences and story for the PC"<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example of this was a scene where we were chasing an NPC up a path the circles a volcano (sorta) to the top.    The scene included a built in timer that based on the players rolls would either slow down or speed up.  (A stack of fate points that either got points added to it or subtracted)   When it runs out, "something bad happens".   This was a way to create urgency, and while the knowledge of the "doom clock" and "something bad" effectively breaks the 4th wall; because of the flavor of SotC;  we are accustomed to changing the story through Aspects and other mechanics.   Now the "cheating" in this scene by the GM (wburdick) was that the end result was the same regardless of our rolls.   However, the reason that it WORKED was because thats how the scene was intended to be run.   The magic of it wasn't "can we beat the doom clock",  it was the Consequences we took on our characters attempting to beat it.   In our games,  the first consequence you take gets recorded by the GM, and a plot gets written specifically tied to that consequence.   So the hidden mechanics of the seen were really "how will the players react to a timed, dire situation?"  and "what consequences will they face?".     <br/>\n<br/>\nSince we were unaware that there was no "winning" the scene, it made for a huge sense of urgency; many of the characters gave it their all, and through the use of tying future plots in with "first consequences"  our rolls actually shaped the future of the storyline.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing to understand is that these tactics aren't used in every scene,  they are used to make sure portions of the story that the GM has spent significant time developing find their way into game.   Most GM's openly railroad their players into such scenes;  wburdick has found clever ways to railroad his players without them feeling like they're being railroaded.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI also think our group approaches RPG's a bit differently than a lot of players do.   What I mean by this, is that I can't think of a single person we play with that would ever get upset by something bad happening to their character.   We're so plugged into making a cool story that we often volunteer for bad things to happen to our characters.   I think SotC really plays into that along with the PDQ/Fate mashups.   When we take "damage" in the form of consequences, it becomes fun in and of itself to come up with a badass explanation for the consequence.   Several of our characters have ended up scarred, mamed, and lost loved ones throughout the course of the games.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end,  it's really all about the story and I think given that context, none of us are worried about there being hard-fast rules.   If I want a rules lawyer,  I'll go play D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12000/do-you-deceive-your-players-i-do-and-they-love-it" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12000/do-you-deceive-your-players-i-do-and-they-love-it" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12000/do-you-deceive-your-players-i-do-and-they-love-it/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12000%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12000%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
