I was doing it by hand with some dice and tables and stuff and then considering the elements in the sketch that's semi-randomly produced to flesh it into an actual thing.  That's working OK and now I'm trying to see how much of the process can reasonably be automated.<br/><br/>The application that I'm working on currently spits out stuff <a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B-nymD-keMSTMEgwQlNZTk1EYUE" rel="nofollow">like this</a><br/><br/>So, if you're interested in playing along, if you were building some kind of encounter/adventure based on that image, what would you produce?  Go do that and post it here.  And if you're doing that, you might not want to read below here before doing so.  I'll make something from it and post it in a while.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382986/#Comment_382986" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-21T13:17:06+00:00" title="June 21, 2012  1:17PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2012 1:18PM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I only just realized there's this thing I do with these.  One of the first things is to look for circles that are all alone and circles that are touching.  And I think about why they're like that.  Why is the treasure isolated?  Why are zombies and a trap next to one another?  Also, what's the scale?  Sometimes it's as much as miles across the skeletal map but it's more likely to all be within a 200 feet.<br/><br/>So <a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B-nymD-keMSTTzN0RXhPSVVyZGc" rel="nofollow">this</a> is a quick example of what I'd develop that blank sheet into.  (Hopefully you can read it, my hand-lettering is quite poor.)  I could have made it a dungeon instead.  And maybe I will later.  When I do that, it never feels like the same encounter.<br/><br/>Something interesting (to me, at least) is that when I'm using dice and tables, I fudge results all over the place.  "Wait, so I have a mutant, barbarians, a monster <i>and</i> a demon...no, that's crazy, that demon is more barbarians."  But when the computer spits it out, I feel more constrained.  That's dumb.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382989/#Comment_382989" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-21T13:22:44+00:00" title="June 21, 2012  1:22PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and even if you're not playing along, if you've done something like this and have interesting things to say about it or helpful suggestions, I'd like to hear them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383008/#Comment_383008" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-21T15:00:03+00:00" title="June 21, 2012  3:00PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would throw a hex map over top of it and make it a wilderness area. The hexes could be pretty small-scale, because of the individual nature of the entries.<br/><br/>Or, I would consider them malleable suggestions for settlements. Wilderfolk are villages or nomad grazing areas. E (trap) is obviously Khare Cityport of Traps and and G (zombie) is the necropolis suburbia that provides the city with free slave labour. A (valuables) is the Golden Palace or the City of Crystal Towers or the Jewelled Throne, where the great sultana rules from. And either the wild animal cities are home to rival factions of dragontamers and lionriders or the people who live there are beastmen, part human, part animal.<br/><br/>In either case, I would suggest a random wilderness terrain generator that you could lay over top. I don't think I would draw dungeon corridors on your map to connect the dots. I prefer to randomly generate the dungeon map and roll for contents afterward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383014/#Comment_383014" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-21T15:30:56+00:00" title="June 21, 2012  3:30PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            hex map ==&gt; instant flavour!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383016/#Comment_383016" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-21T16:12:02+00:00" title="June 21, 2012  4:12PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This doesn't exactly help you, or answer the question, but this is what I'm reminded of:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.spiritcaat.com/gifs/spreads/celtic_cross_spread.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
