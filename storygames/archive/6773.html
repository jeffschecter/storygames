I can think of a couple ways you could do it:<br/><br/>a) GM specifies that it's an "overrun" encounter just based on the description, so if the PCs lose that area is now menace-infested in addition to any conditions (a GM might not use this option if the description was something minimal not the horde, aka "the corpse of that one security guard you saw gets up")<br/><br/>b) make overrun an automatic result of any lost conflict (kind of like A but the default -- which might depend on the definition of the scenario)<br/><br/>c) Players can choose Overrun as a condition, which let's them get away unharmed but makes the location infested (naturally still counts towards their "three strikes" condition count). It's tempting because the character isn't impaired, but if more than one player takes overrun as the result of the same conflict you could have that many "adjacent" areas immediately infested as well  -- do you take an Injury or let the zombies swarm the safehouse? (adjacent might be a fuzzy term, so if you can't determine adjacent it could be the next X new locations defined or something) You could even up the ante and make even one Overrun condition two locations -- the current location and one adjacent.<br/><br/>I think the missing bit is that to have a definition of overrun you need a definition of safe. When the heroes are boarded up inside a house, how are they actually safer than going outside? Mechanically they aren't.<br/><br/>On second thought, maybe it's the other way around. Maybe overrun is the opposite of advantage dice -- you go to some locations and the menace gets bonus dice there because, jeez, there are hordes of zombies milling around. That's a much stronger approach, because otherwise there's really no difference between hiding and waiting to be attacked or marching out and knowing you'll be in a fight. This way fleeing and hiding is mechanically safer, and if you want to go back to the lab to get the secret weapon you have to face the hordes...<br/><br/>You could even include a scenario option where the menace gets dice that can be placed on locations when they are defined, again like advantage dice in reverse, but also let them be added when a location is overrun later. An an easy scenario might start 1-1-2 dice, a harder scenario 1-1-1-2-2-3, etc.<br/><br/>Will it ruin moments like Ripley strapping on her weapons and going to face the Alien queen in her lair? Not sure.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150645/#Comment_150645" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T17:15:38+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  5:15PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Overrun as a condition is pretty sweet.

Before I comment on your specific suggestions (which are very cool), let me back up and fill you in on how I've been proceeding so far.<br/><br/>I've been thinking recently that there are a couple different styles of survival horror menaces, notably, the split between having a single menace which is potentially anywhere and having a menace horde whose locations are more known but gradually expanding to include everything.  Alien and Alien 3 feature the solo menace, for example, while Aliens and Alien Resurrection feature the horde.  Slasher movies are solo, zombie movies are horde, etc. The basic Geiger rules that we've been playing with do a good job of taking care of solo menaces, but do less well with hordes, which is why Black &amp; Gaunt has, as you've noticed, been suggesting a slightly different approach to me.<br/><br/>For a seperate point... in play, some of the coolest moments I can remember have happened due to relatively drastic changes to the map.  I remember a school in the original "Storm Windows" slasher movie playtest, where a car was picked up by the storm and hurled into the belltower, causing it to collapse into the school auditorium.  Instantly, two locations became one.  My inspiration for this may have been the final dungeon in Zelda for Game Boy, where you use an item to destroy four pillars and cause the entire four-level tower dungeon to collapse into a single level, combining the features of all four levels into a new "fifth" level.  Also, in some of the space-station games we've played, it's been really fun to blow up locations or cut off the gravity or oxygen in certain locations, or seal off some rooms to make them impassable.  I'd really like for there to mechanical support for this kind of thing, maybe in the form of Disadvantage Dice (which the Menace rolls extra in that location or, separately, players moving through it have to roll against or gain a Condition, without the Menace even doing anything).<br/><br/>So, if we can work both those ideas into this "overrun" mechanic, allowing people to manipulate the map and what locations mean, and also making a mechanical or procedure-based distinction between solo menace behavior and horde menace behavior, I think we're gold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150663/#Comment_150663" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T18:15:50+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  6:15PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>I've been thinking recently that there are a couple different styles of survival horror menaces, notably, the split between having a single menace which is potentially anywhere and having a menace horde whose locations are more known but gradually expanding to include everything</blockquote>\nYou are absolutely right about those two branches. An overt discussion of those two types and more mechanical support in the system to reinforce that concept would rock.<br/><br/>It sound like it would be one of the key decisions during the setup, though it might be good to leave room for a menace trait to flip from one to the other unexpectedly (like in this game, where it started off looking like one but turned out to be many).<br/><br/>But don't think Geiger Counter doesn't work great with hordes now -- it's just up to the current GM to frame scenes and decide that attacks occur if you go places that logically should be dangerous.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Also, in some of the space-station games we've played, it's been really fun to blow up locations or cut off the gravity or oxygen in certain locations, or seal off some rooms to make them impassable.</blockquote>\nThat is a supremely cool idea. Maybe that's another resulting condition? Or maybe the GM or players can really can just redefine locations based on described actions -- which I think I like more. If the players say they are decoupling the last few cars in the train and no one is stopping them, fine they just do it and the end of the train falls away. If the menace is there and they are trying it... well that sounds like a conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150787/#Comment_150787" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-14T18:14:22+00:00" title="June 14, 2008  6:14PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, it does hordes okay, but it's not designed for them, so folks have to improvise.  I'd like to make it a bit easier.<br/><br/>I was also thinking that there should be ways to sabotage locations in an effort to impede the menace.  Like, you know how they set up those computerized guns in Aliens to try to slow the creatures down, but then subsequently lost control of the base?  Especially in situations where you were running a chase-based map, with a bunch of locations arranged in a row leading to your escape, I think it'd be cool of you could attempt to bolt doors closed and blow up tunnels along the way, to try to stay one step ahead.  Then you could have cool scenes like the raptors opening doors in Jurassic Park.  But sabotaging rooms would also make them dangerous or more difficult for other characters (or yourself) to move through them as well.<br/><br/>So maybe you can take advantage dice and turn them into something else... hazard dice?  And these are always fixed in a given location.  Anybody in that location has to roll against the hazard or take a condition.  And the menace horde overrunning specific locations could be meaured in hazard dice that add to the menace's threat in that location.  So, even if the menace was down to a couple of dice, if you're running through zombie-controlled territory, the menace still poses a serious threat.<br/><br/>I'll have to think about how something like that would effect the balance of the game, though.  Geiger Counter's balance isn't perfect anyway, but this would complicate it further.<br/><br/>One other thing:  I'm pretty sure the next version is going to measure play in "rounds" or "acts," a round being when each player has framed a scene.  And there will be general narrative guidelines and maybe even some mechanical triggers that happen in each round.  Like, first round, menace can't attack survivors but can take out NPCs and gain dice.  Second round, menace starts attacking survivors.  Third round, menace's traits have all been defined and the conflict gets really deadly.  Fourth round, climactic confrontation.  Fifth round, epilogues, false or otherwise.  Something like that.  How do you cats feel about that?  Too much structure, or helpful in trying to figure out pacing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151015/#Comment_151015" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T09:35:26+00:00" title="June 16, 2008  9:35AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All the games I've played have tended to have a fairly loose structure.  The first round usually goes around the circle and makes sure everyone has a scene to frame things starting out, but after that, it tends to jump around the table to whoever has an idea for a scene at the moment.  If more than one person has a scene they'd like to frame, then the person who hasn't been director for the longest amount of time gets precedent.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if a more structured setup would be better or worse (or just different), but I suspect it would depend on the group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151031/#Comment_151031" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T11:01:07+00:00" title="June 16, 2008 11:01AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure pacing needs more rules -- I like being able to draw things out if desired, or having the option to have an early unexpected death if it fits the concept. I am a little leery of adding too much complexity or structure. The system is pretty light and flexible right now, which is awesome.<br/><br/>As for adding rounds specifically, there's an odd bit of math there. Since you already count up to 8 to pace the menace dice, adding pacing based on the number of players could have unpredictable results: if there's only three players, the menace isn't even at full power by round 3, but there are 5 players it is, etc.<br/><br/>So I guess my first reaction is: "too mechanical, if it ain't broke don't fix it" which is to say that your current "count up to 8" mechanic works fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151034/#Comment_151034" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T11:13:04+00:00" title="June 16, 2008 11:13AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm... okay, so maybe more of a series of pacing suggestions, rather than explicit guidelines.

I guess this helps the players who feel less comfortable framing scenes, but I would also worry that they would be less engaged or, over the course of a lot of play like this, they would just decide that they shouldn't ever frame scenes, that it's someone else's role to do that because they aren't good at it.

GM frames a scene of the menace hitting the trap and the characters are just monitoring things remotely. Less dice because no character is involved but also no risk of them taking conditions.<br/><br/>If you wanted a minor rules add, use the "stationary advantages get +1 dice" idea. That way the players get a bonus for taking a mobile thing like guns or traps and setting them up stationary and having them fight remotely.<br/><br/>A lot of special cases like this (traps, sealing areas, destroying areas, whatever) could go in an "advanced tricks" appendix so players wouldn't have to think about it if they didn't need it.
