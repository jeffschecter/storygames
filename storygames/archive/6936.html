It sounds interesting.<br/><br/>The short answer is that Mike has a theory that many (most? all?) "story games" rely on the culture and play priorities of their adherents in order to function. And the evidence is that if you give a game like Universalis, My Life with Master, Sorcerer, etc., into a different culture (hardcore board gamers, perhaps?), that the games don't work as intended by the designer ("Wait, you played the whole game without roleplaying at all?").<br/><br/>The wrinkle that's interesting to me is how this reliance on the culture becomes problematic when you're designing a game (like Acts of Evil, or In A Wicked Age, or Blood Red Sands) which requires player behavior that differs from the culture's biases.<br/><br/>Paul                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154450/#Comment_154450" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T12:23:10+00:00" title="July  2, 2008 12:23PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a pretty cool insight, which has some really challenging consequences. Some good, some bad. Neat! Mike usually manages to make my head explode. He did the same at Forge Midwest. Clever boy.<br/><br/>I've been thinking about different issues lately, but I think they're related. That is, the current "scene" -- which is really hard to define, so let's leave it at that -- has moved from innovators to somewhere mid or past early adopters. And, the result is that the innovators are a bit lost, or maybe even cynical now.<br/>I think I'm one of those, but I'm not sure. (That's not really a joke! So sad.)<br/><br/>Anyway, the implication is that the culture has expanded to a level that will start to draw virtual circles around what's in and what's out, and all the good and bad things those entail. For example, it's good because without such circles, new people get lost as to what the hell's going on and how to participate. It's bad because things on the fringe get cast out for good or ill. Whether those things survive elsewhere, who knows.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154452/#Comment_154452" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T12:33:44+00:00" title="July  2, 2008 12:33PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But with designers who are paying attention there is a feedback from those people who have problems with the game.

The sub-text appears to be "Because you can't hand the game to ANYONE and have it work as intended, the game is busted."  I'm not sure that's true.  That's very much a System is Everything approach rather than a System Matters approach.  One of the hardest thing I had about explaining the idea behind System Matters and Reward Cycles to a friend once was that the idea was not to design a game that MAKES people play a certain way but rather makes playing a certain way EASIER for people who *already want to play that way*.<br/><br/>Now one of the things that I've been talking about lately in various places is the idea that games need to be clearer about what "that way" is up front.  I sometimes talk about the Social Mandate which I define as the minimum creative enthusiasm that needs to brought to the game socially to make it work.  In Spione the Social Mandate is The Cold.  People need to be interested in and excited about the Spy vs. Guy dynamic and WANT to put that into play *first*.  Without that social engine the game dies, fast.<br/><br/>In My Life with Master the power dynamic between The Minion and The Master has to be interesting to the players on an authorial level *first*.  The Individual Wants vs. Community Needs problem in Dogs in the Vineyard has to be compelling to the players *first*.  <br/><br/>Yup with out those play priorities in play ahead of time these games die.  I don't think that's a bad thing.  I kind of see it as a feature.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154460/#Comment_154460" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T12:48:50+00:00" title="July  2, 2008 12:48PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>Hey Bill,<br/>The wrinkle that's interesting to me is how this reliance on the culture becomes problematic when you're designing a game (like Acts of Evil, or In A Wicked Age, or Blood Red Sands) which requires player behavior that differs from the culture's biases.</blockquote>\nI want to hear more about this, Paul.

Sorry. I should have explained what I meant.<br/><br/>So, there's this thing called the adoption curve. I'm no expert on it. It's mainly used for business planning and marketing. <br/><br/>Anyway, the curve is an average of the amount of user-acceptance a product has over time. It's a bell curve. So, the first wave is Innovators. They're VERY tiny, but super-high-interest people who want the Hotness for its own sake. The next group are Early Adopters, who are people interested in the promise the product offers, which is usually a new or different thing. <br/><br/>The next two groups are the big part of the bell curve. They're the mainstream split in half. Together, they're half the market. The early accepters and the late accepters (I forget their proper names in the model). Finally, the Late Adopters (like, my parents finally getting high-speed internet in the year 2012) and the Laggards (I'll still use the phone, thanks.)<br/><br/>My point is that folks like Paul and I MIGHT be innovators in the adopting indie games sense. (Not sure; we might be Early Adopters.) But, that many people "after" us are higher up the bell curve. And, thus, people like me are finding less reward out of the the "scene." I, for one, am a bit lost at sea, culturally speaking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154471/#Comment_154471" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T13:05:44+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  1:05PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From reading a bunch of the conversations on Culture of Play, I think folks are starting to realize this all over the place, not just Mike.  I think <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2008/05/28/a-different-approach-to-theory/" rel="nofollow">the communities of practice approach to thinking about games</a> is one of the reactions to it, focusing more on how people implement a set of rules at the table.<br/><br/>In the past, I think people have focused on the negative, 'mystery cult' aspects of the post-Forge game scene, where people sometimes need somebody within the community to teach you how to do basic things like framing scenes or sharing narrative authority or other staples that we tend to reference without describing.  But there are positive aspects too, like the way this creates a network of actual people who know and have played games with each other (that's partially what ties us all together, yeah?).  I don't think it's surprising that person-to-person rather than text-to-person is a flat-out better way of transmitting play practices, but people always seem to feel guilty or conflicted about embracing that fact and using texts as supplementary, rather than primary teaching tools.<br/><br/>That said, I also hope that the longer playtest / ashcan publishing model that seems to be developing will lead people to do more outside playtesting and text reviews with people who come from different backgrounds.  We can definitely all get better at crafting texts too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154472/#Comment_154472" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T13:07:58+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  1:07PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, question: Do you feel like the play preferences exhibited in recent indie games don't fit your preferred style?

Take a genre like First-person Shooter, or Real-time Strategy and compare the earliest games and their players against the games and players years later and you see a greater diversity of game elements (map modes, weapons, etc.) and more diversity of players for the earlier games than you do after the genre has evolved, and become hard core. Over time the fanbase of a video game genre becomes increasingly hard core (i.e. rarefied), smaller, and intolerant of game functionality that violates encultured biases.<br/><br/>I think we see that evolution happening with story games. Frame scenes--&gt;drive for conflict,--&gt;set stakes--&gt;resolve--&gt;adjust stats--&gt;and narrate has become the de-facto structure of play. If a player bringing that de-facto play structure to your game breaks your game, you have a problem you need to correct for in your game, somehow.<br/><br/>(Interestingly, as a video game genre evolves, the barrier to entry into the market for the producer becomes higher and higher, from increased costs for developing for the increasingly hardcore fanbase. But with RPG genres, the barrier to entry actually goes down, as the encultured structures of play contribute to the functioning and playability of games designed in the hard core of a given genre.)<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154478/#Comment_154478" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T13:23:23+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  1:23PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Guy,<br/><br/>I agree, this is all very much as true for trad RPGs as for story games.

This is because a lot of role-playing games don't give you complete procedures for play and so you need to invent your own procedures to fill in the gaps.  So we learn that "Well, I did this while playing Vampire, no reason not to do it while playing 7th Sea."<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that habit has ported over into story games which have (more) complete procedures.  People think Stakes are neat so they start using them in ALL their games, despite some games are specifically designed NOT to use them.  "Say yes, or roll the dice" is very very specific to the Giving mechanics of Dogs in the Vineyard but people use it like it's a universal mantra.  Ron has actually said that "Say yes, or roll the dice" does NOT apply to Sorcerer.  In Sorcerer if there's a conflict you roll, period, saying "Yes" will actually screw up the dynamic of that game.<br/><br/>The problem is that all of these are RULES specific to the games that spawned them and not just "ideas" to use or discard at leisure like "GM advice" in older games.  Trying to use Stakes in In A Wicked Age is like constantly rolling a d6 and wondering where your token is while paying Poker.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154502/#Comment_154502" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T14:20:14+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  2:20PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2008 2:20PM by Jesse.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grant Davis</cite><br/>I just bought Grey Ranks this weekend.

There wasn't one like it before. Many, many people helped create that, and I participated for my part. That's awesome! And, it's still evolving. Also awesome. Except for Graham. It's not flawless. But, it is pretty awesome.<br/><br/>In short, this is what was <i>supposed</i> to happen. I am genuinely pleased about that.<br/><br/>To answer your question: The culture isn't as rewarding as it was for me because it's no longer about "fixing" my hobby (which was thrilling) and it is now about grooving on the "fixed" hobby. That SHOULD also be thrilling, but my particular circumstances are not fixed. Hence, less rewarding for me. <br/><br/>Oh, I suppose that's bound to change for the better sooner or later. But, it is where I'm at right now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Paul -- <br/><br/>I remember that article; you linked to it before. And, I think we've talked about it some. The spiral of the hard core is pretty fascinating. There are some sounds reasons to cater to the hard core, which we haven't talked about before. BUT, I don't see those reasons as being in effect in the case of comics or video games as we've discussed. (The good reason mainly is: Once your product is mature enough, you have a cash cow of the hard core which you milk to fund new products aimed at a larger, less hard core audience.

The games squarely situated within that culture tend, more and more, to either be (a) not in my wheelhouse in terms of subejct matter and procedures of play, and therefore not as interesting as they might have been when the techniques were still paradigm-breaking or (b) right smack-dab on center with my interests and approach, but sufficiently distant from anything anyone else I know is remotely interested in that I have trouble getting functional play out of them.<br/><br/>I suspect that may describe a lot of people's relationship with the "story-games style" - the innovation, for us, has already happened, and now that the style is maturing there's less interest in any one, specific implementation unless it happens to hit their buttons in terms of fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154520/#Comment_154520" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T15:18:06+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  3:18PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's definitely true that indie design has reached a comfortable plateau in many ways.  Sure, there are a few left field things that drop in from time to time, but most stuff that gets published fits neatly on the shelf next to other things published in the past 5-10 years.  Even where we do push, like Sign in Stranger for example, there are enough familiar elements that people can immediately jump on board.  Honestly, I don't think this plateau is going anywhere.  It's become its own style of play and there are now hundreds or thousands of people who dig it, such that games will continue to be produced for it.  But, in the future, I imagine there will be more innovative stuff and other plateaus.  How could there not be?

And so, people get used to taking rules from games, and not noticing them to be rules, just implementing them as they would "speaking for one's character", or "Adhere to the GM", as an approach.<br/><br/>Jonathan, I think besides the fact that it's hard to design something that is mostly innovative, and the fact that there is a market for the current designs, when you design something completely left-field there will be more work to sway people, and furthermore, unless you (as mentioned up-thread), make it very clear what behaviours/patterns are and (more importantly for "different") aren't part of the game and its requirements, you also have people less likely to grasp the game as you wished for it.<br/>In that regard, it may be better to have a design that's 90-95% known, and make small leaps, that will advance the field, slowly, rather than making a huge leap and falling short (though I think often other designers will take parts of your design and result in those 90-95% known).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154544/#Comment_154544" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T17:35:36+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  5:35PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marco</cite>Back in the day it was busted traditional games that didn't teach anyone how to play and had to be taught, handed down, from one viking hatted GM to another (oppressed newbie).<br/><br/>Everything old is new again.</blockquote>I wonder if the idea that these games are basically plug-and-play is largely a mythical construct.

Ron says it'll screw things up but he's a man who reads things one way--and only one way--and then applies a hell of a bias (if you apply SYORTD as a best-practice around player empowerment, which, I argue, it is, then it works just fine in Sorcerer and no one can tell me otherwise).<br/><br/>What it's about is a couple of things:<br/>1. A mania for "playing the game right." I have been, for the past year, playing games "as written" as an experiment and my conclusion is that indie or traditional, there is very little to be gained from it and a lot of ways it can hurt (no game was written for me, save one--and no game period was written for my group). I think this derives from a sense that many of the games (especially more indie games) are expected to be streamlined shark-like fun-engines. <br/><br/>See people bitterly complaining that IAWA 1st ed isn't as "tight" as DitV. There's no earthly reason to actually <i>complain</i> about this--but people do (newly released game doesn't meet arbitrary standard of perfection: <i>film at eleven</i>!!!1!!!eleven!!)<br/><br/>2. An identity politics stance wrapped around a meaning of quality (if you want to declare game A better than game B you need a textual deconstruction around play-experience derived from text).<br/><br/>Both of these are, clearly, hogwash.<br/><br/>I will use stakes setting in GURPS next time I play it and because I (mostly) understand what I am doing when I do so, it'll make the game better for it.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154559/#Comment_154559" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T19:04:07+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  7:04PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite><cite>Posted By: Marco</cite>Back in the day it was busted traditional games that didn't teach anyone how to play and had to be taught, handed down, from one viking hatted GM to another (oppressed newbie).<br/><br/>Everything old is new again.</blockquote>I wonder if the idea that these games are basically plug-and-play is largely a mythical construct.

Even worse: there were people happily playing Shadow of Yesterday--and playing it wrong (I, myself, have done that! Several times!).<br/><br/>I believe that for anything approximating a normal RPG experience (which IAWA and DitV and Sorcerer, for example, fall directly into) you will find there's a lot of fluidity to the experience.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154564/#Comment_154564" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T19:41:10+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  7:41PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2008 7:43PM by Moreno R..">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br/><br/>I had to fight with some of this: I started playing regularly forge-inspired games in early 2006, starting with DitV, and then trying a lot of other games. And sometimes (OK: often) I had to search for info in the net about how to play a game, because usually, they take it for granted.  There are some things take for granted in this culture (for example, how to frame scenes, or how to play well the adversity) that I have never seen well explained in any game book, they  are assumed to be already known. Because you followed a forum.  <br/><br/>Well, I follow at least three forums on indie gaming, and still sometimes don't know how to play some games. I have to ask. And people who play with me and don't follow any forums sometimes are a problem: we are playing, they do something really strange, I ask about it, they tell me that they did read it in the book, and I discover that, without the previous forum informations taken for granted, they misunderstood something written in the book.<br/><br/>So, it's not really strange that people keep porting ways of playing from a game to the next: they HAVE TO, to play a lot of games, and it's really assumed in a lot of texts. Then, obviously, this become a problem. Exactly as happened with "traditional" rpgs.  People find, after having to work to learn it, a way of playing that work with a game, and they tend to use it everywhere, and the hobby stagnate and innovative game get misunderstood as "unplayable". Exactly as happened with "traditional" rpgs. THIS specific lesson wasn't understood enough by many people.<br/><br/>But the fact than rpgs could be written much better, with better explanation of procedures, doesn't mean that everybody is the same from this point of view. I did play DitV, THEN I become interested in forum discussion about it. Not the other way around. Because DitV is explained very well...  to a player who already played traditional rpgs and is fed up with them. I was in that position, the game text talked to me, explained very well the play procedures, IN TERMS OF DIFFERENCE WITH THE GAME THAT I ALREADY DID KNOW, so I was able to play it. It would not be, I think, so useful in explaining the game to somebody who never played (too many talks about what GMs do in other games, and too many pages...),  but to me it was very clear, in explaining a different way of playing. GAME TEXTS CAN DO THAT. And should.<br/><br/>People get better at explaining games, too.  Matt, I understood how to play Dust Devils reading your second edition (and I did play it), but I had brought your first edition, too. And tried to play it, a couple of years before playing DitV. I didn't understand how to play it, and as a consequence, I played it in a very "traditional" way (with no idea whatsoever about what the job of the GM meant in the game, I even tried to railroad the "story"...) , and not only I didn't really play Dust Devils, but I didn't even notice that I did run it "wrong". I gave the blame to the game, sure that I played it right.  Then, after DitV, after reading a TON of forge posts, I played it again and this time it worked. Then I brought the second edition, and many things I had to read in the forums are in the rules this time.  Many people are getting much better at explaining their games (just compare Sorcerer with Spione...)<br/><br/>The problem, from my point of view, is that (1) still too many game authors don't care enough, or do care but believe people who play with them all the time when they say "it's clear already", and, worse (2) there is this sense (very well explained by Marco's post above mine [EDIT: in the two post above mine, he did post another before I finished writing this], that I disagree completely, because I already did try it for a lot of time and don't really work) that "you can't explain how to play a game in a rule book", something that I find really contrary to real-life experiences that say to me that you HAVE to explain how to play a game in the rulebook, and that is often only used as an excuse to not caring enough and dropping the blame to people who "are too tied to old way of thinking to play my game the way is to be played...  a way that I never explained, because it would have been useless, right?"<br/><br/>And, sometimes, I think there is too attention to innovative game design, but not enough to effective game WRITING.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154570/#Comment_154570" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T20:16:37+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  8:16PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't see anybody disagreeing with that, Moreno.

(2) Are the differences between them as big or bigger than the differences between indie games as a whole and trad games as a whole?  (3) How different from each other are various trad games?<br/><br/>My own answers, which may be wrong and are definitely subjective, are:<br/><br/>(1)  Very.  While many of them do follow, as Paul C. says, "Frame scenes--&gt;drive for conflict,--&gt;set stakes--&gt;resolve--&gt;adjust stats--&gt;and narrate", not all do (and there's a lot of leeway within each of those steps).  Plus, aside from that basic procedure, there are other mechanical differences that to me seem really fundamental.  The presence or absence of a central GM figure is my major bugaboo\u2014I've generally really enjoyed GM-less (whether that be "no GM" like in Shab Al-Hiri Roach, "rotating GM" as in 1,001 Nights, or "GM-ful" play as in Polaris) play in ways that I haven't enjoyed GM'd play.  And indie games are all over the map in that regard!  Which is awesome!<br/><br/>Please note:  I'm not trying to "win" the discussion or disprove Mike Holmes.  I think his comments are spot-on, in fact.  I'm simply trying to expand the discussion here.  The fact that there are lots of differences among these games does not mean that there isn't a story games culture.<br/><br/>(2)  Probably.  To choose really extreme examples: BW is farther from PTA than it is from D&amp;D, to be sure.<br/><br/>(3)  In my experience, which at this point is actually relatively limited, not much.  There's always a central GM, for one thing.  There is usually (always?) text that says the GM is always right no matter what.

To anyone? Really?<br/><br/>There's a design family tree which goes:<br/>"The Pool -&gt; InSpectres -&gt; Universalis -&gt; PTA -&gt; Bunch of stuff."<br/><br/>This is exactly <i>Frame scenes--&gt;drive for conflict,--&gt;set stakes--&gt;resolve--&gt;adjust stats--&gt;and narrate</i><br/><br/>It accounts for about (totally pulling this out of my butt) about half of indie game designs. Anything text at all which uses the word "narration" is a member of this lineage, as well as a lot of others.<br/><br/>It follows as natural as peanut butter from jelly that people who have played, say, three of these games will totally start assuming that this is how all games work (or should work), in particular because it's wholly portable to the traditional game of their choice without any fundamental mechanical changes, with generally positive results. (in fact, I have a recollection of a conversation with Ralph Mazza on the Forge, a long time ago, where he was trying to convince me that scene framing was necessarily portable to any system, and thus not itself a systematic element.) This leads them to apply it to whatever game they pick up, particular to whatever indie game because they think (with %50 accuracy) all indie games are like that.<br/><br/>I mean, let's see. It was GenCon 2006 when I had several Polaris demo-ers say, when we got to a conflict, "okay, let's set stakes!" I think that was the same con that Ron was decrying people taking stakes setting from one game and moving it to another, with the natural deleterious effects on games like Sorcerer and Polaris, but that could have been from the year after, I'm not sure. Is this any different from that? If so, how? What's changed since 2006?<br/><br/>If the problem is simply that people complained about IAWA and Poison'd because it did not meet their expectations of "indie game." But that has far more to do with the culture of entitlement created in the last two years than any problem of design. Given that this is Paul talking, I'm pretty darned confident that there's more to it than that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154586/#Comment_154586" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T21:36:12+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  9:36PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite><br/>And the evidence is that if you give a game like Universalis, My Life with Master, Sorcerer, etc., into a different culture (hardcore board gamers, perhaps?), that the games don't work as intended by the designer ("Wait, you played the whole game without roleplaying at all?").</blockquote>\nThis is not a bug.  It's a feature.<br/><br/>To announce my own bias, I'm a pretty strict textualist in most things, including games.  In short, the "intentions" of the designer are absolutely not relevant.<br/><br/>Transplanting games into different cultures has given us wonderful artifacts like the Samoans' version of cricket.  It's a great and wondrous thing.<br/><br/>Really, the whole line of thought just brings up visions of people standing on the sidelines, gnashing their teeth, staring and pointing and wailing "Noooo they're playing it <i>all wrong</i>" which I think is the last thing the Story Games culture is about.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154587/#Comment_154587" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T22:03:48+00:00" title="July  2, 2008 10:03PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>culture of entitlement created in the last two years</blockquote>\nBen, can you explain this comment, maybe in another thread?
