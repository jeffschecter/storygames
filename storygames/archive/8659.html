Comment from players encouraged...)<br/><br/>At Kapcon's Games on Demand, I facilitated three games: Moldvay D&amp;D by-the-book, Metal Opera, and Kill Puppies for Satan. All three were boy's clubs. This was unusual for me - it is rare that I run a game with only guys around the table (exception: D&amp;D, as will surprise no-one).<br/><br/>Kill Puppies was selected when the four people left needing a game were all facilitators: Aaron, Gregor and Simon. I was pleased but also somewhat intimidated, because KPFS has fascinated me thanks to the mythology that has grown up surrounding its play; and, I think, because of my gut feeling that there was something really strong in there, that KPFS is in its own way just as much a morality play as Dogs In The Vineyard.<br/><br/>Aaron's and Simon's protagonists were the classic broken youth of Kill Puppies, while Gregor opted for an older guy, 40-something and flatmate/Satanic mentor to the younger guys. I had each of them describe their "first kill" that delivered their starting Evil, and we were right into the unpleasantness, with a cat being drowned in a washbasin, a puppy being killed then cooked up and served to its owner, and (most memorably) a whale being dynamited in the blowhole.<br/><br/>Then I followed Vincent's advice in the annotations and just had the people who hated the characters come knocking. Specifically, the football jock boyfriend of Aaron's character's crush arrived with teammates to warn the freaks away. Instant violence broke out, and here I wonder that I was too lenient with how I set the attributes of the jocks, because the protagonists didn't have too much trouble holding their own physically. It seems more archetypal for the jocks to soundly beat the crap out the freaks, but the numbers I was picking as reasonable didn't deliver that outcome at all. Hmmm.<br/><br/>After that initial round of events, things spiralled out of control pretty quickly. Aaron's character ended up in police custody in hospital, burning all his Evil power to effect an escape. Simon's and Gregor's characters avoided those events, went shopping, caught a bus, and went to the zoo. There Simon's character brought his plan to a conclusion and poisoned a baby elephant. There was more running about as whale-lovers identified Gregor's character and chased him, and finally things spiralled back to where they began, with Simon's character burning all his Evil to gain a moment of romantic/sexual connection with Aaron's character's crush, and various other events happening that I can't even remember too clearly now.<br/><br/>The bits I remember best from this game, a few weeks on, were all to do with Simon's character. Simon was channelling the resentful, nasty worldview of a classic Kill Puppies punk, and his vitriol was forthcoming at the slightest provocation. I kept laying out setpieces for him to vent at, without even considering them. The security guard in the store and the checkout girl both received an earful; the little old lady needing a seat on the bus more so, and the guy who intervened to tell him to be polite came off worst of all. Every time Simon opened his mouth it was to issue forth the exact kind of invective you'd expect from such a damaged person. And it got to me a bit, because I knew people like that in my teenage years. They're pitiable, as they flail around damaging everything around them because they hate themselves so damn much.<br/><br/>So the GM decision I remember with the greatest clarity in this game, which otherwise pretty much ran itself with me just throwing in complications and responses to player-initiated actions, was deciding that Simon's character needed to have a scene with his mum. She had been off-camera the whole game but a few things had come through - that she was raising him alone, that she had a boyfriend, that she wasn't coping with him. I knew I couldn't let the game end without giving those two characters a moment. So as the game came close to time I had Simon's character's cellphone ring as his mother called him. Of course the call was answered, and the conversation that came next went far beyond black humour and was just straight-out black emotion. The way Simon portrayed the character's treatment of his mother was chilling, but it almost made sense of everything that had come before, not just in terms of Simon's characterization work, but in the game session as a whole. At the end of that scene I felt like I had got the moment I was seeking from this game.<br/><br/>We did a bit of debrief at the end, just talking about the events, reconnecting as human beings who weren't delusional little s.o.b's. There was a hell of a lot in the game that was funny, some of it downright hilarious, but the darkness at the character's hearts was impossible to escape and cast a shadow over everything.<br/><br/>I think this was the highlight of the con for me. It was a moment both disturbing and real, an intense emotional punch that I can still feel weeks afterwards. It wasn't fun, not in any sense of the word 'fun' that I can bring myself to use. But I'll say it was good. It was a good moment to experience. Still, I don't know that I'll ever play Kill Puppies again. I think that my reaction after the phone call scene was accurate - I've got what I was looking for, and it's not the kind of thing I particularly want a second time.<br/><br/>(Also: describing the death of the baby elephant by poison was really unnerving for me. I think I upset myself with it; I still have the visual of my description very clearly in my head.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191643/#Comment_191643" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T09:16:32+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  9:16AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds spectacular.

Simon said he wanted to be a bit more serious about it and I think both he and you found a serious tone in there. At times it went beyond biting comment, to really painful.<br/><br/>I felt you as a person got rattled a couple of times, like stiff punches to the soul. Once when we poisoned the baby elephant. It was tragic, the poor elephant flailed and its mother tried to help it - to no success - it was doomed. You drew yourself into more detail than you'd perhaps have wanted to in hindsight. This imaginary elephant, it doesn't exist, died and we all felt pretty bad as players. But as characters, well, it was popcorn-munchingly fun. And I felt the evil that Simon's character got for that was really deserved. What a prick! What had this elephant ever done, except be dreamed up by us?!<br/><br/>It was funny. I was trying to get Simon to do something like that to get Aaron's character out of jail. Instead, Simon used it to get Aaron's girl to show him some humanity for just a second. What a loser. Then the danger almost killed her while Aaron's character cut Simon's character's manhood off, or was it the other way round? The dice saved her in the end, which was fate I think.<br/><br/>In any case. The second time you got smacked in the jaw was that phone call. It was harsh. So harsh that you had the mum's boyfriend come on the phone to smack Simon down. If only. The vitriol got worse from his wastrel, and I think you were shattered when you eventually put the phone down to make his character stop. He was channelling something dark there.<br/><br/>I don't know what cesspool Simon dragged his character from, but it was pretty rough.<br/><br/>I felt that as bad as my character was, he wasn't a patch on the other two. I was this impotent dude who couldn't hold up his marriage and was going nowhere. His acts of evil were futile and almost comical. Funnily enough the game reflected that in that I got hardly any evil. The real bad mojo was flowing to Aaron's "all-in" asshole and Simon's callous and simmering shithead.<br/><br/>It was a good game, more serious than I've played it before, and more disturbing for that too. Maybe we should have stuck to the shallow end of the pool with this one? But then you wouldn't have got the elephant and the phone out of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191694/#Comment_191694" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T13:06:19+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  1:06PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for writing this Morgue.<br/><br/>I don't talk about this game that much, and when I do, I don't go into detail.  It's something I'm glad I experienced, but it's not something I want to dwell on.  I especially don't want to go over all the awful things Slick (my character) did.<br/><br/>I totally get what you mean, Morgue, that this was disturbing because it was a little too close to home.  Slick wasn't me, but he was worryingly close to some people I've known, and I think really what he represented was a potential version of me - what might have been.  That's really scary to me.  I think Gregor is right in some ways that I was channeling something dark.<br/><br/>I think the other characters worked well to counterpoint Slick though, and I don't think we would have had the same game.  We got flashes of humanity from Gregor's character when we visited his ex-wife's home, and Aaron's character's sad crush on the girl.<br/><br/>I'm right with you in thinking that it was the phone call that was the pivotal moment for Slick.  I think that's when we saw his pain, and the awfulness that he was inflicting on himself,come to the surface.  We saw the source of all that raw hatred, and it was all the worse for being so mundane.<br/><br/>I don't know that I'd play KPFS again.  I might run it, but I feel like I've got what the game has to give.  Not neccesarily what I wanted, but what the game brought out.  It's not something I want to revisit.  It's certainly the game I'm going to remember most from that con, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191847/#Comment_191847" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T09:14:41+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  9:14AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, this all reminds me of a My Life with Master game I ran once. It was totally disturbing to the core. MLwM is a little different than kpfs, perhaps, in that the players dream up this evil Master, but then the GM plays it to the hilt. In kpfs, the GM works to give the players an opportunity to be evil. But there are enough similarities to warrant discussion.<br/><br/>I think these games can be so world-shaking for us because they make us examine parts of our humanity that we don't like. I'm not saying that we ARE these characters we create, or that they're somehow parts of us. These evil creations are within the realms of our imagination, however, and that we can comprehend and role-play them can be pretty shocking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
