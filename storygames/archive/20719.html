We all have assumptions (I call then "conventions") about roleplaying games; about what a (roleplaying) game should be to be called a roleplaying game; about how roleplaying games are played; about the roles in roleplaying game groups; about what a roleplaying game should include.<br/><br/>I will now copy-paste bits from two blog posts. Here is the first one from <a href="https://yarukizerogames.com/2012/12/12/the-assumptions/" rel="nofollow">Yaruki Zero Games</a>. While reading this below, take time and think about what this assumption brings to the session and to the game-play, and what would happen if you broke it or how you could replace it with something else. <i>Lots of examples of games that break these assumptions</i> can be found in the blog post.<br/><br/><i>You Don\u2019t Need to Explain Stuff<br/></i><blockquote>"There\u2019s a ton of stuff in RPGs that\u2019s left unsaid, and which people expect to be left unsaid."</blockquote>\n<i>RPGs Must Use (Standard) Dice<br/></i><blockquote>"/.../ The key issue with using cards and diceless games is that they don\u2019t work well when you just slot them into the standard action resolution paradigm in place of dice."</blockquote>\n<i>Player-Created Characters<br/></i><blockquote>"One of the cool things about playing an RPG is that you get to make your own character and have him or her go on crazy adventures."</blockquote>\n<i>RPGs Need an Omnipotent Game Master<br/></i><blockquote>"There is utility and power in having an old-school GM role, but it just isn\u2019t the only way to apportion participants\u2019 roles in an RPG."</blockquote>\n<i>RPGs are About Action-Adventure Stuff<br/></i><blockquote>"By and large the medium has been limited to action-adventure (with some horror thrown in) in various milieus."</blockquote>\n<i>RPGs Must Have Speculative Fiction Elements<br/></i><blockquote>"If you bring up the mere possibility of a game that doesn\u2019t involve wizards or superpowers or spaceships, some gamers will act like you\u2019re asking them to play a game about an office worker staring at a blank wall for 8 hours."</blockquote>\n<i>Immersion is the Highest form of Role-Playing<br/></i><blockquote>"There are RPGs where the GM makes you feel like you are your character interacting with a world."</blockquote>\n<i>RPGs Must be Long-Term</i><blockquote>" /.../ The need for long-term play in turn dovetails into a need to stick to a single game,"</blockquote>\n<i>Anything New Must be a Total Game-Changer</i><blockquote>"Whenever we try to do something new or unconventional with RPGs, there\u2019s the question of where to go from there."</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455150/#Comment_455150" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-18T13:03:43+00:00" title="July 18, 2016  1:03PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2016 7:12PM by Rickard.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another blog post, <a href="http://urverkspel.com/artiklar/141-ett-urval-av-rollspelens-konventioner" rel="nofollow">this time mine</a>.

I definitely don't run things as described in THE SCENARIO, and I'd probably be bored in a game where things were run that way. I also think it's interesting how nearly all THE SCENARIO assumptions conflict with "I know only what my PC knows." \u2013 they're metafictional, so any influence they have on a player's decision-making goes beyond what their PC knows. Like a protagonist in a slasher film cavorting around the woods alone in the middle of the night because they know that their less wholesome friends will be offed first.<br/><br/>"My thoughts and feelings is nothing someone else should hear." makes me sad.<br/><br/>"We sleep upstairs in the tavern." makes me smile. I like the old-school D&amp;D expectation that PCs will establish a home base of some sort and even enlist personnel, instead of being total insular itinerants.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley" title="Simonpaulburley"><img alt="Simonpaulburley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/525/nEVIULR78FJ45.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley">Simonpaulburley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455703/#Comment_455703" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-20T17:20:28+00:00" title="August 20, 2016  5:20PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "The Game Master should sit at the short side of the table"<br/><br/>So there should be two people close to the game master and then everyone else should get progressively further away, eh?<br/><br/>The game master should sit in the middle of the long side of the table with the players as far as possible equidistant. If there are players who are quieter then an excuse should be found to sit them either side of the GM. (Unless it's their preference to just sit quietly and watch.) If there is a player, or two, who tend to be louder, enthusiastic and contributive - they need to be sat away from the GM.<br/><br/>IMHO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455712/#Comment_455712" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-22T03:13:00+00:00" title="August 22, 2016  3:13AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The GM should pace around the outside of the table and the players should be forbidden to look directly at them.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455715/#Comment_455715" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-22T11:36:07+00:00" title="August 22, 2016 11:36AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tannoy system.
