What RPGs have systems that successfully model political intrigue type situations (think Varys or Littlefinger in GoT)? What are some specific system elements that shine; for example; social combat mechanics, multitudinous factions, negotiation mechanics, NPCs that have their own goals, etc. Also, what could make the system better? Or what haven't you seen that you would like to see?

It would be interesting, I think, to create a game where most of the moves available to you (or, at least, the ones you want to be using!) need you to act indirectly - influence allies or enemies, create indirect pressures, and so forth. You can sway a person to support Alice instead of Geoff, but you can't confront Geoff directly, for whatever reason.<br/><br/>After all, I think intrigue requires three things:<br/><br/>1. A relationship web of multiple parties and factions who cannot simply go separate ways. They are, in some way, interdependent.<br/><br/>2. A need for secrecy - your motives cannot be made public for some reason. For instance, a powerful overseer or power (the King, in many medieval intrigue stories) does not wish any individual below him to gain too much power.<br/><br/>3. That indirect methods are more effective or less risky than direct methods.<br/><br/>Intrigue generally exists in complex social situations where direct solutions are not allowed or frowned upon, forcing people to act "behind the scenes".<br/><br/>For example, being a relatively physically "weak" individual or faction and trying to enact change against stronger factions or individuals may force you to seek indirect means.<br/><br/>This could be a matter of playing women in a primitive society where "might makes right", but only men are allowed to bear arms, for instance. Create an interdependent group of people and then give some people strong aims they cannot immediately achieve, and you will quite naturally give birth to some intrigue.<br/><br/>The hardest part about handling intrigue in an RPG, I think, is figuring out how to handle all the "behind-the-scenes" elements. We can't have everything happening "on-screen"... so how do we keep track of, and then resolve, all of these elements?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456039/#Comment_456039" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-04T19:39:35+00:00" title="September  4, 2016  7:39PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was looking for something just like this!

He can now leverage that desire, combined with her irrationality, to get her to do things, while giving only the flimsiest justifications for why.<br/><br/>Not that his justifications aren't delivered with aplomb!  Tantalizing promises, hinted threats, pledges of love, claims of forces outside his control, and lots of personal charm.<br/><br/>Wanting to be near the seat of power, but not having any highborn excuses to do so, Baelish looks for a place where the highborn cross paths with the lowborn, and seizes upon a brothel as the perfect opportunity.  Here he will get some personal info, and maybe some personal dirt, on the leaders of the realm.  His pitch to them is absolute circumspection, never letting on that keeping their secrets is itself a form of power.<br/><br/>Having some genuine skill at accounting, and at identifying opportunities for profit, Baelish does very well for himself as brothel-master.  When the realm's position of Master of Coin becomes open, he presents as a logical candidate:<br/>- makes huge money in his own business<br/>- vouched for by Lysa Arryn and by all the local nobles whose sexual secrets he's kept<br/>- diplomatic speaker, should be able to negotiate with various factions<br/>- not allied with any particular major faction who the crown wouldn't want to give power to, won't create appearance of favoritism or power consolidation<br/>- seems deferential and should obey the crown's orders<br/><br/>Once you're Master of Coin, you're in pretty good shape to make powerful allies and lackeys.  You control who gets taxed and who gets subsidized!  Anticipating that a power struggle may be decided by the local security forces, Baelish makes sure to pay them well and get on their good side.<br/><br/>Baelish invests his increased wealth and power in an information network.  Eventually, he's as well-informed as anyone in the game.<br/><br/>Aware that Robert Baratheon is a crappy administrator who relies on his Hand, John Arryn, to keep the kingdom intact... and aware that Arryn is on track to expose the king's "son" as a bastard, and his wife as a traitor, thus paving the way for a simple end to that matter... Baelish seizes the opportunity to destabilize the realm and to keep an illegitimate heir on track for the throne (which will aid future destabilization when the truth emerges in some fashion) by removing John Arryn, which he does by calling in his Lysa Arryn asset.<br/><br/>Having told Lysa that he would now be hers, Baelish now has to keep her pacified with regular contact and excuses why he hasn't joined her yet.  He continues the manipulation expertly.<br/><br/>When the chaos eventually erupts, Baelish uses his sway over the security forces to determine the winner of the first clash, putting an accused-but-not-proven bastard on the throne to be challenged by the king's brothers and other claimants.  The Lannisters appreciate Baelish taking their side, and award him a promotion to John Arryn's vacant position as Warden of the East.<br/><br/>*****END OF SPOILERS*****<br/><br/>Looks to me like the relevant personal skills are:<br/>- conceiving possible opportunities and hunting for them<br/>- recognizing opportunities that come your way<br/>- charm<br/>- seduction, manipulation, lying<br/>- diplomacy, negotiation<br/>- reading people<br/>- organization and management - keeping up many simultaneous ventures<br/>- accounting<br/>- entrepreneurship<br/>- memory (for all that info he collects)<br/><br/>That "spotting opportunities" stuff can be further specified as spotting:<br/>- the winning side<br/>- weak people (gullible, lonely, slightly insane, etc.)<br/>- fragile systems<br/>- weak points in systems or relationships<br/>- useful people to pursue allegiance with<br/>- access to that which is otherwise out of reach<br/>- vulnerabilities or gaps in that which is otherwise protected<br/>- present or future openings in powerful positions<br/>- brewing crises<br/>- information sources<br/>- opportunities to create leverage<br/>- ways to apply leverage which will work<br/><br/>Some of that may be redundant with "reading people".<br/><br/>Food for systems thought, hopefully!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456046/#Comment_456046" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-04T23:52:10+00:00" title="September  4, 2016 11:52PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great analysis, David!

All the PCs and major NPCs were on it, color coded and clustered according to their approximate spheres, with the standard lines-plus-words between circled names to indicate a relationship of some sort. So in the upper left to middle were all the nobility in blue, in the bottom left were the priesthood in red, and the nobles who were more tightly connected to religion were in the bottom left of the Noble area. When things changed we updated the map. This helped keep track, remind us when we e.g. hadn't played with the mages for a while, served as a nice record of some statuses like when someone died they stayed on the map but got little X's for eyes.<br/><br/>It's Burning Wheel, so there were few player-level secrets. Not "you don't know the Prince's agenda at all" instead "prince wants to get out of arranged marriage and is currently lying that it's peachy to not upset the wealthy potential uncle-in-law, what do you do?" Dunno how well a giant public relationship map would work in a player-secret-intrigue game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456058/#Comment_456058" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-05T18:36:51+00:00" title="September  5, 2016  6:36PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 6, 2016 6:02PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, I like this idea.

What are the emotional rewards of intrigue?<br/><br/>- empowerment fantasy: castrated (literally or metaphorically) characters using their brains to overcome humungous odds. David vs a whole society of Goliaths. <br/><br/>- excitement: in a royal court/presidental office/whatever, family squabbles and work relationships like the ones we all live out every day have epic consequences, a ripple-out effect on the lives of millions.<br/><br/>- amorality: it's tiring worrying about being a good person all the time, so it's relaxing to indulge in characters who give zero shits about this (this one might be just me?)<br/><br/>- secret sharing: people like being next to power looking out, rather than outside looking in as we normally are in real life. that's why Underwood addresses the audience directly.<br/><br/>- sex: it's unusual for a intrigue story not to involve a bit of seduction. i suppose it's not inherent to intrigue itself, but we might as well embrace it.<br/><br/>What others? I'm wiped for now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459599/#Comment_459599" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-25T18:55:57+00:00" title="January 25, 2017  6:55PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/empowermint">@empowermint</a>,<br/><br/>That's a good list! An interesting take on this.<br/><br/>I would add that one of the interests of intrigue which is missing from your list (and, in particular, the one that is generally not addressed by RPGs) is the vicarious challenge and thrill of participating in the intrigue itself. Bluffing, lying, relying on people's honesty, seeing through someone's deceptions, and so forth.<br/><br/>This is hard to do between *characters*, but can be done between *players*. (e.g. the board game Diplomacy, or any bluffing game, even something like Poker) However, it tends to distract from the story/roleplaying aspects of the game.<br/><br/>If there are particularly good ways to make this happen between *characters*?

For the Story game the problem isn't completely flushed out, but I think I  pretty much have a solution for the RPG side.  However, I've become much more interested in producing a story game version of my game. This is the problem I've been working on ever since I started designing my game. Once I finish my write up of my GoT-like Story Game [currently titled: House of Spiders], I will let everybody in on them. (Paul, if you wanted to discuss this stuff privately; I would share my ideas with you now regarding making this happen between characters in the story game or RPG whenever you want to talk.  And you could tell me about the holes in my ideas and what I didn't account for, haha <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> It would probably be best to talk live being that is a big subject and we take some time to discuss <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )<br/><br/>Anyway, I would love to have this discussion in full. There are a lot of ideas that I'm sure I haven't thought of and I'm willing to contribute a lot to the subject; like I said, I just want to get my write-up out there first, so they can be given proper context <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Maybe, I will get a short, truncated  write-up done by Friday evening, (I fear if I don't just do a short write up, it will take forever, being that I  have very little time and promised one probably a month ago) and, even if it doesn't cover all aspects of my game in full, it will give people an idea of the direction I'm going and some idea of how I think this problem can be dealt with.
