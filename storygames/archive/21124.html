Personally, I mostly use the thesaurus that comes with the macOS dictionary. There are some useful online dictionaries with a thesaurus, too.<br/><br/>So, a thesaurus is the most indispensable tool for me when I'm tweaking the basic terminology of a new system. I go over many iterations of changing basic words like "bonus, trait, flow, technique, mechanic, flaw, vice, conquence, result, relationship, connection, suspense, volatility, power, strength, asset..." etc until I find just the right word.<br/><br/>In my experience, the right terminology makes a huge difference in a games' consistency and accessibility. So I wanted to share this experience and ask in return if and how you value a thesaurus in your own design process?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463206/#Comment_463206" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-09T21:23:19+00:00" title="May  9, 2017  9:23PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like to joke (in that it's a true thing that I say in a way that's meant to defy expectations for the sake of amusement) that when I'm translating I spend far more time with my head buried in a thesaurus than I do in a  J-E dictionary.

System makes a huge difference, and sometimes using the old terminology makes people think a new game is just the same old game they understand and have always played.<br/><br/>There have been many times I\u2019ve facilitated Collaborative Story Games at Story Games SLC and the group has just ignored my discription of the game\u2019s unique rules and system features and has just played it the same way they\u2019ve become accustomed to playing. Why play a new game everyweek if we aren\u2019t going to actually play the game the way it was designed to be played? <br/><br/>People sometimes say, they don\u2019t like being told how to play a game. I say, if you don\u2019t like a designer to tell you how to play their game, don\u2019t play their game. But don\u2019t play a game in a way it wasn\u2019t designed to be played and then blame the game when things don\u2019t work out. I think using the unique language at least gets the reader to pause and hopefully notice that games are different and that they need to play a game as it is designed, on its own terms, to really experience it.<br/><br/>That said, if a game mechanic is essentially  carbon copied from game to game, and there is a precise, well known term for it, another term doesn\u2019t seem very useful. I think this is much more the case in mainstream games than in indie ones though. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468656/#Comment_468656" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-30T10:24:07+00:00" title="December 30, 2017 10:24AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I think using the unique language at least gets the reader to pause and hopefully notice that games are different and that they need to play a game as it is designed, on its own terms, to really experience it.</p></div></blockquote>\nSpot on, Jeff!<br/><br/>I also like differentiating between games by using different physical components - as in, this is the game where we use both index cards and a bag of white and red stones, that's the game where we use tarot cards but leave out the suit of Wands. These surface differences activate different neural patterns or yadda yadda yadda stuff, I think.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>That said, if a game mechanic is essentially  carbon copied from game to game, and there is a precise, well known term for it, another term doesn\u2019t seem very useful.

That has become pretty much a standard for a few specific things, such as the X-card (and Lines and Veils before that).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468659/#Comment_468659" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-30T15:10:06+00:00" title="December 30, 2017  3:10PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu" rel="nofollow">Rafu</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>...if players take turns framing a scene in your game, by all means call it "players take turns framing a scene", not "Game-Directors introduce Action-Segments in accordance with the Wheel of Karma"...<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nHaha, for sure <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caroline_Hobbs" title="Caroline_Hobbs"><img alt="Caroline_Hobbs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/121/nILD1Q33E03N4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caroline_Hobbs">Caroline_Hobbs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468683/#Comment_468683" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-01T01:30:22+00:00" title="January  1, 2018  1:30AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man I get trapped in Thesaurus Purgatory real, real bad.
