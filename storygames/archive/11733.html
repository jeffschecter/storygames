Accordingly, I remember smartguns, skinweave, monowire, and the chip you could plug into your head to remold your facial contours.  It was intended for switching identities, but I used it to make a horned, mask-like demon face.<br/><br/>The other game feature I remember was the rolled histories.

The Lifepath Generator. I never played Traveller, so I don;t know how it compares to the liufepath system n that game, but I've modded the C2020 lifepath system to plenty of other systems and settings over the years. It was (and still is) a great way to add story hooks into characters that are otherwise fairly one dimensional, and it provides some funs twists into characters where the player is willing to let things fall into the hands of fate.<br/><br/>2. Cyberpsychosis. A great precursor to the "humanity" system found in so many other games. This is the kind of thing that I found a missing factor in later games like RIFTS; full conversion cybernetics, drugs that pushed a body to superhuman levels, genetic exploitation, magical sacrifice to demonic/supernatural beings....none of which had psychological effects on the character except in a few notable character class exceptions (ie. The "crazy"). Cyberpunk actually made you think about the psychology.<br/><br/>3. A damage system that wasn't really a hit point system. Everyone basically had the same number of hit points, in the same way that everyone's body is basically made up of the same stuff. Differences in damage resilience came through damage reduction armour and innate endurance/ability to withstand the effects of the incoming damage. It's not really that revolutionary now, but I'd never seen anything like it when I first read the book.<br/><br/>I also thought it was better than Shadowrun because it didn't rely on non-human characters or magic to get it's style across, everything was scientifically plausible for the future (or at least we thought it was at the time).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261891/#Comment_261891" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-14T09:02:16+00:00" title="March 14, 2010  9:02AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since we're branching out from Cyberpunk 2020 to Shadowrun, people always forget that Rifts -- being a fellow child of the 80s -- was built on a cyberpunk-inspired foundation, at least in the corebook, before heading off into crazyland.

Along side D&amp;D;, Pendragon, Top Secret SI, and various homebrews it probably got more play time then anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe'd do mini-campaigns that would wind up being 6-12 sessions around a theme.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did the Trauma Team game where they were basically the EMT equivalent of a Gypsy Cab.  They'd hack into the rescue calles from TTI and REO meatwagon and then try to beat them to the scene.  Each session was basically an armed extraction of "ok, how do we get this guy out of this crazy jam, a) before he dies, b) before they die, c) before the real EMT's show up and start shooting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also did a Max Headroom takeoff where they'd fly around as an investigative news team.  The sessions looked really similar to our EMT game with just a different MacGuffin<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did a Rockerboy one too where everyone played two characters, Band member and Roadies, with the Nomad Driver and the Solo Body guard and the like.  That one didn't last very long, I think we only had 2 sessions of actual play but we'd spent a ton of time on "play before you play" talking about the characters and the cool stuff we were GOING to do with them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261921/#Comment_261921" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-14T11:53:48+00:00" title="March 14, 2010 11:53AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            what I remember (and always liked) about Cyberpunk is the injustice<br>\n<br>\nthe world was unfair, and made you do fucked up things to survive or reach your goals                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261928/#Comment_261928" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-14T13:40:32+00:00" title="March 14, 2010  1:40PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Cyberpunk: REO Meatwagon<br>Shadowrun: Doc Wagon<br><br>Essentially the same services in both game settings.</br></br></br></blockquote>\nAnd their over-the-top cousin from SLA Industries, LAD (Life After Death).

But having thought about it some more I'll get a little more meta.<br/><br/>Whatever the rules of Cyberpunk either contributed to or worked against in he genre it attempted to emulate, it both fed my natural inclinations and prepared me for the kind of gaming I most often preferred, both then and now.<br/><br/>The text/attitude of Cyberpunk 2020 absolutely helped create the kinds of games that worked well for its players.<br/><br/>I don't mind as a player strong, nigh insurmountable opposition as long as my character concept is allowed to prevail.  In Cyberpunk 2020 you most often faced implacable power.  The game was rigged against you.  Your patron was just as likely to fuck you over as pay you off.<br/><br/>But through it all you were fucking cool.  Whether you were a mirror-shaded Rockerboy, a connected Fixer or a cybered up half-human Solo.<br/><br/>Maybe things went pear-shaped and maybe you got headshot on the verge of some kind of transitory material success.  But you went down in slow-motion and with your nihilistic outlook snarling into the maw of the Man.<br/><br/>So you didn't mind so much.<br/><br/>And, realizing that, you may have figured out that, for yourself at least, character and story were at least as important as shiny power-ups and getting to the next level.<br/><br/>That's what I remember about Cyberpunk 2020 and that's what I'm thankful for about it; it refined for me what I want most often wanted from this hobby.<br/><br/>For the most part, it wasn't until later later than I found systems that also provided systemic help in supporting these preferences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261959/#Comment_261959" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-14T18:53:46+00:00" title="March 14, 2010  6:53PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, I don't remember the insurance part.

The high concept was that the PCs were all fairly important people who had been cryo-frozen a few decades ago. Like one dude was a scientist who had pioneered the technology for The Net. <br/><br/>Someone or something had woken them up but the process had gone all wrong. First adventure, they realize that two factions are fighting over their sleepy selves, and they decide to kick some ass and go with neither party. They sneak off into the city and try to live on their own, but the culture shock is too much. We spend some time exploring SIN (secure identification numbers) and public-private key encryption schemes. Without a SIN, no one can have money, use mass transit, pass secure checkpoints, etc. They soon find the black market for organ donors and realize a dark potential. Whenever they kill someone (and the harsh world gives them all kinds of excuses to cap people who make a move on them), they take the bodies to illegal organ harvesters, who pay them insultingly low amounts of credit on debit cards. They take their debit cards to convenience stores, where they can buy and microwave food. After a couple cycles of this, they start measuring people in burritos. "Dude, don't shoot the head. He was worth 10 burritos. Now he's worth only 4." There was a subplot about starting a small electronics business, too.<br/><br/>The game died after a couple sessions because I'd made a critical mistake of letting everyone make up a "farm" of multiple characters. Managing that many characters was too much. There wasn't enough continuity to keep people's interest. They seemed to have a blast when engaged with a single character, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262246/#Comment_262246" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T09:01:37+00:00" title="March 16, 2010  9:01AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, that's a great way of teaching the setting too!<br/><br/>This is a great thread for a great game.

You play the gang members -- perhaps artificially thrown together by the producers, but maybe you're legit. There's an embedded camera crew with you. They probably get smoked a lot, but hey, life on the street is molten, muthafucka, so don't take the job if you can't hack it. The tv show follows your life as you try to survive. Only, you know, nothing's pure. The producers fuck with you. And there are corporate sponsorships. Coca-Cola sponsors your gang. You get big bonuses when you recycle the Pepsi-sponsored gangers. Your jackets and guns have Coke logos on them. The Real Thing, muthafucka. You're hyper aware of your ratings. When your ratings fall, the producers get the shakes, and shit comes down on you, or you lose your sponsorships. When your ratings soar, life is sly and you score ill bennies. You do everything you can to keep the ratings up.

I feel like one of the biggest losses in American literature is that "The sky was the color of a television tuned to a dead channel" now makes people say "what, the sky was blue?"  <br/><br/>A lot of the stuff in cyberpunk, as with any science fiction, looking back, made bad predictions. The rapid development of the cellphone and the AOL-ization of the Internet into something essentially harmless and neutered makes cyberpunk's anxieties seem outdated.  We happily threw our privacy in the garbage for ten percent off on our supermarket discount cards. Japan didn't come over here and acid rain actually turned out to be something people cared enough about to work on.  Cyberpunk's anxieties turned out to be partly groundless and partly trivially true.  Nevertheless I still love it, for many reasons.<br/><br/>First of all, I loved what I perceived as its roots in noir.  Cyberpunk heroes were outsiders and losers. The system was rigged against them, the deck was stacked, the world was corrupt and innocence and goodness was rare at best and often illusory.  I could draw a straight line from Raymond Chandler through to William Gibson.  By the by, I was and am a huge Gibson fan.<br/><br/>Because I'd grown up voraciously reading science fiction, the exact trappings of cyberpunk, or its exact borders, I knew it was futile to ever chase that kind of thing down. Besides, Gibson's short story collection Burning Chrome had so many different varieties of story that I was never as hung up on "oh this novel doesn't have some kind of Net in it, it can't be cyberpunk" as some people undoubtedly were.  The cyberpunk "scene" passed me by.  I knew it "only" as literature (as if that wasn't enough.)<br/><br/>The first semi-cyberpunkish roleplaying thing I was aware of was Shadowrun. I have to say I never got it.  If there was one thing that didn't seem to fit with the noir, corrupt world of cyberpunk it was elves-and-trolls-and-spellcasting fantasy.  I just flat never had any interest in it.  I liked the human detective archetype, who even eschewed cyberware and replaced it more or less with a fedora and a typewriter font narration balloon above his head.  People I played Shadowrun with even got a little annoyed at me because of how little I would engage with most of the game elements.  When it's all about spells and big guns, who wants some asshole to sit in the game saying "It was all because of the girl, wasn't it? You thought you had her under wraps but <i>she wanted a slice of the cake.</i>"  Bah, nobody.<br/><br/>Anyway, so Cyberpunk 2020.  I first really got involved in the 2020 edition, not in any earlier ones.  The main thing that struck me about it as being interesting was the wide variety of roles and the equally wide variety of game situations the roles envisioned. That seemed to me to be a lot more interesting than being a shadowrunner and a shadowrunner only.  The GM's advice even suggested things like Trauma Teams and bands and journalists as central elements to organize a campaign around.  In fact, one of my first campaigns was about two shadowrunners who were also in a band.  Keeping track of their girlfriends became a big part of the campaign.  <br/><br/>More soon, about the challenges of bringing what I loved about cyberpunk literature to the gaming table and why I never felt like I quite nailed the target.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262559/#Comment_262559" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T13:38:26+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  1:38PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember the part of FNFF where suppressive fire resulted in a saving throw, not a bunch of attack rolls.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now let me be clear. I liked the missions of Cyberpunk 2020. I got it. The big boys have a problem, you're a loser with guns and a need for money, they will pay you to figure out and handle the situation and that way they have deniability, because if anyone comes after you, you'll be crushed so fast that nobody will ever figure out who put that money in your pocket.  Sweet.  And I did several games like that.<br/><br/>I also did games where you were still a loser with guns and a need for money but you had a <i>plan</i> of your own - either you were a medic on a Trauma Team or you were a crummy no-rent entrepreneur trying to become one of the big boys, or a nomad family, or a journalist, or whatever.  This helped out a lot because the characters had goals of their own and were self starting.  The plots became more personal, it really mattered if someone stepped on you because it stopped you from getting what you wanted, not the big boys that had hired you.  <br/><br/>But still, I didn't feel like I was really capturing the cyberpunk sf or noir feel.  For one thing, none of those were power fantasies, none of them were about characters reaching their goals, the core cyberpunk stories, I felt, were tragedies, often romantic tragedies, but tragedies nonetheless.  I already knew I hated when books and comics introduced a character, made you care about them just to kill them off, but I LOVED Shakespearean and classical tragedies in which the natural arc of the character landed them inevitably in a horrendous place.  That was the same kind of tragic arc that you would see in noir or cyberpunk, and what distinguished the protagonists from the other characters was that the protagonists knew it would end horrible.<br/><br/>Now, I wasn't the only one that saw this.  CP2020 was the one that went to Walter John Williams and got him to help write a HardWired supplement and to George Alec Effinger and got him to help write a When Gravity Fails supplements. They did what very few genre adaptations have done since then - try to be literary rather than cinematic, and do so by going to the original authors.  But even in those supplements, the authors were more concerned with bringing what they had created to the roleplaying experience rather than bringing the experience closer to what they created.  (Williams' HardWired was actually a bit more technothriller-y in structure than cyberpunk-y, so it wasn't a long trip.)  Particularly the When Gravity Fails supplement was disappointing to me, not because what was presented was bad - the Budayeen is so wonderful I could run 101 Nights worth of games there, hint hint, but because what was in the novel was so exactly cyberpunk, so exactly noir that I was disappointed not to see more of it there, especially in the GM advice section.  Audran literally becomes the killer he's chasing (through cybernetic personality implantation) in order to survive, and it destroys him.  That's awesome - where is that story in CP2020?<br/><br/>I also used CP2020 for comedy - as you can see, it's ripe for satire even within the source material, they are making funny commentary on our consumer culture.  This was greatly enhanced in Cybergeneration, the underappreciated semi-sequel to Cyberpunk that used a stripped down system and anime stylings to get across a "teen superhero adventure" attitude.  The Repo Man campaign I described above is part of this.<br/><br/>Anyway, I have always wanted to go back to cyberpunk gaming because although its specific anxieties are very 80s, and it was unbelievably prescient in terms of how much and how quickly corporatism has beaten us in terms of privacy and security, the story is still compelling.  Noir is a creation of the late 40s and early 50s' anxieties about the Bomb and the horrors of World War 2 still reverberating around the world, yet it remains relevant today because it speaks to feelings and desires that are human and present in every day and age. I see cyberpunk the same way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262790/#Comment_262790" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T11:58:44+00:00" title="March 18, 2010 11:58AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for bring up that noir feel of Cyberpunk.

HardWired actually being one that springs to mind. And who can forget "what you have to do to be technical"? The combat is really not the issue. It's the motivation and endpoint that needed work. Actually one of my favorite mission-oriented CP2020 games I ran involved crappy mercs that needed money, and I insisted that every job was going to give them enough money to retire somewhere wonderful, and we started every story arc with how all their dreams had fallen apart since the last payday, but THIS one was going to give them hope.  It was more effective than just accumulating more gadgets, not because the gadgets are bad (and they did accumulate them!) but because everyone at the table knew that when they win they're going to lose again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

That totally fits with the idea that the church is a super powerful, awesome thing but yet totally evil and corrupt, which reflects the mixed feelings punk has about power and authority.

There wouldn't stop being religious assholes, they'd just be these fragmented lunacies built on the ruins of old belief.  <br/><br/>The few exceptions that I remember to this were mostly based around "those mystical religions of the east" -- where long after the west had either outgrown or killed its religions, the "philosophical ways of being" of the eastern world would endure. Sometimes this combined with the cult thing to get scary asian cults, and other times it was a bit more attempting-to-be-positive-but-just-being-orientalist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263016/#Comment_263016" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-19T14:12:47+00:00" title="March 19, 2010  2:12PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's been a while, but I remember some tongue-in-cheek pokes at organized religion in either Gibson or Stephenson.

Look for a bunch of kids with stupid hair on handbuilt bicycles now.</p>\n<p>In the <a href="http://www.comicvine.com/eppy-thatcher/29-28992/" rel="nofollow">fourth Grendel</a>, the American Catholic Church (which was terribly fond of Saint Elvis) was a massive, world-destroying entity that could only be defeated by the drug-addled, trickster genius of Eppy Thatcher. Like most good art, it doesn't precisely fit the genre, but it's all about human corruption as evidenced in the Church and police. For an American comic, it had remarkably British sensibilities in that regard. It really worked for me as a 15 -year-old. (The previous series was violent personal romantic tragedy and the subsequent series was about political power. It was nice to have a comic grow up at the same rate I did.)</p>\n<p>There was another, much less-well known (ha!) comic called Fringe that had this conglomerated, commercialized religion with sexy nuns in the Sin-A-Gog.</p>\n<p>I don't recall ever using that in gaming, though, and I don't recall much about it in any Cyberpunk book. I'd bet that, on some level, RPG publishers didn't want to tangle with the forces of real religion, since that fight had gone so badly just a decade earlier.</p>\n<p>(I think a lot of science fiction has pointedly disregarded religion. Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov both sort of assumed it would just go away as people became more rational. Both were blind to what functional religion does and how it works. In <em>3001</em>, the fourth book in a series about God, Clarke finally says, kind of baffledly, that people still have religion, though it's a deist thing, and not at all the Church of England or Catholic Church that he assumes all religion is in the 20th century. That kind of unexamined perspective on religion sort of saturated SF since then, I think. Only Herbert sticks out in my mind as having something interesting to say about it, and his religions are really unpleasant (to fit the rest of his unpleasant institutions).)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263097/#Comment_263097" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-20T09:18:35+00:00" title="March 20, 2010  9:18AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You guys are totally right about "Eastern religion" and Herbert being some of the stand-out examples.

There was some truly fantastic art in there, stuff that set the stage in my head for what the game world was like, with bullet holes in walls and clothing always cut at odd angles.  I remember Mr. Stud's implant and giggling.  I remember Humanity rules and loving the idea of a rule that told me how psychologically damaged my character was becoming through self-modification.  I remember loving the core mechanic deeply, a mechanic that I still love. I adored the baked-in situation that came with the Lifepath system.  <br/><br/>What I probably loved most though was the parts where the game setting, with it's crazy cyberpunk science and sociopathic take on violence, met with things that felt more real and tangible to me.  <br/><br/>In other words, I loved Cops.  <br/><br/>I'm going to go on for a couple of minutes here.  Wax nostalgic.  None of this is going to be good AP, just ideas and good memories.  <br/><br/>I ran a cop campaign set in Night City based on the TV series Homicide: Life on the Streets.  The players all played cops, though not necessarily with that role, and they were all detectives for the Violent Crimes Division.  They were murder police in the world capitol of murder.  I partnered them up randomly, and gave each set of partners a case to work.  When players weren't investigating a crime during a scene, I would ask them to play some NPC or another.  <br/><br/>I don't remember many of the cases that the cops worked.  One of them was about a warehouse burned down by an arsonist, a couple of Nomads killed inside of it.  I remember coming down on the PCs as their Lieutenant about red-ball cases and trying to get a good clear percentage.  I remember stealing most of a line out of the Homicide book and using it as the opening line of the campaign:<br/><br/>"The phone made a bleating sound like a goat.

For example, you could take 1940-1950, and depending on where you were in the world, it would be a very different game, and it could be about completely different things. Transhuman Space was the same. I don't think I'd ever play just Transhuman Space, but I could totally do cops vs crime syndicates in the 22nd century using Transhuman Space. I could also do vampires vs werewolves in the 22nd century using Transhuman Space. I even had the inclination to do a JAGS Wonderland/Transhuman Space hack. It was incredibly boring in terms of lacking purpose, and Centauri Knights had that going too, although a bit less as it was implicit that you were an explorer, but it really gives you the option to do anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263215/#Comment_263215" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-21T07:22:56+00:00" title="March 21, 2010  7:22AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a Verge game I ran, someone invented the Sony Praystation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

A game that didn't give you that stuff as game pieces and rules \u2014 instead just pouring it out onto the floor with compendious details about how Tommy guns work and how much damage they do, then telling you to sort through it \u2014\xa0would not be a very good game.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263225/#Comment_263225" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-21T09:15:44+00:00" title="March 21, 2010  9:15AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, generic games like GURPS more than perhaps any other RPG are a game design toolkits by design.

I could take A Dirty World as the system, and play a 22nd century murder mystery. It would hit the spot much better than a 22nd century murder mystery with GURPS. I have no clue for sure if GUMSHOE were actually better for that too, but that would be another option. I could take Millenium's End or The Babylon Project (or both together) and play a 22nd century techno thriller, and thanks to the overlays, the combat would seem better than with GURPS. As far as a game about diplomacy goes, you'd need a system that handles that, most likely designed for modern or historical diplomacy, and use THS as the backdrop for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Where was the subtle and gameable diplomatic system as detailed as the combat system? I was given a precise modifier to determine how much more or less amenable an individual was to being convinced, but no way to establish a base value that didn't rely overmuch on IQ (which I wound up breaking out into a bunch of substats) and HT (which you have to hack to make work interspecially, or everyone's most attracted to blue whales).</p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong: some good stuff happened.

Once the characters are created hosing them because they did what the rules encouraged just seems, well, unfun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AJohandsome" title="AJohandsome"><img alt="AJohandsome" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AJohandsome">AJohandsome</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328984/#Comment_328984" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-10T09:16:43+00:00" title="June 10, 2011  9:16AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing I remember the best of all the Cyberpunk 2020 rules and setting stuff is the rule for guns locking up when you fire the damn things. <br/>\n<br/>\nSee, we misread the rules. In our initial runs of the game (and when I say initial, I mean about a year's worth of 3 weekly sessions), we operated with a draconic gunlock rule - you had to roll to see if the gun locked EVERY time you fired. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis had a couple of effects; <br/>\n- Mexican stand-offs were a really hardcore, nerve-y thing to engage in. <br/>\n- Firing your gun became a less important part of the game (alternatives; bluffing, intimidation, etc. Oh, and grenades. Loads of grenades)<br/>\n- When the forces of the large corporations were after you, hunting you down, tracking you, your gun was unreliable. Even your gear fucked with you, in addition to the fact that your contacts sold you out to the highest bidder, ex girlfriends kicked you out, and you were left in a coffin hotel, sweating and trying to use what little med skills you had to patch up that leg you took a knife in. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt all built up around this desolate feel of the setting that I really dig. Nothing goes the way of the PCs, yet by pure luck (at times) and some skill, we usually managed to push through. You know, apart from the occasional shot to the head by random gun-toting NPCs. <br/>\n<br/>\nLater we realised that we'd misread the rules, obviously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11733/the-part-of-cyberpunk-2020-that-i-remember" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11733/the-part-of-cyberpunk-2020-that-i-remember" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11733/the-part-of-cyberpunk-2020-that-i-remember/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11733%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11733%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
