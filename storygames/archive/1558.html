Or, the GM and the players could have given some of their chips to her at a +5 bonus to her roll for each chip given. Or maybe +10? If she rolled lucky, she could keep the chips she didn't use and save them for another roll later on, or give them to other players who are doing something cool. Finally, if she didn't use the chips at all, she could cash them in for extra XP at the end of the session.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>

                            Most D&amp;D variants that include some sort of fortune point take a page form the handling of Force points, and make them a scalable number of d6 (such as 1d6 for level 1-5, 2d6 for levels 6-10 and so on) which are added to a d20 roll.  Alternatives include rolling an additional d20 and keeping the better one, or simply allowing a reroll.<br/><br/>The sole point I would raise is the same issue with 7th Seas' Drama dice, which you could roll as bonuses _or_ keep as XP.  The problem was that it was cool and fun to spend them, but it was smarter to hoard them.  That resulted in less fun, so I would either decouple them from XP or change it so spent tokens translate into group XP.  As an example, for every X tokens (where X equals the number of players) spent, grant the <i>group</i> one standard reward (the XP for an encounter with a CR of their level).  This means that _everyone_ benefits from the funniest guy at the table.<br/><br/>Additionally, if you want something a little less PTA but still dramatic, Chris Aylott's "Dynasties &amp; Demagogues" includes feats which are rather like TSOY's keys (though some are even more meta).  When a situation comes up, or the character (or player) does something in particular, they get an action point.  The model is limited, as it was written to not upset the apple cart, but if a player of GM is comfortable with the idea, it's easily extendable.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            I wouldn't want extra dice to roll as that doesn't give a defined level of help "You gave me an extra d6 but all it gave me was a 1!" I've seen additional d20s (shadowing, it was called), I'm not sure about it for what I was thinking, anyway. Maybe I should have said this in the original post:<br/><br/>"What the GM should do when she/he sees an action that everyone thinks is cool is give out a bonus to the roll or lower the DC of the challenge," was my original thought. But, I'd want more input than that. I love TSOY's chip usage, but what could be done for D&amp;D (if anyone wanted to help D&amp;D)?<br/><br/>I see what you mean about giving group XP, but would that lead to unloading chips at the end of the session to cash in on the XP whether the action was cool or not?<br/><br/>Hmm, my first thought about transferring chips/tokens back to the GM to use is that it would alter the simplicity inherent in the PTA system. The blog post does describe how it could be done for multiple options back at the players. I like that. I love letting the players know how much stuff villains have left before they're tapped.                        </div>

<p>Well, er.</p>
<p>Why on earth would anyone who understands the system choose to do that? It's incomprehensible to me that someone would choose to introduce noise into a really strong and clear signalling system, in exchange for <em>playing less.</em> (Because, you are aware, d20 is not open-ended.) That's an unambiguously terrible idea.</p>

I first saw it in the d20 AEG supplement 'Good' as Action Dice. AEG later also used it in a more refined form in Spycraft. Is Star Wars the original version of this for d20? They were 'exploding' dice that everyone got only so many of, but issued at the beginning (or by GM/group concensus when something amazing happened), by the GM, with a couple of different ways to spend them - roll to add the result to an attack or skill roll, spend n dice to auto-confirm a critical threat roll, etc.<br/><br/>We used them in that form in my most recent long-running Dnd3.5 game. One player described them as 'like cheating, but better!'. We didn't have any 'cash-in' rule, it was use them or lose them, which helped pacing - everybody made sure they had a few to use in the big fight and almost all of them got used every session to do awesome stunts that wouldn't have been attempted otherwise. <br/><br/>So yeah, use'm, love'm.                        </div>

                            I'm planning on basically welding Fanmail onto my Over the Edge game, starting this week in fact. In OTE the GM awards "Experience dice" which can be saved up and spent to improve traits, or spent one by one to add to a roll. I plan to start awarding them on the spot instead of end-of-session, AND passing out "Gift Dice" to players to  award as they wil.<br/><br/>To Shreyas' comment: You're quite right that in theory this tactic <i>does</i> mean playing less. In my personal experience, however, leveling has been slow enough that Level 20 looks like an unattainable mountain, completely outside the realm of practical possibility. Even level 10 seems a long way off. Mileage may vary, and I know there are some groups that DO level faster, or start higher, or both. But for a slow-leveling group, the prospect of "I'll get to my NEXT cool feat/spell/class ability that much faster" easily outweighs "Oh, but when we hit 20, we'll have to stop."<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>
