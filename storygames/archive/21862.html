                    This is a follow-up to <a href="/forums/profile/Jeph">@Jeph</a> 's threads and <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> 's continuation:<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21103/the-spicy-dice-roll-salvaging-something-coherent" rel="nofollow">The Spicy Dice Roll: salvaging something coherent</a><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21132/spicy-agenda-and-principles" rel="nofollow">Spicy Agenda and Principles</a><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21139/the-spicy-roll-agenda-player-edition" rel="nofollow">The Spicy Roll/Agenda, Player Edition</a><br/><br/>Feel free to read those or not, but the gist is that we're talking about a very specific play style which intentionally and successfully includes a lot of GM control over outcomes.  And yet, there is also a lot of dice rolling!<br/><br/>This discussion started from the Forge Actual Play reports of <a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">@Silmenume</a> (aka Jay), who recently discovered Story-Games.com.  Good to see you again, Jay!<br/><br/>Jay and I started chatting about how, in this style of play, the fact that <i>dice influence but do not determine outcomes</i> is a key component.  Rather than providing a final answer to a difficult question that the group wants answered for them, the dice provide an ingredient (such as a "1" or a "20") which the group incorporates into the common ground which informs their collective meaning-making improv.  It's as if the group assembled to play jazz, started with a standard, found their own voice and their own take on that standard, and are now parsing that "1" or "20" relative to that subjective endeavor.<br/><br/>So, if you're doing an epic, heroic riff on Lord of the Rings, your Dunedain Ranger is not going to be impaled on a "1".  But, if you're doing a dark and grim riff on Lord of the Rings, your itinerant dwarf might well be impaled on a "1".  Not that the broad strokes tell the full story!  The group will surely find different ways to play GrimDark LotR Jazz over time, and the question of <i>what's meaningful in the moment</i> is inherent subjective and situational.  So maybe your downtrodden dwarf's "1" is a survivable part of our introduction to their ongoing run of foul luck in life, while the ranger hero's "1" arrives at the end of a long duel against a balrog, providing a death worthy of ballads.<br/><br/>I think this summary hits the key points of Jay's current thoughts on the matter -- perhaps he can correct me.<br/><br/>Personally, I very much like the idea of formalizing this process a little more.  I don't want to minimize the prominence of the in-the-moment judgment of the participants, but I would like some ways to communicate "how we use the dice" more succinctly.<br/><br/>My first thought is this:<br/>1) Whenever a player attempts something and is invested in an outcome which, to them, seems uncertain, ask the GM either, "Does it work?" or "What happens?"<br/>2) The GM will then reply with the range of possible outcomes.  For example, "That's a crapshoot; could go either way!" or "Unfortunately your opponent seems more skilled than you expected" or "No problem, piece of cake."<br/>3) The player will then roll a die to narrow that range down into a specific outcome.  For "crapshoot", a high roll could mean great success and a low roll could mean total failure.  For "surprisingly skilled opponent", a high roll could mean you fend them off long enough to escape, and a low roll could mean you get horribly wounded.  For "no problem" a high roll could mean complete success with bonus positive consequences, and a low roll could mean an embarrassing botch and hilarious setback.<br/><br/>Other thoughts welcome!                </div>

                            This thread confuses me a bit. The title seems to be asking "When should you ignore the dice?" or maybe "When should you not roll the dice?" but the "first thought" you pose at the end seems to offer a dice system (not super removed from the one in Blades in the Dark, in that it uses positions to determine how bad things can go) that doesn't answer either of those questions?  I guess you are advocating for "We shouldn't ignore the dice, we should build a dice system that we don't have to ignore" which is cool, but... old news?<br/><br/>I mean, I LIKE the idea of a system where you have Favorable/Even/Unfavorable conditions that determine the range of outcomes your die roll can generate, and maybe even some sort of "control" factor that tells you how big a random range to generate, but it seems a little...tangential to the original question?                        </div>

                            Oh, and this one : the die is a wand, and shoots things, good or bad or moot. The players and GM don't know at any given time if it will fire something significant, but they need the constant flow of results. When the flames begin, the GM will try to redirect the energy at something. Solid scenario achievement ? Making the PC look cool ? Anchoring the PC in the setting with a long term perk ? Informing the GM of the dimensions of play that can be useful there could be a tool, for "nudging".<br/> </div>

I don't think that's what this is though.  Lasers &amp; Feelings doesn't have explicit rules for much of anything, so you're not really disregarding anything when your setback is "The transporter beams you down in the middle of the gladiatorial arena" instead of "The transporter disassembles your molecules and puts them back together wrong and you die."                        </div>

                            I agree with <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> that formulating the procedures of 'spicy roll' style would be very fruitful. I have tried to simulate it in a very handdriven Swords Without Master game, it was okayish, and I want to become better at it.<br/><br/>How I see it is that there are two parallel spheres. One is basically playing a game of chance with d20 (ir has a nice spread) and another is a collaborative storytelling. The two are not as strictly intervowen as in OSR or indie games. I would say the game of chance part informs the narrative but nothing more. The game is exciting because sonetimes you roll a 1 or a 20, and because rarely you roll a 20 when it is very crucial to roll one!<br/><br/>I think it is hard fun, because you need players who are eager to and can ride two parallel animals at the same time: a rollercoster and a boat on a river.                        </div>

It doesn't seem fruitful to include "disregard the rules" in the definition for this technique. Who wants to use a technique that requires you to use a rules system that's unsuited for it? This thread is about finding procedures to do this on purpose, no?<br/><br/>I think it's exactly the thing that I do in L&amp;F (and have done in other games, too). You use dice, but they don't really decide the real stakes, whether you succeed or fail, but rather they color the scene with some varnish of success or failure, while still proceeding forward with the adventure. Isn't that what we're talking about?                        </div>

Except that was 100% what the "Spicy Die Roll" thing was, so I feel like it's relevant.  If the rule system ALREADY does the thing, we're not really accomplishing anything here?

Okay, now I disagree entirely. L&amp;F provides hard rules for success/failure, and you gave no indication that you were ignoring them.                        </div>

                            I think the Middle Earth RPG group using the Spicy Die procedure developed a system of spoken and unspoken house rules.  Chunks of published rules were used where they accorded with the group's system.  Nothing too uncommon among traditional RPG culture.<br/><br/>"The rules" exist, but they are not in the Middle Earth RPG book, they're in the group's shared understanding.  And in some of Jay's AP summaries.<br/><br/>Personally, I am interested in reproducing this sort of play with a text more concise than Jay's AP summaries.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

I grant that I'm not too familiar with the background (I vaguely remember reading parts of the "Spicy Die Roll" thread), so perhaps I'm way off here. But the OP text in this thread talks about "a very specific play style which intentionally and successfully includes a lot of GM control over outcomes."<br/><br/>I'm just not clear on what we could discuss if it's not how to play a game in which the dice influence but do not determine outcomes. Does this play style necessitate choosing a rules system to explicitly ignore? Or is it a case of illusionism, where you claim to follow a rules system but secretly don't? What purpose do the rules serve in this play style if you're not following them, and why can't you write rules that encourage the play style?
<blockquote class="Quote"><blockquote class="Quote"><br/>I think it's exactly the thing that I do in L&amp;F (and have done in other games, too). You use dice, but they don't really decide the real stakes, whether you succeed or fail, but rather they color the scene with some varnish of success or failure, while still proceeding forward with the adventure. Isn't that what we're talking about?</blockquote>
Okay, now I disagree entirely. L&amp;F provides hard rules for success/failure, and you gave no indication that you were ignoring them.</blockquote>
It's a matter of degree, perhaps, and I'm not sure how much I'm going off the rules here. Sure, if they roll a failure, I let them fail the action and get some negative consequences, but I make sure they are still fully capable to continue the mission. There are setbacks, but they won't really ever fail the adventure. Compare this with Apocalypse World, where a failed roll really is failed and can cause the plot to veer off in a completely new direction. In (my way of running) L&amp;F, the dice rolls affect the way the scenario plays out, but don't really decide the important parts. If they fail a roll against the bad guy, that will not mean Zorgon wins. It'll mean something horrible happens and now it's EVEN MORE important that they finish this other roll.<br/><br/>Maybe not the same thing, but I feel it's related. Basically, I think what I'm talking about is very much this stuff:
<blockquote class="Quote">So maybe your downtrodden dwarf's "1" is a survivable part of our introduction to their ongoing run of foul luck in life, while the ranger hero's "1" arrives at the end of a long duel against a balrog, providing a death worthy of ballads.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="Quote">The player will then roll a die to narrow that range down into a specific outcome. For "crapshoot", a high roll could mean great success and a low roll could mean total failure. For "surprisingly skilled opponent", a high roll could mean you fend them off long enough to escape, and a low roll could mean you get horribly wounded. For "no problem" a high roll could mean complete success with bonus positive consequences, and a low roll could mean an embarrassing botch and hilarious setback.</blockquote> </div>

                            Isn't a big part of the player-facing "system" actually meant to make them believe they have more control than they actually do? Sort of (if you'll forgive this really unflattering analogy) one of those toddlers' toys that has a bunch of colorful buttons to push and knobs to spin, but they don't actually do anything besides entertain the child.<br/><br/>Whereas the GM-facing system is basically about turning yourself into a black box that can convert various ephemera (like which do-nothing buttons and knobs the players fiddle with) into the story you want to tell? That's less a system than it is a skill to be learned--entertaining, storytelling, social manipulation.<br/><br/>I'll admit, I have a hard time taking the Spicy Die seriously. I think people want there to be more going on than there is; that's equally descriptive of people who want to suss out "the real system", and a description of the buy-in necessary for people to enjoy playing it.<br/><br/>The oracle isn't talking to the gods, she's just a woman in a cave making shit up. If the entire country hinges on her word, it doesn't make the gods any more real, it just means that she's running a really good grift.<br/><br/>The dice don't determine the results, they modulate tension and expectations. But it doesn't work if you hand people a set of rules that say, "Your job as a player is to get really excited when a high number comes up and quiver with dread after a low one."                        </div>

Your job as a player is instead to participate in the process of making something meaningful out of the fictional ingredients at hand.  The number a die shows after you roll it is one of those ingredients, but never the most important one.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most important aspects of this play style, for both learning and teaching, have nothing to do with the dice at all?  I do still think the particular niche for the dice is interesting, though.                        </div>

                            The closest thing I can see to this mechanic that's not straight-up illusionism would be something like the Burning Wheel chance die or OSR "judgment rolls" where the GM might say something like: <br/><br/> "Hey, I don't have prep that tells me whether or not there's a pile of straw at the bottom of this barn to catch your outlaw as they jump from the hayloft. Let's roll this d6 to find out. 1-2 says there's no straw and you're hitting hard earth, 3-4 says there's enough straw to cushion your fall and you'll take half damage, 5-6 means it's cushy enough that you don't take any damage." <br/><br/>I suppose you could probably put "special-effects dice" from games like Dragon Age in this category as well, where they don't determine what happens but influence it obliquely (by granting you stunt points, or momentum, or what have you that can influence future rolls). Branching out from that, you could have a system wherein one die is used to determine the tone of the narration that must accompany the action, but not it's results. So say in a game about regret and bad decisions: <br/><br/>1: Reminds me of a simpler time. <br/>2: I didn't mean to...<br/>3: I knew it was a bad idea, and I did it anyway <br/>4: Once bitten, twice shy. <br/>5: Blinded by sentimentality <br/>6: Giving in to my worst impulses. <br/><br/>The results of the action could be determined using another system, one that perhaps is influenced by the results of the "tone" die. Maybe characters who acted blinded by their sentimentality gain a penalty forward to act callously and advantage to the next purely selfless action they take. In a game all about selfish action, that could have interesting repercussions. <br/><br/>Otherwise, what you're talking about is pretty much pure illusionism where the GM uses whatever comes up on the dice as justification to make stuff up without rules or principles to guide them. And that's the distinction I think between something like Pbta games, where the degree of consequence from a 6- is widely variable but it's written in stone that there *must* be a consequence and that you as GM need to be acting according to the principles put forward by the game's rules. So it would be against the principles of an AW game for the result of a 6- on a gunlugger's attempt to kill the Hardholder's lover resulting in the end of the universe (barring an incredibly byzantine series of prior events that led up to all of existence resting upon the life of a nomad's boy-toy). <br/><br/>Likewise with any standard OSR sandbox play, where the rulings a GM makes over say a roll to determine if there's something nearby a character that they can use as a useful improvised weapon might change from session to session or scene to scene but what a roll means (at least in general terms) is established prior to resolving the question. Rather than rolling and then determining what it means afterwards. Going back to the outlaw jumping down from a hayloft and wondering if there's going to be something to cushion their fall example, that ruling might never be used the same way again but the general procedure of setting expectations as to what the various results mean and then following through on them will be obeyed. And as part of the principles of OSR play, there is an understanding that what is possible based on this roll is going to flow from the GM's prep and what's been established through play. <br/><br/>And to be clear I'm not talking about games like Fiasco, where great latitude is given to the player narrating as to what's acceptable to add to the fiction, but they must abide by the results of the black or white dice that they've gained. Latitude in narration isn't the issue here, it's about whether the rules and procedures of a game have weight behind them and impact play. Functional illusionist play relies on everyone being at least somewhat aware that the GM is the sole creator of all of the important content, and everyone else is just elaborating on it. It's awfully hard to program "the dice aren't really important, unless they are, in which case they really are" into the text of a game. I would argue that it's self-defeating. <br/><br/>Although that's coming from the perspective of someone who thinks illusionist play is more or less a betrayal of the purpose of RPGs. So I might be a wee bit biased on that count.                         </div>

                            Part of the reason I'd like to codify "spicy die" play in written form is to clarify that it <i>isn't</i> "GM makes stuff up without principles to guide them".  (In fact, I think it's possible that the unwritten principles which guide Spicy Die GMs play a much larger role in shaping play than the written principles which guide most PbtA GMs!)  Unfortunately, these principles emerge from the group's unique take (e.g. grimdark/heroic) on their specific material (e.g. LotR), so couldn't have been written down beforehand, at least not precisely.<br/><br/>So here's an idea:<br/><br/>Perhaps after each session, the group could brainstorm ways to describe what they just did.  And then the parts everyone's enthused about get written down.  And then next session, everyone revisits that written list, and whichever items still muster consensus enthusiasm become Agenda or Principles.

That I can see and appreciate. Formalized tools for saying "this is what I dig, let's aim play towards that". to be honest, that sounds kind of like the ongoing conversations embedded in Blades in the Dark about whether something constitutes a Controlled or Risky situation, what sort of consequences can be avoided vs. reduced, and what Great Effect on a roll to Skirmish with a trio of master swordsmen means exactly. <br/><br/>So what I'm saying is that I think a system that easily adjusts to generate the sort of outcomes (and therefore the sorts of stories) that people at the table want to see is the secret sauce here. Not necessarily resolution that's disconnected from outcomes. <br/><br/>In the game used as an example of Spicy Play, it sounds as if the dice were more or less used as a prop and not really consulted in any meaningful way.  It strikes me as possible that this happened mostly because the rules as written wouldn't deliver the sort of fiction they were looking for.<br/><br/> I'm reminded of the original LOTR roleplaying game that gave massive benefits for wearing lots of armor and gave orcs a ton of HP and then said in the same breath "But seriously guys, just have the Orcs fall over after a good hit. Oh, and discourage characters from using lots of armor. It's not in the spirit of the books. But characters shouldn't really get severely injured anyways unless it's a climatic scene." <br/><br/>You know, stuff that probably should have been written into the game's system. Or more in keeping with the ideas I expressed above, have been included as considerations as part of a flexible set of mechanics that could be applied in different ways based on group consensus. Like: <br/><br/>Slain<br/>The character is slain, if this is their Last Stand or they have fallen to the Shadow. Otherwise, they are presumed dead only to reappear later, or captured by the Enemy. <br/><br/>Which of these will happen should emerge over time as a result of conversation between people around the table. A grim saga of the last of the Rangers defending a ruined stronghold makes every fight a Last Stand. A frolicksome tale about some hobbits that trick a goblin king out of his treasure might ensure that no fight is a Last Stand. Hobbitses are not made for fighting, precious. <br/><br/>That's just an example, but that's the sort of thing I mean.                         </div>

                            Hello,<br/><br/>lots of interesting things said in this thread so far but too many to comment on at this point so I'll focus on the one just previous by johnthedm7000.  Before I begin my dissertation (right back at you David!  Yes I am self-acknowledgedly verbose - hence "dissertation" <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ) I want to bring forward a few very important ideas that have yet to be discussed.<br/><br/>First, for this type of non-deterministic dice mechanic to flourish the DM cannot be running a pre-established story.  It follows if the dice are not deterministic then the DM cannot have a (pre)determined story.  One must support the other.  That's the whole idea of coherent game design and play, yes?  That the game "system" support the goal of play? I'll get back to that in a moment.  This doesn't mean the DM can't prepare for the game session but this preparation is NOT destiny.  Nor do this mean that the DM is entirely passive.  They are actually quite active pushing things around keeping events interesting (and spicy) just not towards a specific preordained end. <br/><br/>Second, and this follows the first, this non-deterministic "mechanic" does not support long term parties for the simple reason that in time each character will have their own goals that will develop over that they would like to pursue.  How does this follow?  Because as we are creating and making decisions over time the character motivations and goals (or even character death - or perhaps choosing to sail to the utmost West in Middle Earth) will diverge...and they should.<br/><br/>Third, as a corollary to the above, this modality of play can lends itself to players having multiple characters all in the same world...and they should be varied and unequal.  The simple reason for this is that each character has a different perspective and leads to a different gaming experience.  The various characters add contrast to the world help keeping it fresh and growing.  IOW it helps keep the game experience from getting stale.<br/><br/>While the bottom two are not strictly necessary (but I believe important, YMMV) the first absolutely vital.  So we come to johnthedm7000's concern - 
<blockquote>Otherwise, what you're talking about is pretty much pure illusionism where the GM uses whatever comes up on the dice as justification to make stuff up without rules or principles to <b>guide</b> them.</blockquote>
While it is possible for the DM to abuse the role in the game it does not necessary follow.  It's not the non-deterministic resolution mechanic that deprotagonizes player agency rather the true villain is the absolutely lethal idea that the "DM <b>tells</b> a story."  Aside from those rare but apparently awesome instances <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17311/the-beautifully-railroaded-game-did-you-do-it/p1" rel="nofollow">The Beautifully Railroaded Game: Did you do it?</a> where a given story was <b>going to happen</b> I believe the paradigm of "DM tells a story" should be shot, drawn &amp; quatered, burned and the ashes thrown to the 4 corners of the earth.<br/><br/>I play in a "spicy dice" game that has been running for 40 years and I've had the privilege of playing for last 21 years of it.  The game IS <i>intense</i>! I've seen people cry at the table many times.  One time an ongoing battle was so boisterous that riot police were called! I do not make this up.  I've seen players driven to rage (me not to long ago) or bleakest blues.  I've seen players given up beloved characters to save an NPC and I've seen betrayals that left everyone in stunned speechlessness.  About 35 years ago a player whose character (a Dunedain) had been chasing down a vision when the last 3,000 Dunedain alive in the world were being systematically destroyed to last man, woman and child was in tears begging the DM to let him die with his people.<br/><br/>How does this relate to quote above...the GM used the "spicy dice" mechanic" through all these years and events.  Johnthedm7000 I disagree that deterministic mechanics prevents illusionism.  D&amp;D5e is a glaring example of books worth of mechanics that leave the players virtually no meaningful input at all.  Point in fact I believe deterministic mechanics are orthogonal to (for lack of a better term, I hate it but I'll use it for now) Simulationist play.  It believe this is so because I believe that Sim play is what I call "Semiotic Jazz".<br/><br/><i>Semiotics</i> because at the end of the day we are human beings sitting together having a conversation - albeit a very stylized and ritualized one.  We roleplay/play story games because we want the experience to be meaningful.  Be that meaning having a good time or experiencing a world or riding an emotional rollercoaster - or all maybe all the above.  All this happens with signs and symbols (spoken language, gestures small and large, maps, photos, etc) which result in meaning creation but new signs and symbols which have other meanings and so on.  These created meanings are meaningful to us because WE created them through of process of investment.  We care about what we create and what we sometimes lose because of this investment.<br/><br/><i>Jazz</i> because I believe that the meaning creation process is mediated in a way that is very, very similar to how jazz works.  The analogy is that the standard is the source material that everyone at the table wants to play.  Like jazz it's not enough that the player have an academic knowledge of the "standard" they have to be invested in it.  The player needs to be moved by it in some way because lots of creative decisions will need to be made, informed by it, over the session ON THE FLY.  Right now!  The "melody musicians" play chords that are informed by the melody.   I believe these "chords" are the thematic elements of the "standard/source work" that we players including the DM resonate with. (No pun intended).  These choice of what chords to use are not perfect and are subject to much interpretation.  Yet the choices of what chords to play is just random but strongly informed and constrained by Music Theory, either explicitly or implicitly.  Then we get to the soloists who then "riff" on the Standard.  This I equate to the actual play of the players at the table.  In jazz, as in roleplay, the choice of what tones/notes to play are not random but fairly constrained by the "standard/source material", what has been played in the past, the choice of chords, music theory, the overall group aesthetic, the individual player's aesthetic, the instrument the player is employing, etc.  While the play is "improvisational" it is most certainly NOT free form and it definitely is not played off of sheet music.  It is somewhere in between.  <br/><br/>This "riffing" is highly informed, leans strongly on theory but is most not deterministic.  Hence my position the "Simulationist" play is neither illusionistic or well served by deterministic resolution mechanics.  No sheet music/no DM "telling a story."  What happens when a die rolled is called by is actually part of the "riffing" process.  Properly employed it becomes part of semiotic signification process - its meaning changing from instant to instant depending on the moment in the here and now as well as everything that has ever happened in the past (that can be brought to bear).                        </div>

                            The point of the die roll is not to determine if something happens the way you want it but rather add to the drama/meaning/excitement of what you are trying to do - <i>right now</i>!  The die rolling mechanic can be used to mean anything within the constraints of all that I mentioned above.  In the game I play the die roll is also used ritualistically to indicate that the game has officially begun. "Everyone roll...", and off we go.  The die used in this fashion cannot be used deterministically because it is impossible to cover all possible events that might arise in any game.<br/><br/>So if the die isn't used for task resolution what does it say about the style of play?  Used in the "jazzy" method I described it says that we are all involved (implicitly) in what that die roll <i>means</i>.  Sim is about creating and having an aesthetically pleasing/meaningful experience.  The die roll is to support that group aesthetic - however that aesthetic is informed.<br/><br/>I've gone on too much and not covered what I really needed to say, but such is way I write.  David knows.  Apologies to all.<br/><br/>Best.                        </div>

                            What I'm wondering is how specifically you determine what the die roll means in your manner of play? Is it established before the roll? After the roll? By whom? How does it add to the excitement of the group? <br/><br/>Or to put it more simply: what's the mechanic here? When is it determined that dice are rolled and what is their purpose in being brought out? Imagine a new player showed up to your game and was eager to play but unversed in your group's dynamic and needed to be taught how to play. <br/><br/>Specifically how would you answer these questions:<br/><br/>1. So...when do I roll the die?<br/><br/>2. Is there anything we have to talk about before rolling the die? <br/><br/>3. What does rolling the die mean for me and my character(s)? <br/><br/>4. How do we interpret the results of the die? <br/><br/>I've re-read your posts three times and I still can't for the life of me see the answer to any of these. I desperately want to understand this, as it's completely alien to my experiences with RPGs. As I see it, mechanics (no matter what sort of mechanics they are) are there to drive interesting play. You say that the procedures you've set up in your game do that. <br/><br/>What I'm asking is "How?" <br/><br/><br/> </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/johnthedm7000">@johnthedm7000</a> I'm not sure that answers to your 4 questions will carry any meaning without first embracing the context in which the die is rolled.  It is <i>not</i> rolled as what you're referring to as a "mechanic".  The Spicy Die roll is not a resolution mechanic at all.  It's a randomized input procedure, nudging the fiction ever so slightly toward or away from character success.  <i>No one</i> at the table imagines that the die makes <i>most</i> of that determination; it's just a nudge.  <br/><br/><i>Usually</i>.  <br/><br/>Part of the excitement (or in some cases probably <i>all</i> of the excitement) is the chance of rolling a "1" or a "20" which lead to outlier outcomes.                        </div>

                            I guess part of the GM's procedures need to include the directive that enough die rolls need to be called for to make it statistically likely that a 1 or a 20 will show up with the necessary frequency.<br/><br/>I suppose that could explain why some approaches favor involved, drawn-out combat procedures. You're bound to get some of "exciting" results if you're throwing dozens of d20s over a typical combat, compared to just compressing combat resolution into a single die-roll like many other tasks often are.<br/><br/>Would that make D&amp;D 4E-style skill challenges a kind of spicification of non-combat task resolution?<br/><br/>Edit to Add:<br/>Or, put another way, can we infer anything about the Spicy Die by looking at the ways other systems use their die rolls as overt regulators of tension? Is the OSR imperative to "reduce the reliance on die rolls, because statistically they are probably weighted against you" bland play, or maybe a reaction to the dice mechanics not hitting the "sweet spot" of meaningful extreme results? Does the progressive tension-building of Dread mirror the Spicy Die inasmuch as tower falls are an "inevitability" the longer you go without one? Dread seems to be a more clearly codified example of a spicy game.                        </div>

At the GM's discretion, with the GM advised to call for the dice for these reasons:
<ul>
<li><b>Tempo: </b>It's about the right time for there to be a <i>chance</i> of something unexpected happening.</li>
<li><b>Uncertainty: </b>Either the players believe, or the GM knows, that there are a bunch of meaningly different possible outcomes here.</li>
<li><b>Disclaim Responsibility: </b>You want to leave the answer to a question up to chance. You want the answer to not <i>entirely</i> be "your fault".</li>
<li><b>Fish for License: </b>You've got something big you want to happen! But it's jarring, and weakens your authority, to just say that it happens, out of the blue. People are more willing to accept something big and unexpected after a particularly good or bad roll. So call for a roll mostly to have a chance for an extremely high or low result to grant you the license to do your big thing!</li>
<li><b>Signal: </b>To communicate that something important is happening in game. "Roll initiative", or, "Roll perception."</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/johnthedm7000" rel="nofollow">johnthedm7000</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>2. Is there anything we have to talk about before rolling the die?</p></div></blockquote>
No, but there are a couple of things we <i>might</i> talk about.<br/><br/>The way the GM interprets the die roll depends on what is normal, expected, likely, or default—according to some weighted combination of the GM's private knowledge (she is the Source of Truth for the shared imagined space, after all) and table consensus.<br/><br/>So from the GM's perspective, it's important to often communicate things that keep everyone on the same page. "That doesn't look likely", or "He doesn't hold his sword like a true fighter," or "You've jumped further distances before, and carrying less weight."<br/><br/>And from the player's perspective, it's important to frequently make sure you understand your circumstances and odds. "Does her horse look fleeter or heartier than mine?" or "Do I think I can hit a moving target at that range?"<br/><br/>That communication happens before the GM says, "Roll!". <i>Afterward</i>, the GM will sometimes but usually NOT announce a target number, and possibly a framework for interpreting it. So you'll get conversations that go like this:<br/><br/><b>Player:</b> Does her horse look fleeter or heartier than mine?<br/><b>GM:</b> Very much so, and you're a good judge of horse-flesh.<br/><b>Player:</b> Fuck it. I bolt anyway! I dig in my spurs!<br/><b>GM:</b> Good luck! Roll me a 17 or better!
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/johnthedm7000" rel="nofollow">johnthedm7000</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>3. What does rolling the die mean for me and my character(s)?</p></div></blockquote>
For you at the table, it might mean the GM is communicating something. "Pay attention to this!" or "You're trying something dangerous!" or "The spotlight's on you now!" or "We're getting started."<br/><br/>It also means that the GM is about to contribute something to the fiction mediated by the die's result: if it rolls low, something worse than you might have expected; high, something better than you might have expected.<br/><br/>In-fiction, it also means there's a chance that <i>fate is turning</i>, here. Something extreme might happen if a 1 or 20 (or the equivalent in whatever dice mechanic you're using) comes up.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/johnthedm7000" rel="nofollow">johnthedm7000</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>4. How do we interpret the results of the die? </p></div></blockquote>
The GM has broad license in interpretation, constrained by:
<ul>
<li><b>The Expected Result: </b>What the most likely outcome is. What you'd be expected to say happens next if nobody touched the dice.</li>
<li><b>The Obvious Alternatives: </b>If things go well, what're the obvious ways they could go well? If they go poorly, what're he obvious ways they could go poorly?</li>
<li><b>Narrative Momentum: </b>If something unexpected happens, you might look to the progress of the session and the mood at the table to feel out just HOW unexpected an outcome you can get away with. If it's at a climactic moment we've been building to for hours, and then someone rolls two 20s in a row, go big!</li>
<li><b>Promises You've Made: </b> As in the above "Rolle me a 17 or better" example.</li>
<li><b>The Roll: </b>Determines whether the GM has license to only say the expected thing; or the expected thing OR an obvious good or bad alternative; or JUST an obviously good or bad alternative; or (nat 1 or 20) something entirely unexpected.</li>

                            Done ethically, with the full participation of the table isn't this just OSR rulings *as* a resolution system? This doesn't sound new to me, this sounds like a codification of the same sort of "hey guys, I'm not invested in whether or not there's something you can use as a shiv in this prison cell. Let's roll a d6. 1-2 means there's no shiv, 3-4 means there's something (maybe a bone shard or fragment of brick) you could use as one, 5-6 means there's an actual honest-to-god dagger or knife stowed away" just as the only game mechanic. <br/><br/>The only thing that differentiates it from hygienic OSR random-content generation is handwavey bullshit where the GM can move the goalposts or decide things in secret. Dread is indeed a functional version of that, because there's an honest-to-god conversation in the rule-book where the GM can say "Hey Becka, if you want to seriously injure this wolf then you're going to need to make two pulls. You've only got a stick after all, and it's a big fucking timber wolf. One pull will force it back and give you some breathing room but it's not going to seriously injure it." <br/><br/>I will say that there's some illusionist bullshit in Dread, where (in example scenarios) it's suggested that the GM make players make pulls for stuff that the GM knows doesn't matter. The core of the system though is:<br/><br/>1. If you're doing something risky, pull a block. Whether something is risky for you is based on the GM's judgment, along with your answers to the scenario's questions. So if you're a police officer, shooting a gun at a stationary target 20 ft away probably isn't risky. If you're just some schmuck, then it probably is. <br/><br/>2. If you're doing something really risky the GM will tell you and ask you to pull multiple blocks to pull it off. <br/><br/>3. If you want to do something really well, tell the GM. They might ask for additional pulls, based on the situation and your answers to the questions. <br/><br/>4. If you wuss out and don't pull, you fail or succeed to no benefit. If you successfully pull, you pull (ha!) it off. If you knock the tower over your character gets taken out of play, or is a goner to be killed off at will by the GM. <br/><br/>That's perfectly functional, assuming everyone's on the same page regarding the shared imagined space and there's a general understanding that the answers players give to questions are going to be respected. Don't make the 30-year veteran entomologist pull to ID an exotic bug. Don't make the power-lifter pull to push a piano in front of a door. <br/><br/>Which really I think is the key to what you folks are calling "spicy" play. It's not anything unique, it's having a group with a shared enthusiasm for and shared understanding of the fiction. And that can exist decoupled from "I roll the dice and then make up whatever I want". I think the key to developing games that scratch this itch is having resolution systems that care more about fictional positioning, genre, and the like than anything else. <br/><br/>A game based on rulings would be pretty cool though...kind of like a World of Dungeons type deal where the group pauses every now and again to make custom moves that fit how they see the world working. Or a barebones sort of deal where the GM can change the resolution system before each roll, but needs to get buy in from the table first and needs to promise different outcomes depending on the die result, and to deliver on that promise. <br/><br/>...so yeah. Mechanics keeping their promises and respecting the fiction are key here, methinks.                         </div>

                            It's definitely not anything unique. It's as old as RPGs and probably older; it's an incredibly natural way to play, and something a lot of groups do by accident, or fall back upon when they're nominally playing some other system.<br/><br/>It's also incredibly easy to do unhygienically: the goal-post moving you mention.<br/><br/>But a lot of the things you want, John, are things that I very much do <i>not</i> want. Bargaining with the GM? Players making meta-game level decisions about mechanical risk vs. narrative reward? Explicitly stating possible outcomes before invoking the mechanics? None of that.<br/><br/>I want players making narrative decisions about risk versus reward. I want players to ask the GM how they perceive the situation—for the character's estimation of her own situation, as verbalized by the conversation between player and GM, to be the common ground that centers the group's expectations of likely outcomes and possible modes of success and misfortune.<br/><br/>This is <i>kind of</i> like OSR "make up a random table and roll on it on-the-fly", and it is <i>kind of</i> like *World moves, but it's clearly just kissing cousins, clearly not exactly the same thing.<br/><br/>Here, I'll make some spicy (heh) claims:<br/><br/><b>1. Illusionism is unhygienic Spicy play.</b><br/><br/><b>2. We don't have a good codified example of pure and hygienic Spicy play (even Jay's GM Cary engages in heavy goal-post moving), but that doesn't mean it's impossible or doesn't exist, any more than pure and hygienic Forgey Nar play was impossible or nonexistant before Ron wrote Sorcerer.</b> </div>

                            That's the thing though, I don't know if it *can* be disentangled from the goalpost moving. For me at least, the thing that makes OSR rulings like my shiv example or Dread's fictional-positioning based bargaining ethical are because there's a promise. Specifically, one akin to your "Get me a 17 or higher." <br/><br/>The only difference really is that by not stating anything about outcomes before the roll, you give the GM a huge amount of room to bullshit and move goalposts either because that's what fits their idea of a good story, or because they think it's what the players want to hear. It's like "roll me a Perception check" *doesn't have an idea of the DC* <br/><br/>Player: I got a 9. <br/><br/>GM: (Reads the room) Ok...you don't see the giant spider swoop down! It's right on your back! <br/><br/>In this case, the roll meant nothing. It doesn't change the fiction one bit, or provide a guide for how the conversation shifts. It's the GM trying to read peoples minds and give them what they want or ignoring that to tell the story they want. The dice don't matter, because they serve only as an ad-hoc justification for fiction, rather than a means of generating it. <br/><br/>Speaking as someone who's been selling stuff for about 10 years, this is the game equivalent of walking into an empty office to "talk to your manager" about giving a customer a discount. You know it's not going to happen, because your manager isn't there. But they don't know it because there's been no conversation about the subject. They think you're in there doing the best you can, and you tell them what they want to hear. <br/><br/>I think the closest non-manipulative example of this sort of play that I can think of is Everway, with Tarot Cards being used in lieu of dice. They don't have any discreet and defined impact on the fiction, but the GM has to use them as a *guide* and the mutual understanding of archetypal symbols and the evocative art serves as a way for player and GM to agree on what happens next. But that's the difference for me at least: in Everway it's called out that the Tarot cards just set the tone of the conversation but don't really determine where it's going to go. It's Who's Line, where the points don't really matter but what's drawn out of the hat (or the deck) does because everyone at the table agrees that it does. <br/><br/>Another potential way to pull this off might be a relatively straightforward resolution system (one that prioritizes fiction as the most important sort of factor) with hidden resolution where the GM marks down the target number on a sheet of paper and narrates results when players roll. You could sell the Player's book with character creation, and the GM's book with the actual moving parts separately so that players are completely focused on the fiction. There'd be no negotiation, but there'd at least be a nod towards holding the GM accountable, especially if you made GM judgments into formal precedent in a similar way to the rulings----rules continuum. <br/><br/>Hiding that information from the players, while keeping the conversation as a focus of play, and having that conversation impact resolution directly would seem to tick all of your boxes while limiting the likelihood that the GM moves goalposts. They still *could* but I find that committing to something tends to keep people honest, at least in the short term.                         </div>

                            Where you think it can't be done, I strongly believe it can! Step one is making a strong commitment to not fucking do it.<br/><br/>Step two is come up with lots of little accountability to tricks to help yourself not do it, because it's easy to do by accident. One of those is to encourage the player-GM back and forth that gets the expected outcome verbalized as the GM's description of the character's assessment of the situation.<br/><br/>Another is to try to silently acknowledge to yourself before the roll what the most likely outcome is. Another is, when you fail to do that (it's hard in practice!), to take a moment to back into it after the fact, and if you can try to incorporate that most-likely outcome into your contribution to the narrative: After rolling a 6 on the d20, "For a moment it seems like you'll overpower him through sheer strength at arms, but your axe sticks in his shield for half a heartbeat and in that opening..."<br/><br/>Step three is practice, practice, practice, because restraining these naughty impulses is not second nature when you crawl out of the womb!<br/><br/>I very much agree that it's easy to slide into cheaty goal-post-moving-y stuff. But it's hardly insurmountable. The main difference between my ideal of functional Spicy play the game designs beloved of the SG community is: in good Spicy play you address this sort of issue with <i>techniques</i> that aim to be as invisible and natural as possible to players; in traditional SG designs you address them with <i>mechanics</i> that are both player and GM facing.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/johnthedm7000">@johnthedm7000</a> I think calling Spicy Die play "OSR random-content generation plus handwavey bullshit" is like calling folk music "death metal with busted amps."  Direct participant interaction as the primary determinant of what happens next, mediated only sort of and only sometimes by dice, is a feature, not a bug.<br/><br/>Spicy Die play is a horrible way to maximize <i>fairness</i> of outcomes.  That isn't what's being attempted.  The intent is rather to maximize <i>meaningfulness</i> of outcomes.  The GM isn't supposed to care about target numbers.  The GM is supposed to care about upholding their end of the semiotic jazz in progress.  Whether the die roll matters a little, a lot, or not at all, is intentionally subordinate to the melody of the moment.<br/><br/>The difficulty in communicating this does perhaps point to two needs:<br/><br/><b>1: The need to sever inapplicable associations.</b><br/><br/>A player attempting an uncertain action, picking up a die, shaking it in their hand, rolling it, watching in anticipation for the result, reacting to the number, whatever it may be... none of that is appropriate for "GM decides, roll factors in to some some degree which may be very small".  I wonder if a better procedure* would be that the when a player attempts something uncertain:<br/><br/>1) the GM starts telling them what happens, and then <br/>2) in the middle of their narration <i>the GM</i> rolls a die at exactly the moment where <i>they</i> perceive the most uncertainty, and then<br/>3) the GM tweaks their narration significantly on a 1 or a 20, less significantly on any other result<br/><br/>The GM could also indicate degree of uncertain via die size.  d4 means "who knows?"  (1 = disaster, 4 = triumph, so 50% wacky), d10 means "some volatility" (20% wacky), and d20 means "I basically know what happens here, but 10% maybe not."<br/><br/><b>2: The need to sell the upside of this alternative.</b><br/><br/>"Okay, so some people get a lot out of playing in this 'Spicy Die' way.  What exactly do they get that's any <i>different</i> than what I get out of playing with formal rules and binding die rolls and whatnot?"<br/><br/>I hope Jay can answer this.  I can't articulate it concisely.  Just two relevant thoughts:<br/><br/>1) It's an <i>experiential</i> preference.  Sometimes the fictional <i>events</i> of play (including outcomes of character actions) are less important than <i>how</i> they are experienced by the participants.  Sometimes, any more input than "this goes better/worse than it maybe could have" qualifies as an interruption to the fiction-making flow/pace of speech.<br/><br/>2) Beyond the question of "what <i>would happen</i> based on these immeasurable fictional particulars" there's also the question of "what <i>matters</i> based on the people and the moment".  No rule or mechanic can ever answer either of these questions in quite the same way as a sufficiently skilled participant.  A good rule offers something <i>of its own</i> to the equation (which is why people bother using it), so the result you get is less purely a matter of the fiction appearing to act as a causal agent in itself.                        </div>

                            I wonder if Spicy Die play is "freeform plus"?  A lot of the foundation I'm seeing as required here is basically the foundation for good freeform.<br/><br/>Most published freeform games I'm aware of carefully engineer a set-up so that once everyone is properly oriented, they can just "go" and all their interactions will naturally develop the shared fictional matters of interest in a meaningful way.  I wonder when "you all have reasons to want to complete this fantasy adventure quest" does and does not cover those bases.<br/><br/>Jay, do you think it's correct to think of spicy die rolls as punctuating freeform play, or is that not accurate in your game?                        </div>

                            Also, I should note that I'm testing my own understanding of Jay's game here.  I hope I get it, but maybe I don't.  I get freeform, and I get trusting the GM to do their job, but I don't think I've ever played with the particular combo of "GM as causality arbiter" and "GM as fellow Semiotic Jazz band member".<br/><br/>My procedure suggestion in my opening post was much more "impartial ref" and my suggestion in my last reply to John was more "flowing with the vibe" and now I'm not sure which is a better fit.<br/><br/>When I GM OSR stuff, I strive to be exciting, but only <i>within</i> the constraints of impartial fairness.  I have no idea what the opposite (striving for fairness, but only within being exciting) would feel like.  And I don't know if that's what Jay's GM is doing anyway.                        </div>

                            Eeeeeeenh. Idunno. Insofar as any RPG is "freeform, minus some techniques used in freeform, plus a bunch of other rules and techniques."<br/><br/>Saying it's freeform+ is maybe a more useful way of understanding what's going on at that table (compared to "Like D&amp;D minus this plus this"), but hardly necessary or sufficient to describe what's actually happening.

I have tried that with my 'spicy roll' inspired vanilla fantasy troupe play minicampaign and what I found was that rolling a 6 or a 1 with d6s is not as exciting as with the d20!

                            My instincts tell me that in a spicy roll game the GM shouldn't be an impartial ref but more like the 'fan of the characters' on square! Also this style needs more trust from the players than usual. So their principle might be something like 'be the fan of the GM's vision'. Otherwise any situation falls into everlasting bickering and positioning. <br/><br/>Also, one important function of rolling in a spicy roll game (and to a less extent in any RPG) is not resolution, but to get the players attention. For various psychological reasons GM info dumps after the roll are more meaningful to players (as 'results') than before it (as 'establishing details').                        </div>

It also makes for math that's both simple and a bit obscure at the same time ( fraction based rather than percent based like d10 or d20).<br/><br/>It also feels better than smaller dice types, much like d20 does for spicy rolls, but with a smaller range, so a higher likelihood of something happening.<br/><br/>I mean really, it's the Goldie Locks die <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> <br/><br/>( I feel like I should get sort of kickback from the D12 Manufacturers Consortium having posted this)                        </div>

I can see a problem here in a fundamental error regarding an assumption about what happens at the table during actual roleplay.  Dice or mechanics ONLY matter because we players all AGREE that they matter.  Mechanics cannot enforce themselves.  Only the players can implement or respect or agree (choose the word that facilitates understanding best) that a "mechanic" is valid, useful and will be followed <i>here and now</i>.  A poster (Vincent Baker [further note - apparently Emily Care Boss was also instrumental in forumation this idea]) proposed this understanding role-play many years ago and it eventually went  by the name <i>The lumpley principle</i> (lumpley was Vincent's screen name at the time - don't know if he still uses it or not.)<br/><br/>In short Vincent propounded the theory that the only things that "happen in play" are because ALL the players are in agreement about whatever piece of information is being introduced.  To speed matters along and to try and help shape the nature of play, mechanics might be agreed to by all the players as being useful shortcuts to this decision making process.  But make no mistake the mechanics cannot and do not self-enforce themselves into the shared imagined space.  Just in the same way "mechanics" cannot and do not "generate the fiction."  Ultimate that is <b>entirely</b> the players' doing.  The game system cannot function without the players making it so.  This is not hairsplitting.  This fundamental and foundational.  The "rules", the "mechanics", the "system" that governs the means by which fictional elements are introduced and then agreed to have entered into the shared imagined space can only happen because <b>all the players</b> agree that said piece of information enters via the mutually agreed upon "system."<br/><br/>Mechanics decide nothing and categorically cannot decide anything unless all the players agree that the output of the mechanics system as processed by some player (usually the GM but not necessarily) is viable.  If anyone wishes to read more on this topic a thread called, shockingly enough, <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=30072.0" rel="nofollow">The lumpley principle</a> contains links that includes some interesting conversations on the topic while it is debated and worked through.  There are also some other phrasings of the lumpley principle that are probably easier to understand.<br/><br/>Best                        </div>

                            Finally - the "moving goal post" controversy/misunderstanding.<br/><br/>Any game where the GM "moves the goal post" is almost assuredly deprotagonizing.  There may be instances where this is a design feature of the game but I can't think of any at the moment.<br/><br/>WRT to event that I posted about let me clear a few things up.  <br/><br/>First of all, as the game is experiential as opposed to objective (<i>just like in real life!</i>) any information that is given to a player via his character is a "perception" not an objective-meta-truth.<br/><br/>Second, given that all input is treated as "perception" the questions asked and the answers given are in estimates and in terms of plausibility not fixed absolute values.<br/><br/>Third, this use of plausibility and estimates allow far more play opportunities than fixed numerical values.  If you will note in the original exchange I posted the GM never gave distance to target and one was never asked.  The player just assumed that the target was in range and took action.  Instead of the GM saying, "the Druid is 100 yards away and thus impossible for you to reach" he allowed for the attempt since distance was not a fixed established feature.<br/><br/>Finally, the phrase "don't talk to me unless you roll a twenty" is so very much more than a mere target number.  As noted in so many posts above "20's" are extraordinary events.  So the GM in stating the above is "communicating" to the player that what he is attempting to do is right on the very edge of plausibility.  By requiring further roles of an extraordinary nature "an additional 20, hitting in the head (89-00 on percentile dice), upper 50 percentile of the damage dice (4-6 on a d6), etc." he's doing two things.  The DM is further communicating just how very, very difficult said task was in these staggered out roll requests.  But also he's raising the energy at the table with each success of the die roll.  This was the reason for all the cheering and yelling at the player's success.  We had been given time to invest in the unfolding events and get excited as each extraordinary roll came up.<br/><br/>Instead of stating that what the player was doing the impossible (because this was supposed to be the night's BBEG) he allowed the event and by extension the reality of the world to unfold with the dice rolls.  The player's dwarf not only slew the bad guy very early in the night with all experience that came with that he freaking killed the the guy in a single blow!  He was also awarded a permanent +1 to the character's strength.  Why?  It was not only a reward for succeeding against very steep odds but it also helps to establish how this seemingly impossible feat was accomplished.  The dwarf was stronger than he thought or ever had reason to push himself until <b>this</b> point in time.  We just jazzed in new information into the shared imagined space in a really flipping exciting fashion!<br/><br/>If the goal post could be argued that it moved, it went from what should have been impossible to merely highly improbable but doable.  But the goal post was not established before the player took action.  The player had only the vaguest notion about the difficulty (range to target) of what he was attempting but the DM gave his the chance...and the player succeeded in a highly memorable manner.<br/><br/>This was but a single method for dealing with a situation.  It is not one that is used very often because using it too often would make the extraordinary banal thus altering the baseline of the world.<br/><br/>The takeaway from this example is that deterministic resolution mechanics would have forbidden success.  By using this particular method features of the world were established as the rolling continued and ultimately ended in an extremely emotionally satisfying manner.  New understandings/meanings were established about the world and the system via semiosis.  No "cheating" or "robbing" the player here.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay<br/><br/>Edited - for some minor improvements in clarity and to remove a few of the many pestiferous typos.                        </div>

Obviously, without players there's no game. The assumption is <i>not</i> that the mechanics generate fiction - or not - <i>by themselves</i>, but that they generate fiction <i>when agreed upon and implemented by the players</i>. "Mechanics generate fiction" is just a linguistic shorthand for that. Is there really a need, in this context, to specify that a mechanic doesn't work by magic but by the players enacting it?                        </div>

Or perhaps it depends on what you hear in the term "freeform"?  When I talk about <i>successful</i> freeform, what I mean is that non-mechanical techniques are shouldering the load that other games assign to mechanics.  But perhaps the term "freeform" doesn't really communicate that by itself.                        </div>

                            "Freeform" is one of those words that has a weird tendency to be used as an expletive regularly, mainly as a way of describing some assumed ( although doubtfully ever seen) role-playing game of primal chaos, where nothing makes even as much sense as a truly horrific acid trip. <br/><br/>Goals posts moving?

                            Hi David,<br/><br/>Regarding proposal <b>1: The need to sever inapplicable associations</b> -<br/>I couldn't agree more.  The single most important association to sever is the "task resolution" paradigm.  "Task resolution" is typically best suited to promoting and rewarding the Gamist mode of play.  Here's my admittedly kneejerk worry.  People see "rules" in a book and suddenly they are inviolate gospel.  As I've indicated I believe the overt mechanics system of the game 1. are not deterministic and 2. are truly part of the creation process themselves.  If we get too hung up on printing up various of methods my concern is that the desire for one to become deterministic will kill the fact that the mechanics can and must evolve over play.  Like I said this is my initial thinking on this.  It may work just fine as you proposed but 40+ years of the hobby militate strongly in favor of my concerns.<br/><br/>Also consider all the various reasons to roll jeph listed in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/477856/#Comment_477856" rel="nofollow">his post earlier</a>.  There are just so many different ways to use the dice that putting even helpful constraints will, I believe, lead to the unhygenic use of non-deterministic mechanics.  To borrow from jeph in short order such things as Tempo, Fishing for Licence, Signal (Ritual) all fall outside the purview of your proffered suggestions.<br/><br/>Regarding <b>2: The need to sell the upside of this alternative.</b> -<br/>Focusing on the "Spicy Die" alone as a plug in mechanic/systems fails because the scope is too small.  It needs to be explained within the context of the whole of this particular Creative Agenda.  The "Spicy Die" has it role to play (no pun intended) but to really make it work and to help those truly understand how it supports the Simulationist (Ugh) Agenda one must first understand what the Agenda is about.  No one has to explain why deterministic resolution systems need to work for Gamist or Narrativist play they just create the various mechanics based on the understanding of the Creative Agenda that they are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hoping</span> the players will use.<br/><br/>I think, but I'm not a game designer, that if one is really interested in running a game that uses non-deterministic mechanics the place to start would be with explaining the Sim CA first and then go into how the "spicy die" system supports and aids that mode of play.<br/><br/>That's my take on it at the present.  I'd have to spend more time in consideration to offer something more concrete.  My apologies.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

Nah....that would be reading the book or watching the movie.  Showing mastery in the material would be some sort of Trivial Pursuit game where displaying knowledge is the goal.  Sim requires a certain mastery of the essence/themes of the material such that all we players can make aesthetically sound additions to said source (or the Standard to use jazz parlance) within the Shared Imagined Space.<br/><br/>It is most definitely not passive.  Sim is an active creation process....or you don't have Exploration/role-play, ipso facto.  That's always been the problem with "Sim" discussion.  Many people dismiss it outright because they don't or can't see the creation process.  And for a game to be considered role-play <i>something </i>more must exist as a result of play than prior.  Merely wallowing in the source material or showing off one's knowledge does neither.<br/><br/>Hence, "Semiotic Jazz."                        </div>

I agree. Constantly recreating and upholding an 'external vision' requires a lot of focus and proactivity from the group, because it's not just the GM's job to do that.                        </div>

                            Hi Jay,<br/><br/>Hmm, I see your point about how laying out an explicit procedure for how rolls are made wouldn't fully capture what actually happens at your table.  Maybe that's okay, though?  Do you think your table would suffer at all from being bound by restrictions like these?<br/>• whether the player or GM rolls<br/>• when a roll is made in the course of a player character action (before/during/after)<br/>• what information should be communicated around (before/during/after) a roll<br/><br/>I agree that "always roll when your character does X action" rules would be ill-fitting.  But I'm not seeing how "the GM always begins to say what happens before rolling" would cause problems.<br/><br/>As for selling the upside, you're right, I meant the upside of semiotic jazz, not the upside of spicy die rolls.  I was just hoping that the pitch would also make clear why deterministic mechanics weren't being used.  But perhaps we'll see whether that falls out naturally or not.<br/><br/>What do you see as the perks of semiotic jazz?  I'm not looking for a description of what it <i>is</i>, just a list of a few top highlights (the more unique the better).<br/><br/>When I pitch immersive games, I pitch what it's like to experience imagined events "from within", as if you're there.  Do you have some sort of equivalent?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>-David                        </div>

My apologies komradebob if I mischaracterized your statements or your intentions.  I just used the dictionary sense of the phrases you employed and drew my conclusions from there.  If you would be willing I would deeply appreciate it if you could explain to me how the descriptor of "wallowing" demonstrates the mechanism of what is actually going on at the table that demonstrates the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">creative construction process of more "world/character/imagined cultures/etc."</span>  That's the whole purpose of my musings.  Not just what do we call Sim but rather what exactly is the Sim process.<br/><br/>To me the dictionary sense of "wallowing" is not a word that connotes creative improvised construction.  I freely admit that I could be too dim to make the connection myself so if you could help me understand that would be wonderful!<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay<br/><br/>Addendum - I know you also used "showing mastery" as a definition as well but I believe the same issues apply.  How does "showing mastery" of the source material illuminate the process of game play that leads to the constrained creative construction improvisation?                        </div>

Both, I should think.  The key is to explain and <b>use</b> the character sheets as the starting point of play.  IOW they should be the tool that the player and the DM use as the starting point for understanding the character.  I truth one could even go so far as the not use numbers for attributes but abstractions i.e., for strength one could use extremely weak, very weak, weak, average, strong, very strong, near human maximum.  The sheet helps construct the nature and perhaps the visual image of the character but what it shouldn't do is tell the player how to play in a deterministic fashion.  For example smart play can result in new skills being added to the sheet during play.<br/><br/>Again the character sheet is a touch point and should aid in maintaining some sort of consistency for the player but it most certainly should not prescriptive.  What matters is most is who your character is not the specific value of numbers.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

To answer your first question, sure!  Whatever system you use that works best for your table and the type of gaming experience you'd like to facilitate is what you should be using.<br/><br/>To answer your second question, I believe that our game play would suffer quite a bit.<br/><br/>If the wording was changed from restrictions to suggestions I think that would be better, but I should note that in our game the DM rarely rolls.  He tends to roll more in combat but the sense I get is he's "fishing" for the general gist of how the combat flow is going.  Most checks are done by having us players roll to see if we succeed, not the DM.  What I mean is that he rarely rolls against us but rather lets our rolls be the primary signifier of the outcome.  This works because it puts the pressure on us players.  We can modify the power of the roll by how we roleplay or explain exactly what we are trying to do.  FREX - if we're trying to negotiate something with an NPC or talk down a potential fight it is primarily up to our ability as players to bring it to the table or our chances just won't be very good despite whatever skill we're trying to employ.  We NEVER say, "I use my 'Fast Talk'" to get the barbarian leader to stand down his horde.  We just start dialoguing with the NPC and roll when called upon.  The better as players we handle the situation the more likely we'll get the outcome we're trying to achieve.  However, on rare occasions the GM might say, "You don't want me rolling a 1, 2, 3 or 4" and then rolls in front of us.  Again the timing of when or how he may call for a die roll or rarely rolls himself depends on the drama of the situation.  Very difficult to codify explicitly when and who should roll and how.<br/><br/>Most of the times when a roll is called for it is after a player has stated an intention.  It is during combat when the coupling between intention and rolling is tightest but even here it is frequently less than 1 to 1.  Often we are miming the weapon swings ("in real time") against each other and when one or the other misinterprets a mimed swing (and "misses") a die roll is usually called for.  Sometimes (rarely) we can mime a swing so effectively or catch the DM so off guard we can dispatch a foe with no rolls at all.  If there foe is significantly better than the PC more rolls tend to be called for.<br/><br/>Sometimes skills rolls are called for when the circumstances for executing said skill are difficult or when the necessary skill required is very difficult.  Conversely if our skill is very high and the difficulty is low a roll maybe just waved off.  Or if the stakes of the success or failure are high a roll is called for.  Sometimes a skill roll is called for as a way for the DM to communicate that "Hey, what you're trying to do is likely beyond you.  Are you sure you want to continue?")<br/><br/>Regarding what info to be provided before is entirely situationally dependent.  Often times when travelling we are told to roll without any information.  Can't tell a player to roll for surprise because by telling them to roll for surprise ruins the surprise!  Sometimes we check appropriate skill checks if we roll "20's" during these travel situations.  (Bushcraft, hunting, tracking, trapping, forest lore, mountain lore, horsemanship, weather sense, move silent, etc.)  We have a skill called Intuition which is very similar to Spider Man's spider sense. He'll just call for a table roll and if anyone rolls either very poor or very high they'll get a "danger" feeling.  Sometimes a player might be attempting something extraordinarily dangerous and the DM might just say, "Danger, danger."  The player has a few moments to perhaps amend their action but if they don't are can't think of something else to do then the action proceeds and is resolved. Again, the warning is a way of intensifying the moment as the player who is taking action has a quick choice of backing off or doubling down.<br/><br/>I suppose one of the things requires the players to really invest, dig in and pay attention to the world is that the DM drops hints without making out of game truth statements.  IOW we have to "read" the DM much as we might have to "read" situations in real life.  This deductive process requires us to keep the world firmly in mind so we can tell when there is a change in the status quo.  This is especially true when dealing with NPC's who have their own desires, fears, goals and motivations.  And by hints it may be as subtle as what he's doing with his eyes or what his finger tips are doing.
<blockquote>But I'm not seeing how "the GM always begins to say what happens before rolling" would cause problems.</blockquote>
I'll offer an analogy and hope this helps.  We're all jazz musicians playing live at a gig.  The one playing the solo changes key and then hands off play to another soloist.  The DM making the truth statement about what is being rolled for would be akin to the first soloist about stopping play, turning to the soloist next to him and saying, "I'm going to change key to G-flat."  Then resuming his solo with the key change and then handing off to the next soloist.  If you are looking for that rapid, intense, fluid play then one would make the effort to not stop playing music as much as possible.  It may be unavoidable but I would think minimizing the breaks in playing would be your goal.  And here's the kicker, continuing with the analogy, if you can handle that key change (FREX) on the fly then all the more exciting it becomes.  Here's another analogy, but not stopping the game to constantly explain the die roll is akin to tightrope walking without a net.  Much more intense.<br/><br/>Having to figure out what's going on rather than having the DM spoon feed everything to you demands much more of the players.  It is also makes the act of role playing that much more rewarding.  The fact you as the player may misinterpret the information and hints given forces said player to really shift gears towards a first person perspective and to be "in the moment."  Juggling all this information and absolutely having to draw conclusions from it virtually guarantees that a player is using the same skills set as we do in our daily lives to make sense of the world.  However, in our case, because the information is "fictional" then the player has to function those survival skills within that "fictional" game space.  Kick up the stakes and pacing and emotions will quickly follow our "perspective".                        </div>

<blockquote>What do you see as the perks of semiotic jazz? I'm not looking for a description of what it is, just a list of a few top highlights (the more unique the better).</blockquote>
As I alluded to above.  The perks to semiotic jazz are an intense, in your face, fast paced, easy to learn, easy to play gaming experience.  Because the skills sets needed to play are very similar to our own daily skills learning how to play is almost intuitive.  The only paper we have is the character sheet.  There is no player's hand book.  You don't need to read a huge book and memorize endless rules.  Frequently we'll partner the new player with an experienced play to help them along - kinda like a mentorship.  But learning to play effectively and well can take a long time (on the order of months to a couple of years).  That is not a bad thing as "learning how the world works" frequently is the most intense play for players.  Our DM is loathe to stop play but one time at a game store a new player's face was turning to red that the DM was afraid that said player was going to have a stroke.  After the game the DM asked the player what he thought to which he replied, "That was the most intense gaming experience of my life.  I will never do that again.  I play to relax."  His hands were trembling as he tried to light his cigarette.
<blockquote>When I pitch immersive games, I pitch what it's like to experience imagined events "from within", as if you're there. Do you have some sort of equivalent?</blockquote>
When we're trying to recruit a new player we sometimes tell the person that it's like actually being in their favorite movie, only they get to actually do things within it!  Right now!  Just like their favorite actor would.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay<br/> </div>

                            I'm just catching up on this thread!<br/><br/>Lots of interesting discussion here, but I am also a bit mystified, because it is also very familiar to me.<br/><br/>The whole process of the charismatic, auteuristic GM who essentially runs a freeform, immersive roleplaying game for his/her friends, while being pretty vague about the actual rules in play (because s/he changes them as it suits the game, or simply improvises) is, to me, a form of naive roleplaying I've seen take place just about everywhere.<br/><br/>(I'm using "naive" in the sense of "natural" or "untrained", like the term "naive art".)<br/><br/>My experience is that the success of this kind of play is largely dependent on a) the charisma and creativity of the GM, and b) the ability of the players to truly buy into what's happening and engage with it emotionally, which largely depends on their trust in the GM.<br/><br/>The actual *process* of play doesn't seem that mysterious to me (although, of course, any kind of freeform play is necessarily highly complex on the social level).<br/><br/>Effectively, the GM's skillset and social charisma *are* the game in this kind of enterprise.<br/><br/>For me to feel otherwise, I'd have to see an example of how this kind of play can be really effective even absent my (a) and (b), above. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21370/critical-role-and-the-rise-of-d-d" rel="nofollow">I've been thinking a bit about <i>Critical Role</i> recently</a>, and wondering whether it might not have been better suited by something like the "Spicy Roll System": not only would that suit the viewers' interests better (and be more pleasurably to watch) but Matt Mercer seems like an excellent candidate for someone who can do it well (and, on top of that, it would make his job much easier, while still delivering the same results).<br/><br/>The particular details don't seem all that important to me: for instance, it sounds like the Spicy Roll game we're talking about here uses characters sheets (presumably character sheets from a certain, specific published roleplaying game), but I can't imagine any way in which a character sheet with certain attributes or statistics on it is in any way a vital part of this kind of game. In short, if I joined the game in progress and my character sheet was a colour illustration of my character instead, the experience of play would be no different - for me, the GM, or the other players.<br/><br/>I wrinkled my nose a bit at the amusing nod to the character sheet when the dward gained +1 Strength (as related earlier in this thread). It's a cute touch, but clearly has no real impact on the game - the incident itself and the fictional implications overshadow any number on the character sheet itself, which may as well be discarded.<br/><br/>Writing down "this one time, I did this and my character discovered newfound strength!" would be much more useful and relevant. If the +1 Strength on the sheet helps the group remember that, that's great, but to say it's important to the game in any way seems pretty misguided.<br/><br/><br/>Jay,<br/><br/>I think it's interesting that you dismissed the phrase "show mastery of the Source Material", but, to me, that's exactly what you're describing: 
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>But learning to play effectively and well can take a long time (on the order of months to a couple of years).

Perhaps it's because you're looking at "Source Material" as the books or other fictional touchstones which inform your play? (After all, it sounds like your game is based on/in the Tolkien universe.) But, of course, this style of gaming can work just as well without a literary touchstone, in a universe created from scratch by the group, so I have to take "Source Material" to mean "the combined knowledge of the game we're playing right now, right here, and everything we have established so far in playing it together".<br/><br/><br/> </div>

                            I do wonder at how replicable the success of such a game is, and I think that the attempt to break down some of the principles, techniques, and assumptions is really fruitful. Some of Jeph's lists and suggestions in this thread are really thorough and thought-provoking, in that vein. I'll be rereading those before I start a game like this, for sure (if I ever do, that is).                        </div>

                            Hey Jay,<br/><br/>I agree that interrupting the flow of play to clarify procedures isn't a great Plan A.<br/><br/>But I think allowing play to unfold in complete ignorance is way, way worse.  No one can engage with a fiction that isn't solid to them.  Before I decide, in character, what to do, I need to know what I <i>can</i> do ("Am I close enough to grab the thing?"), and communicating that information <i>completely</i> destroys any equivalence between real-person lived time and character lived time.  Roleplaying is talking, and talking is way slower than directly sensing.<br/><br/>So, given that the roleplay conversation is already slower than actually being there, and given that we absolutely <i>can</i> achieve an experience that <i>feels</i> fast-paced (I'm with you there!), I don't think this is about time at all.  I think it's about energy and attention.  If we are able to keep our attention on the fiction, and it is useful and rewarding to keep our attention on the fiction, and there are no breaks in that attention, then I think we achieve that momentum and flow you and I both love so much.<br/><br/>Under <i>that</i> schema, although a break in play to discuss <i>pure</i> meta/procedural concerns is bad (e.g. dice pool construction), quickly relating fiction to such cues, IMO, is not.  "10 will suffice oh look I rolled a 9" doesn't strike me as interrupting attention to the fiction.  Or, perhaps better, "This looks about 50/50!  I rolled a 9!  What happens?"  In that situation, I don't see how anything is <i>lost</i> by the GM saying, "Seems about 50/50!" and I think we do <i>gain</i> orientation, with the player, in character, aware of how their odds appear.  (And if they have no information about their odds in fiction, then I'm completely happy for the GM to stay silent, and for that silence to carry meaning to the players.)<br/><br/>Maybe your group communicates this already?  Or maybe every player who ever rolls a die concludes literally nothing from the number rolled until Cary speaks thereafter?

In a game in which you get in your character's shoes and inhabit their fictional environment, and in which the GM is the sole deliverer of that environment, I don't see any spectrum of spoon-feeding, nor any opportunity for figuring out.  You know what the GM tells you, period.<br/><br/>Are you just talking about paying close attention to what the GM tells you, and <i>acting from confident deductions</i> based on that, as opposed to <i>making tentative deductions and inquiring</i>?  That sets off some alarms for me.  I've seen no quicker way to totally <i>break</i> fiction-first play that for players to confidently act with incomplete information and then be told that their character did something which is clearly nonsensical in retrospect.  That effectively means there's no shared imagined space to play in.<br/><br/>My last thought is that maybe you're talking about the "read my NPCs" challenge.  Which I've written <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19884/can-we-make-reading-the-gms-mind-more-reliably-fun" rel="nofollow">long threads</a> about and I think is very difficult to pin down.

I've run lots of games with a long, deep, immersive flow, but no one's ever looked like they were going to have a stroke.  Perhaps our conversational pace is more leisurely than yours?  Are you guys all, like, screaming over each other or something???

If so, I think that's important to note!  I think that's an understated component of certain styles of RPG play.  When someone asks, "What do the players really contribute in a railroaded Call of Cthulhu adventure?" my answer is often, "Portrayal!  To bring it to life with their acting."<br/><br/>I hope all these questions are interesting!  Sorry this is getting a bit long and multi-pronged.  I still like the idea of distilling your play into principles and procedures, but I keep discovering new things that make me wonder if I truly do <i>get</i> what makes it what it is.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>-David                        </div>

                            Hey Paul!<br/><br/>I'm totally with you that Spicy play is a very natural sort of process, that crops up in the wild frequently when people are new to the activity or isolated from other groups. I think a lot of folks start out playing this way and sort of unconsciously abandon it and drift away as natural instincts are overridden by the learned culture of How To Play RPGs.<br/><br/>But I'm also mystified that you're mystified! From one breath to the next, you can say that the process of play doesn't seem at all mysterious and flows entirely from the GM's charisma and creativity... and that the lists and suggestions I've compiled would be a big help in effectively replicating this play style.<br/><br/>So: <b>It's natural, but it's not natural to me.</b>* And once you've drifted away, it's definitely not natural to return to this style. And if you're already playing in this style, it's not necessarily natural to do so <i>hygienically</i>, or do so <i>well</i>.<br/><br/><small>* My own naive play took a very different form, based on second-hand descriptions of D&amp;D play from a friend whose dad had played D&amp;D in college. About half a dozen of the neighborhood kids would wander through the back yards and parks in the area. We'd pick up sticks and stuff and say we were the wizard or fighter or whatever. One of the older kids, initially, and later me, would be the "DM": they'd describe the room, and monsters or obstacles or traps or treasure in it. We'd say what we did, including what part of the monster's body we were aiming for, and the GM would say if we missed or killed or injured the target, and then who the monsters attacked and if it missed or injured us (then we'd have to limp or not use a hand) or knocked us out. This was all resolved purely on GM fiat, with finding the monster's "weak spot" being the main pseudo-mechanic. Later, we got the 3e Monster Manual; we didn't know what the rules meant, but Sam, the older kid, used the pictures and special abilities to help him stock our outdoor dungeons. A little later, we moved from wandering around outdoors to sitting around a table, with dungeons sketched on graph paper, but still no real rules. A few months later we got the full set of 3e books and lost our naive method.</small><br/><br/>By investing a lot of time and energy in learning what's going on at tables that do Spicy play well, I've learned to do it myself well enough to have a very satisfying gaming experience over the course of about a dozen, fifteen sessions.<br/><br/>So it can be analyzed! Transmitted! Replicated! Learned!                        </div>

                            Ah! I can clarify:<br/><br/>The general form/shape of the process for this kind of play, and one's role in it as a player, seems fairly intuitive to me. I've seen a lot of groups do this at one time or another (sometimes without even noticing!). <br/><br/>I'm not sure how the form of "naive play" you're describing there really differs from it, in any significant way (in terms of its procedures, anyway).<br/><br/>(But, of course, you are also correct that there are other forms of "naive play" that are possible - probably an infinite variety. I'm just saying that this is one I've seen a lot.)<br/><br/>What I find mysterious and interesting is two things:<br/><br/>1. People's confusion about this topic, when it seems fairly natural and self-explanatory to me. It's rarely discussed in explicit terms, which is what makes this discussion fresh and interesting, but I'd guess it's familiar to many/most roleplayers. <br/><br/>I think it's a very natural leap to make from D&amp;D-like task resolution mechanics to more story-oriented play, as well.<br/><br/>I'm trying to think of a D&amp;D game where this DIDN'T happen at least occasionally, and I can hardly think of any. The way the rules are structured make it very easy to fall into "spicy die" play, even by accident - the whole "roll dice as an oracle, then furrow your brow and make something up" technique is very natural to slip in to in D&amp;D play of most varieties, unless you specifically try hard not to (e.g. Eero's concept of "hygienic play").<br/><br/><i>As a sidenote, I often refer to this kind of gaming as <a href="https://github.com/brunobord/micro-rpg-catalog/blob/master/six-word-rpg.md" rel="nofollow">Mark Hughes's "Six Word RPG"</a>, which describes it quite well, in my opinion.<br/><br/>I played a "non-naive" version of this when I GMed <i>Fudge</i> campaigns in the early 2000's. The adjective scale didn't correspond to any concrete details or rules, so I could use the outcomes of any roll as a handy oracle to interpret for narration - "You get a Mediocre outcome? Ok, I bet I know what that loks like..." - and I was pleasantly surprised by how "real" this made play feel, since we no longer had mechanics giving us jarring outcomes. Instead, I would mentally calibrate my mental image of the scene or situation to the adjective scale - Terrible would be the worst possible likely outcome, and Superb the best possible likely outcome, with rolls "off the chart" producing unlikely or strange outcomes - so that any given roll always produced a believable result. (Assuming the players buy into the GM's aesthetics of the fictional situation, which isn't always a given - that's what David_Berg is talking about in his comments above.)</i><br/><br/>2. The internal mental processes of the GM who is highly skilled in this style of play. A great deal of it - perhaps as much as 90%! - as I said above, is simply charisma and earned trust, but some of it is a certain way of thinking or resolving things which allows her to make good calls and produces a good game over the long term (the real challenge).<br/><br/>This part is rarely discussed openly (as it is being here), so delving into those details is pretty fascinating. (In my experience, most GMs who run games in this style are unwilling to divulge any details about how they do so, since they value the "illusion" of rules, fairness, and the "black box GM": the GM must appear inscrutable and mysterious, and maintain the illusion of fair play, in their minds, to make this work. This makes honest conversations about their actual methods impossible, sadly. It's nice to hear that there are some groups where the players are aware and acknowledge that it's all smoke and mirrors but are still willing to suspend disbelief and enjoy the game.)<br/><br/>I think that, for instance, David's discussion of GM-side priorities is interesting. I've done the "pick a plausible outcome, and hopefully it's interesting, if possible" thing, with some success, but I've never really done "pick an interesting outcome, and aim for plausible". They're subtly different, but maybe the impact on long-term play could be very different.<br/><br/>(Ultimately I abandoned this style of play for how little input the players had to the game, but that doesn't mean other people can't enjoy it, or that I wouldn't be willing to try it again sometime.)                        </div>

                            I've decided to do an experiment with Naïve Gaming this X-Mas. I'm sending my nerdy friends' children ( and nieces and nephews in some cases) a box containing a bunch of fantasy toy people*, a set of dice, and a small blank book.<br/><br/>I want to see if, with some description of RPGs from their adult nerd mentors ( some with a lot of experience with RPGs, some with almost none), they can essentially (re)create the wheel ( or at least something similar to the Brontes' games or HG Wells Floor Games, but with dice added).<br/><br/><br/>Hopefully this may also give pointers to other things, such as Naïve versions of source material creation and miniatures use.<br/><br/>* Okay, half of the boxes are medieval style fantasy, the other half are modern style fantasy with monsters/zombies/aliens/humans. Spooky Kids/ Baby Baybats need attention too!<br/><br/>If I get interesting reports back or observe something useful to this conversation regarding Spicy Dice in their natural environment ( <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=":wink:"/> )  , I will post about it.                        </div>

I suspect a less-mean ( maybe?), less-game-y RPG version of Calvinball is the most likely result, but honestly, that's okay. I mean, those literary Names I name-checked basically created their own forms of Naïve RPG 100+ years ago without dice or other tools. I want to see what happens when the other tools are available. Maybe I will throw in some Itras By cards too.<br/><br/><br/>I'm more interested in what happens when there has been less RPG hobby contact through whichever adult ultimately gives the gift box to the young'uns. That and if there is any difference by gender of the young'uns.<br/><br/><br/>And, of course, if Spiciness of Dice Use occurs.<br/><br/> </div>

For what it's worth, I've always assumed that it wasn't just just *charisma* in Cary's case, but also the fact that he's a professional screenwriter (IIRC) that helped make the game so emotionally engaging. It's not just the charisma and misdirection of a stage magician who makes you "believe" the magic is real, but he was also delivering legitimately good stories.<br/><br/>I mean they're definitely two sides of the "skilled storyteller" coin, but I'm thinking about expectations that, "In a roleplaying game, we create a story," and what that actually means for people in practice. A sort of one-sided Story Now agenda? That is to say, if you as a player have minimal input, the sudden unexpected twists and turns are creating engaging story in the moment, rather than creating events that are shaped into a narrative after the fact.                        </div>

                            Wow!  Lost of stuff going on here.  My apologies for the tardiness of my returning.  I will attempt to clarify as best as I am able the various questions and issues raised.  Thank you all for participating in this discussion!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> <br/>I had thought after all you had explained to me about the jazz process (and just how richly detailed and involved that process is) I’d get less hand waving about the Semiotic Jazz process.  Is Jazz “freeform”?  I thought that not only did a soloist need a mastery of the Standard but they also had to have an intimate relationship with the piece.  Does one not also need a strong knowledge (implicit or explicit) of music theory to inform the creation of the chords as well as help inform the actual solo effort?  Is that “just” freeform?  Finally does the soloist “simply” freeform without consideration and the constraints put upon him/her by all the above plus the style of the ensemble?  Are the “rules” of Music Theory “pretty vague”?<br/><br/>Perharps reading Chris Lehrich’s <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=14371" rel="nofollow">Bricolage APPLIED (finally!)</a> , especially his second post, will perhaps help give a better context to what I’m trying but failing to communicate.  This method of creative interaction is almost diametrically opposed to the Western (and Eastern?) abstract thinking processes.  I don’t want to get caught up in the specifics of Bricolage as it is a physical art and we don’t have much in the way of understanding the guiding aesthetics as we do about Jazz.  But as Chris pointed out the general principles of Bricolage stand in well for the “mythic” (concrete) logic process.  Things that are or happen are given meaning by the culture and this accretive process uses what “is” however lumpy and problematic to create more explanations/meanings.  Its messy, the “rules” are intuited by the membership of the “tribe” over time and apparently it is fun.  There are instances where tribes have succeeded in explaining “everything” to satisfaction and scrap what they have created and start over.  This is NOT how the West thinks with its abstractions.  Nor is it a "naive" process but an extremely sophisticated if highly alien way of processing the world and <i>what it <b>means</b> to us human beings.</i> <br/><br/>Re - characters sheets.

<blockquote>I wrinkled my nose a bit at the amusing nod to the character sheet when the dwarf gamined +1 Strength....It’s a cute touch, but clearly has no real impact on the game - the incident itself and the fictional implications overshadow any number on the character sheet itself, which may in itself be discarded.</blockquote>
You miss the critical and long established notion that ALL rewards function at some level as Social Awards.  It was important <i>because it was important to <b>us</b></i>.  I mention the change to the sheet as it functions as a referent to what happened in play.  It is also a sign with meaning that travelled up from the Ephemera level play all the way to the Social Contract level.  On another level it also helped to spackle over the possible dissonance created by the extraordinary event that just transpired.  It was a shorthand method of helping keep the continuity of the implicit “rules of the world” functioning smoothly.

Having "mastery of the Source Material" is necessary but sufficient to play Sim or describe the play process anymore than having mastery of the Standard is the same as playing Jazz.  You keep leaving out the process of choosing the chords from the Standard melody and all the Music Theory that one must also have a mastery of in order to do so.  They aren't chosen by random.  As you indicated to me that the choosing of the chords in not just a mechanic process but requires an "artistic (gift?) touch" to make something more than just a clockwork.  Then follows on the actual creative act of the solo informed by all the above.  Mastery of the Standard or Music Theory or even the instrument singly or even in any given pair of discipline is not sufficient for the production of improvisational jazz.<br/><br/>If I want to try another analogy, admittedly a poor one, learning the "rules" of Chess or Go is easy, learning to play effectively/well is hard.
<blockquote>Perhaps it's because you're looking at "Source Material" as the books or other fictional touchstones which inform your play? (After all, it sounds like your game is based on/in the Tolkien universe.) But, of course, this style of gaming can work just as well without a literary touchstone, in a universe created from scratch by the group, so I have to take "Source Material" to mean "the combined knowledge of the game we're playing right now, right here, and everything we have established so far in playing it together".</blockquote>
Again - the "Source Material" is the "Standard" referenced in jazz.  And, yes, the "source" does grow and evolve over time.  It must.  It is part of what the solos are adding to.  What was a solo in one game gets added to the "Standard" via the constrained and informed improvisational jazz process.  For the same reason I don't believe one can have such a game tabula rasa as one could not have jazz without its "Standard".  I suppose it's possible but where does one look to inform the play?  Where are the chords that the soloist needs to inform his/her play?  Where is the single, complete statement of the melody?<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay<br/><br/>Addendum -
<blockquote>If the +1 Strength on the sheet helps the group remember that, that's great, but to say it's important to the game in any way seems pretty misguided.</blockquote>
I'm completely adrift my this assertion.  First you make claims that you don't understand what we're doing and then comes this very definitive declaration of what is "wrong/bad" procedure or play.  I apologize for just pointing to an already written essay (linked above) but I hope having read it what I am trying (but failing to communicate) will make much more sense.  Just keep in mind that whatever transpires in play or at the table has many meanings not only in the present but many potential future one should someone find a way to work them in.  Are you hung up because the DM used a "+1" (semiotic) symbol shorthand that can and was interpreted in many ways?  This process of using a given symbol in many different ways is exactly what we want.                        </div>

All of those are very real possibilities, and quite possibly all of them will eventually be tried. I don't have enough monkeys or typewriters available to me , so I work with what I have! <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> <br/><br/>What I'm guessing is that all of the adult contacts that I'm going through to get this stuff to the test subjects will have some passing familiarity with RPGs. I'm also partly interested in what happens when say a lapsed RPGer gives this box to the test kids versus a friend who secondarily knew some gamers 3 to 4 decades ago and sat in on and observed a session once or twice. Basically, what gets created from a cargo cult method at a remove of two or so?<br/><br/><br/>Jeph: <br/><br/>My own Naïve RPG experience involved a kids' magazine article about D&amp;D* when I was in maybe third grade, a trailer for the Lord of the Rings cartoon, and a couple of CYOA books about a year or two later, and then, finally, a very confusing one session attempt at lunch by a friend to teach the game to me.<br/><br/>Since I couldn't seem to acquire the rulebooks, I wrote my own game on a school holiday break. I had all of about one 30 minute play session and maybe two looks at a rulebook at all prior to this.<br/><br/>That early game was somewhere between Monopoly and All-Spicy Dice All the Time, with a helping of Mother, May I ? thrown in.<br/><br/><br/>Later, we also did some outdoorsy style Naïve Gaming, but at that point I'd actually acquired a couple different rpgs.<br/><br/>Our naïve version of The Assassination Game ( being gamers now, but only having heard rough rumors of TAG) was actually pretty sophisticated a couple of years later.<br/><br/>*Naturally, that magazine article had pix, including a picture of a very nice Orc miniature. I think that alone made me forever more predisposed to look kindly on the use of minis in RPGs, even if we didn't use them almost alt all in practice.<br/> </div>

                            I wonder if Spicy Rolling is also somehow related to early random roll tables.<br/><br/>I mean, Spicy Roll results do remind me a bit of the fun of old D&amp;D Random Treasure Charts and Random Wandering Critter Charts. With those things 90% + of the entries are all foreseeable results.<br/><br/>But the you roll that one really whacky magic treasure,unexpectedly over-the-top Monty Haul hoard, or highly unlikely encounter by dungeon level ( Why exactly is there a White Dragon in your larder, Mr. Baggins?) and all of a sudden things get really interesting, really quick.<br/><br/>A spicy roll result that we remember does something very similar.<br/><br/>Also on a weird side note, I think Verdi is using what amounts to spicy rolls ( or at least something where mechanics are made on the fly with named possible outcomes stated just prior to a roll, much like what is discussed here) in the late 1800s in Kreigspiel.<br/><br/>Hard to get much more  simulationist than military training exercises.                        </div>

Are they?<br/><br/>Certainly there's a whole lot of stepping on up going on, but isn't one of the major goals to also expose the participants to the way the "world" works? World in this case meaning the military environments and situations they're likely to encounter as officers at a given level of command, in a given time period.<br/><br/>I would think that a commercial, hobby, wargame would be vastly more Gamist than an actual training exercise.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Jay,<br/><br/>I am getting the sense that - perhaps based on prior experiences, which would not surprise me in the least - you feel the need to "defend" your game and its practices against perceived slights or insulting points of view.<br/><br/>I want to say that this is not the case at all here - at least not from me, and I'm not seeing it from other posters. Clearly you've been participating in a really enjoyable and long-running game (which is an accomplishment by itself!), with skilled participants who bring a lot to the table. I see absolutely NO reason to doubt the success or quality of the game, since everything that's being reported about it is so positive.<br/><br/>I hope that helps put my comments in perspective at least a little bit. <br/><br/>For instance, I do not believe that calling something "freeform" means that it is simple or in any way unrefined. Rather, it just means that fewer parameters are defined or agreed-upon explicitly; instead, they are left to social and creative dynamics, whether conscious or unconscious. There can be tremendous complexity and skill involved in any freeform art or activity - no question.<br/><br/>I also have absolutely no intention of calling anything anyone's doing "wrong" or "bad"; if something I wrote reads like I am saying so, I apologize. <br/><br/>What I do find interesting is the mystique built up around this kind of activity/game/playstyle. Some aspects of it are very simple, and others are very involved or complex. <br/><br/>For instance, on my comments about "+1 to Strength"; of course it was meaningful to the group - it's a common touchpoint and serves as a shorthand. But it's also a subjective and, frankly, funny sort of shorthand. Or is there some reason why you feel it's important to the game?<br/><br/>Let me put it this way:<br/><br/>If you were teaching another group to play in this style, how important would you feel it would be to tell them, "...another important thing: make sure each character has a Strength rating. Occasionally, when things happen in play, have the GM adjust these on the character sheet"? On a list of important techniques for this type of gameplay, how high would that rate?<br/><br/>How would their game experience differ if you forgot to tell them that?<br/><br/>From a similar point of view, if one day a magic fairy came to your group's table and erased the Strength ratings on each character's sheet, how would your game differ, going forward? Would it be a meaningful difference?<br/><br/>How often does your group reference, look up, or in some way use these Strength ratings in play? How often does someone ask, "What's your Strength?", perform a procedure with the number, or something similar? <br/><br/>(I'm honestly curious. From what I've heard about the game so far, I cannot see how any of this would change the game; but perhaps there are other details which I'm not aware of.)<br/><br/>By the way:<br/><br/>The whole "jazz" analogy, I think, is more likely to lead us astray here than to be helpful. Not only am I not sure the analogy is being used accurately (although that wouldn't be a huge deal), but, more importantly, I have literally no idea what it is being used as an analogy for. What are the analogues of the terms you're using in your game - the "Standard", the "solo", the "statement of the melody", the "chords", and so on? (I have no idea! The analogy, at least to me, is doing more to obfuscate than to help. If you have specific things in mind and can describe them, though - again, specifics of the game itself, not specifics of jazz perormance - that would be fascinating and insightful, I think!)<br/><br/>For instance:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Again - the "Source Material" is the "Standard" referenced in jazz.  And, yes, the "source" does grow and evolve over time. </p></div></blockquote>
I have no idea what you mean here! What is the "Source Material"? How is it "referenced"? Can you give an example?<br/><br/>The best I can manage is some combination of established world facts (e.g. "Orcs are strong, but we now know that Beorn is stronger than most Orcs") and the aesthetic concerns of the group ("I see that Jay is really moved by stories of pity/the Middle-Earth aesthetic is often featured in stories about redemption, and we like those as a group, so I'll try to include more content like that, and support it when others introduce it"). Neither of those seem at all anything like a "Standard" song in jazz, note choice, music theory, or any of the rest - at least not in a way I can see, and we still haven't gotten to any practical examples.<br/><br/><i>*: As a total sidenote, in the jazz world there is also a wide spectrum between heavily notated - and, even, sometimes ENTIRELY notated! - music and completely freeform, improvised music.</i><br/><br/>Finally, where I might have a point of frustration with these discussions is that it feels, at times, more like a sales pitch than an explanation, demonstration, or discussion. Perhaps that's because, as I said, you may feel a need to "defend" its worth or value - that would be unfortunate, since I don't see any attacks being made, but I would not be surprised if there was a history of such slights which never entirely fade.<br/><br/>All I really know of the game at this point is how the dice are used (in some detail), that it's a long-running game set in Middle-Earth, and that it's emotionally meaningful to all the participants.<br/><br/>I found your comments - and, even more so, Jeph's comments - about the particulars of the dice and rolling *incredibly* interesting and helpful. (By "helpful" I mean that they could serve as a useful guide to someone trying to recreate this style of play and get some of the same benefits and features.)<br/><br/>That's what I would like to hear more about: the specific techniques, attitudes, procedures, and principles which bring the game to life and make it work consistently.<br/><br/>Breaking that down is no easy task, and sometimes examples are an easier way to go (then you can illustrate by example and let others do the analysis for you!), but, for me, at least, that's what I would love to see. If the same kind of attention and interest we've applied to the ritual of the d20 roll and its interpretation could be brought to other aspects of play, THAT would be an amazing discussion (and, eventually, resource).<br/><br/>(cont'd)<br/><br/> </div>

Are the rules of music theory "pretty vague"? No, of course not - there are a lot of specifics we can discuss, demonstrate, and identify in recorded examples.<br/><br/>I have no idea if that's the case in this style of roleplay, however - if the "rules" are not "pretty vague", that hasn't been demonstrated, discussed, or even illustrated. We've done a pretty good job of describing and illustrating how the "spicy die" rolls contribute to the game, and how they can be used, but, as far as I can see, have nothing at all on the larger format of play, what makes it work, or what makes it sustainable long-term.<br/><br/>That's the stuff I'd love to hear more about. If it's like music theory, ok, great - now let's talk about what that means, how chords are built, how note choice operates, all the details.<br/><br/>That's where I am coming from. No one is obliged to try to satisfy my curiosity, of course - but, if I could ask for something, that's what it would be.<br/><br/>My suspicion, based on experience with similar playstyles, is that the vast majority of that falls on the GM, who may have a systematic approach or may simply operate on finely-honed instincts, charisma, and a solid familiarity with the genre, story structure, and the psychology of the players. I'd be curious to hear whether that's the case here, too, or not.<br/><br/><br/> </div>

                            Paul, I don't think the jazz analogy is perfect, but I do think it's useful for the "structured improv with constraints from previous work" aspect.<br/><br/>Basically the combo of "Tolkein + the group's prior play" works to create a shared sense of expectations, boundaries, values, etc.  With that shared sense as the "standard", the group then strives to do with it exactly what many improv jazz groups do: play with it in an interesting and exciting way so as to balance fidelity &amp; novelty, skill &amp; inspiration.<br/><br/>The jazz metaphor is not exact, but I think as half of "semiotic jazz", it works.  The "semiotic" part, to me, communicates that we aren't emulating jazz improv in <i>all</i> ways, we're just doing something vaguely close in the pursuit of meaningfulness.<br/><br/>IMO, "So what makes play meaningful?" and "What does successful meaning-making play look like?" are the crucial questions to getting value out of the metaphor.  I have a vague sense of the answers there, but I'm not sure whether that's from something Jay's said or just my own instincts.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I'm on the same page as you, Dave. My interpretation of it is the same as yours.<br/><br/>When Silmenume responded, however, it sounded like he felt that was lacking, misguided, or otherwise not what he meant by the analogy. That's why I asked for clarification.<br/><br/>In a vague sense, the analogy is helpful. But when, in his response, he started talking about specific analogies from jazz (instead of talking about the roleplaying), I got worried that we were losing touch with the conversation itself. <br/><br/>We'll have to wait and see what he says, I suppose! I'm still quite interested to hear more about this game.<br/><br/>I've been watching a little bit of <i>Critical Role</i>, as well, and it's very interesting to consider how different (and how similar!) it would look if it were being played using a "Spicy Die Roll" method instead of the canonical 5th Edition D&amp;D rules.                        </div>

                            When you're getting all Spicy with die rolls, doesn't the system ostensibly being played act as part of the "source material"?<br/><br/>That's kinda why noting a +1 to strength noted on a character sheet actually does matter, right?<br/><br/><br/>We can still use a system to inform our play, even as we move further away from it in practice, going more and more spicy. Or maybe just use it from the get go with Spicy Dice, and the rule books more of color resource, cargo cult style.<br/><br/><br/>I mean, we still know that a character that we thought had a 16 strength ( and maybe what that means roughly in terms of carrying capacity, damage dealing, and dead lifting of weight) actually has a 17 strength ( better in all of those things) by that method, even if we never use any directly related mechanics from the rule book. We also know that an ogre with a 19 strength is stronger still.<br/><br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>

                            Re-reading some of those threads: No. That was definitively NOT a spicy game sans GM. But I can't shake the feeling that it's got a lot of similarities to Jay's Middle Earth game, despite all the manifest differences. EDIT: Maybe because it's got such strong "semiotic jazz" elements, even though the set of techniques used at Vincent and Meg and Emily's table has like zero overlap with the techniques used at Jay &amp; Cary's.                        </div>

                            Hi David,<br/><br/>Re - play unfolding in "complete ignorance" - <br/>If I've given that impression then I REALLY suck as a poster.  And I need to owe an apology to all here for my poor communication skills.  Of course play does not unfold in "complete ignorance".  Information is mostly, but not always, doled out as PC perceptions.  So as to your example "Am I close enough to grab something?" can be answered in any of a number of ways without resorting to TRUTHS.  FREX - "You're standing right next to it", or "Looks to be 30 to 50 feet away but it's hard to tell", or better "You've covered similar distances in the past but it will be a real effort to make it", or sometimes simply "roll".<br/><br/>I was talking to my DM today about theory and die rolling as he said something to me that totally floored me.  He said that for the old guard players that he frequently doesn't bother interpreting the roll as we players will frequently interpret the number ourselves.  IOW frequently we look at the number and immediately make an action based on our perception of what the number means to us.  If we roll poorly frequently we'll integrate some sort of assumption of lack of success and then attempt to correct for that immediately. Conversely if we roll a fairly high number we'll assume some degree of success and push forward with trying to accomplish our goal.  This is the "acting from confident deduction" that you mentioned in your post.<br/><br/>What happens is by allowing many, but not all, of "deductions" stand this reinforces our understanding of both "how the world works" (inductive logic) as well as our understanding of the situation (abductive logic).  On the other hand an incorrect "deduction" is not a game/meta fail as rather than breaking us out of the moment we double down by re-examining our abduction/induction cycle of logic and try to make another deduction and keep moving forward.  The bedrock assumption for this to work is that we don't come up to the social contract layer to say, "hey, you made a mistake" but we do what the bricoleurs do - you take the imperfect part (or the erroneous deduction) and you strive to make it work in game within the fictional world.  I'm not explaining this well, but Chris Lehrich did in the link I posted in above in my post to <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/478038/#Comment_478038" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a>.<br/><br/>Here is an example that unfortunately is vague as I read it long ago and I can't even off specifics but here it is.  I read about a fairly famous jazz drummer who had some sort of palsy that he was managing with medication.  However sometimes he would purposely take himself off his meds so that while drumming occasionally he would tic and strike his drum in a manner or a time that he didn't intend.  Rather than stopping and saying, "oops, sorry guys" he said this "error" forced him to really dig in and become extra creative to work that unintentional drum beat in so smoothly that a listener would have no idea that a "mistake" had happened.  So it is when we make "deductive errors."  As long as we are "right" most of the time, being "wrong" occasionally actually enhances the feeling of the fictional world - because we <i>work</i> to make it so.  Yes the occasional error crops up that can't be solved without breaking the fictional world and must surface all the way up to social contract level where we negotiate the error at the meta-level but the "guiding principle" is try and make the "errors" an example of the world working properly from within the fictional world (or the Shared Imagined Space).<br/><br/>I'm doing a terrible job of explaining myself here.  Let me leave a <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=14371.0" rel="nofollow">link here</a> about how Bricolage (by way of analogy) works specifically WRT role-playing games.  The 2 posts (especially the 2nd) explain how the process works and very emphatically demonstrates how system/mechanics do evolve during play.  In Sim play we not only use Bricolage (by way of analogy) but we promote it.  To quote Chris Lehrich directly from the linked posts above...
<blockquote>The GM, in such a formulation, is emphatically <i>not</i> merely an arbiter, the mechanics guy who decides the implications of a higher-level set of concerns to the lower-level specifics of the moment.  Rather, <b>the GM becomes a facilitator of ongoing bricolage.</b><br/><br/>Bolding added - Everyone who has an interest in this thread please, please, please do read the posts.</blockquote>
Dave, I apologize but I'm a bit swamped at the moment but I will address the rest of your questions as soon as I can.  I do hope after having read the link how you can see why I put mechanics into the pile of things that can be jazzed upon from within the SIS as opposed to talking about them at the meta-level.  It can happen and sometimes we must but we want to <i>prioritize</i> working within the shared imagined space.  To use Chris' emaple - the well engineered part while working admirably in the specific role it was designed for doesn't leave much left over to work with as a bricoleur.<br/><br/>Finally I should note that I have failed to disentangle the semiotic part from the jazz part of my thesis.  In short the semiotic side is the part I linked to but also includes the abductive, inductive, deductive logic cycle.  The jazz side (by analogy) is that part which informs the aesthetics and constrains the choices.  The semiotic side is the how and what were doing while the jazz side is why we're doing what we're doing (i.e., why we chose Middle Earth, FREX, and that which is about it that deeply resonates with in <i>our</i> group).<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

They are anything but.  They are Hardcore Gamist.<br/><br/></div></blockquote>
Are they?<br/><br/>Certainly there's a whole lot of stepping on up going on, but isn't one of the major goals to also expose the participants to the way the "world" works? World in this case meaning the military environments and situations they're likely to encounter as officers at a given level of command, in a given time period.<br/><br/>I would think that a commercial, hobby, wargame would be vastly more Gamist than an actual training exercise.<br/><br/></div></blockquote>
On the whole I would have to say that I am in the wrong for making such a call.  In truth I have no data from which to draw any sort of conclusion regarding what the "players" in the war game simulation were prioritizing and socially rewarding each other with.  I presumed the whole point was to work out "battlefield" strategies that would lead to victory in the real world but that description does not encompass what the participants were "enjoying."  I would have to wonder at some level if such an enterprise could even be considered a "story game/rpg" as I'm assuming there was no shared imagined space.  For me to try and categorize it by Creative Agenda might just be a category error.  The wrong tool for the wrong job, as it were.<br/>

Isn't that sort of a classic deflection of Step On Up style play, that you're not really "metagaming" because the character ostensibly shares the goal of succeeding by whatever means? I don't mean that to be critical, I think it's a really interesting question regarding Creative Agenda that arises in any sort of play where "challenge" is part of the fiction.                        </div>

In truth I have no data from which to draw any sort of conclusion regarding what the "players" in the war game simulation were prioritizing and socially rewarding each other with.  I presumed the whole point was to work out "battlefield" strategies that would lead to victory in the real world but that description does not encompass what the participants were "enjoying."  I would have to wonder at some level if such an enterprise could even be considered a "story game/rpg" as I'm assuming there was no shared imagined space.  For me to try and categorize it by Creative Agenda might just be a category error.  The wrong tool for the wrong job, as it were.</p></div></blockquote>
Isn't that sort of a classic deflection of Step On Up style play, that you're not really "metagaming" because the character ostensibly shares the goal of succeeding by whatever means? I don't mean that to be critical, I think it's a really interesting question regarding Creative Agenda that arises in any sort of play where "challenge" is part of the fiction.</div></blockquote>
It's also a bit of a trap to look at stuff that pre-dates RPGs as we know them and try to shoe-horn them in to CAs, but I still try anyway.<br/><br/>I was using the Verdi/Kriegspiel example because I'm pretty sure Verdi was running his scenarios using almost all ad hoc mechanics ( with a d6), stating stakes, using pre-existing data(*) and his own experiences, but also Spicy-rolling on the spot results for very high and low rolls. He was doing it in the 1800s, so at least some folks already understood the general technique.<br/><br/><br/>Is it Hardcore Gamist? Well yeah, but only as solidly supported by Sim. If there is some result of a roll, spicy or otherwise, that isn't consistent with reality ( source material) and training officer experience ( source material), then a Win based on that is no good.<br/><br/>Kinda like why Cadet Kirk sucks when he reprograms the Kobayashi Maru Scenario computers. He was going Hardcore Gamist without solid Sim support, therefore his result was illegitimate. A "loss" would have been solidly more legitimate of a win.<br/><br/><br/>(* similar to the way I was talking about using game mechanics as source material earlier, training officers at these late 1800s military schools would have huge amounts of data about all sorts of military related statistics. Ditto cadets. Free Kriegspiel, what Verdi was practicing, was about getting away from that data and letting the Ref use their own judgment to hopefully give far more accurate results, more quickly, and hopefully with more nuance)                        </div>

                            On a total side note, the games that immediately come to my mind when I think of using a game as the basis of play, including mechanics as inspirational source material and not much else ( and then going almost entirely to Spicy Rolls) are pretty much all of those first gen White Wolf World of Darkness games.<br/><br/>Heck I'm pretty sure they'd work better that way.<br/><br/>And, no, I don't mean that as a slam on their mechanics, either.<br/><br/>The writing in those games makes me feel like the designers really did mostly want Spicy Die mechanics, but felt beholden to the RPG buying public to just mash in semi-traditional mechanics.                        </div>

The bedrock assumption for this to work is that we don't come up to the social contract layer to say, "hey, you made a mistake" but we do what the bricoleurs do - you take the imperfect part (or the erroneous deduction) and you strive to make it work in game within the fictional world.

A concrete example of an incorrect deduction from your own play would be interesting.                        </div>

Going back to Chris Lehrich's posts this bricolage process analogy (aka mythic or ritual thinking) works by and among the relationships between "things."  In the example you helpfully provided above what you did was abstracted out of the "concrete".  I suppose it's a matter of technique but consider this in light of relationship between concrete objects.  Instead of a player asking how wide the chasm is (an abstraction and how the "engineer" might function the bricoleur might ask, "Have I ever leapt over anything this wide before." You see?  His question is one of relationships between his character (specifically his history and capabilities) and the chasm at hand.  So the effective player is staying within the Shared Imagined Space and has proactively started to gather information without abstracting to a higher level.  The DM rather than offering odds (which is an abstraction) might reply, "Yes, or so it seems, but it looks awfully dangerous."  Still within the SIS without abstracting upwards to chances or resolution mechanics.  The DM totally could abstract upwards towards resolution mechanics or offering odds for lots of reasons, but the decision to do so would be based on the table aesthetic and the accumulated circumstances.<br/><br/>But remember, for the most part we want to prioritize staying with the concrete.<br/><br/>So in the example I offered of the DM's response the player is left to deduce his chances, roughly, but also what the DM means by "dangerous."  Here, to me, the DM is offering a clue as to the "stakes" of failure.  What does "dangerous" mean to me?  Also why is the DM using the descriptor "dangerous"?  I pull on knowledge of the world, past and present, build up a case of facts (abduce) use my knowledge of how the world works (gravity will pull me down, smashing into rocks is potentially lethal - induction) to conclude that failure to succeed has a good chance in resulting in my character dying (deduction).  Now we add in the stakes.  I weigh my attachment to my character and the repercussions to the world should I die - say for example I am carrying a message of an assassination attempt on the son of Findulas, Boromir.  The loss of Boromir would have devastating effects on the "world" as, in the books, he was the military captain who kept Gondor from being over run for a good number of years.  It's the player who is grinding all this information though in a few seconds.  Do you see?  <br/><br/>It's not the DM telling the player the odds or the stakes but provides enough information in world for the player to start the abduction, induction, deduction cycle to try and formulate a plan of action based on concrete objects given him by the DM not based on abstractions.  Even the part about it being "dangerous" was couched in terms of perception - "looks dangerous" not the declarative statement "is dangerous"<br/><br/>So even though there is this time consuming exchange we really haven't left the game in progress as we played it all out through bricolage laying much of the onus on the player to fill in bit and pieces to paint a fuller picture.  And the kick is that we're not done!  The player could decide to ride on parallel to the chasm to see if there is a place where it narrows or perhaps becomes climbable or less deep.  Or the player may just say, "Screw it.  I never signed up for this mess (warning the Steward at risk to life and limb)" and let himself be captured and take his chances that way.  Or just forget the effort all together and seek an escape to personal safety, etc.<br/><br/>Let's say, on the other hand the player decides to try and make the jump and succeeds through some extraordinary rolls.  The DM narrates inside the SIS that the PC just barely manages to land on the other side but, in good cinematic tropes, he's just barely hanging on the crumbling ledge and needs to pulls himself up as he looks over his shoulder to see one of the bad guys unlimbering a bow.  As if things weren't bad enough!<br/><br/>Does this mean anything to you?<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            In reply to your latest response:<br/><br/>If you checked out my <a href="http://shrikedesign.com/games/delve/resolution.html" rel="nofollow">comics</a>, hopefully it was clear there that my group does the same thing you're advocating!  I don't consider measurements in feet or dice to be "best practice" -- I prefer character-POV descriptions from the GM, like "That looks tough to jump!"<br/><br/>The point of my "50/50 crapshoot" suggestion was not to <i>just</i> indicate a target number.  The point is to enable the player to make an informed character decision, <i>with an added bonus</i> of indicating a target number.*<br/><br/><b>Your example is actually almost in line with what I'm suggesting:</b><br/>Player: "Have I ever leapt over anything this wide before?" <br/>GM: "Yes, or so it seems."<br/><br/>My only gripe with that example is that <i>less</i> information is being communicated than the character has in that situation.<br/><br/><b>I would rather answer:</b><br/>GM: "You think so, most likely, but if so, it was right on the edge of your ability."<br/><br/>Why?  Because now the player knows they might or might not physically be able to jump that distance.  Beyond all the other considerations you listed -- basically, the <i>consequences</i> of failure -- I think the player should also know everything the character knows about the <i>odds</i> of failure.<br/><br/>If I hear, "Yes, or so it seems," I figure that my odds of failure, as apparent to my character, are 0%... but of course appearances can be deceiving.  So either (a) I should succeed in my jump without a roll, or (b) some new factors should arise once I make the attempt (like a hidden monster lunging out of the chasm).  <br/><br/>So that would be my interpretation, as a player.  Unfortunately, I am guessing that "apparently 0%" is <i>not</i> exactly what you intended to communicate in your example, and that my corresponding player expectations would thus be incorrect.<br/><br/>I think you and I <i>mostly</i> agree on how this communication should go.  I think the main difference is that I am putting more emphasis on the GM communicating odds to the player as clearly as the fictional environment would to the character.  I think that's really important!  I think it's worth an extra sentence or three in play when necessary.  And, if we could agree on it, I think it'd be worth putting in a "how to play Spicy" manual.<br/><br/>* <small>"50/50 crapshoot" is what I'd call an even-odds chance <i>in real life</i>.  I didn't intend to invoke dice mechanics with that phrasing.  Feel free to substitute in your own words for some endeavor you'd assess as even odds.</small> </div>

                            This conversation is now moving a little too quick for me to keep up, but I just wanted to say that I really like the, "Have I ever seen someone jump across a chasm this wide?" technique. Framing queries about the fiction as in-character points of view is a really cool thing to do (and sometimes I do so in my head, to give context to the information being discussed, even if I don't say it out loud).<br/><br/>I agree with Dave that it's less efficient and less clear in a lot of cases, but that's just a question of whether you value clarity of communication or "consistency of immersive communication" (just made that up; hope no one starts using such a clumsy phrase) more.<br/><br/>I can well imagine that a "Spicy Die" group full of players who are just enjoying thinking character-first and trust the GM might be happy not to know the odds (in fact, to know the odds less well than their characters!). But that's a question of taste.<br/><br/>Dave,<br/><br/>Throughout this thread, I've been thinking one question, which is:<br/><br/>"In what ways is this style of gameplay different from playing <i>Delve</i>?"<br/><br/>(<i>Delve</i> is Dave's immersion-friendly fantasy game.)<br/><br/>I suspect there are quite a few subtle points of difference (mostly on the GM's side, perhaps), but I doubt I could confidently say what they are.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear your thoughts on that! (Or some discussion with Dave and Jay to establish those things.)<br/><br/> </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> I'd say that immersion and conversational resolution are the primary overlaps, and that otherwise Delve and Spicy Middle Earth are quite different.<br/><br/>Delve arbitration is more consensus-led, as opposed to purely GM-led.  Delve only rolls to resolve uncertainty, not to add spice.  Delve's source material doesn't exist in popular fiction, and play isn't aimed at celebrating it.  I don't think Delve is a more semiotic-jazz-y RPG than most; agenda-wise, it's closer to OSR.

                            Oh, crap, you're right.  I didn't get us all the way to the roll.  How about this:<br/><br/>"I peer over the edge and try to judge if I could jump it."<br/>"You may have made jumps that far before, but if so, just barely!"<br/>"So I can probably make this, but I'd better not botch my leap?"<br/>"Yep!"<br/><br/>Now we're prepared for the GM to narrate something really bad on a 1, possibly something bad on a 2-5, and at least getting to other side alive otherwise.  (Assuming "botch" doesn't have a more specific meaning for this group.)<br/><br/>I time this exchange at 15 seconds.  Which is 13 seconds more than "Target number?"  "Six."  But it's 13 seconds still spent focused on the fiction, and it avoids that situation where the player rolls a 3 and the GM narrates failure and the player is shocked because they've made jumps that far before.<br/><br/>...although if the group has been playing together for long enough, "You've done it, but barely" may communicate "definitely don't roll a 1, probably don't roll a 2-5" all by itself.                        </div>

                            Hey David,<br/><br/>On the whole you have the right of it.  However I would argue a slightly different take on the die roll WRT the players "knowledge" of the odds.  Again I propose the die roll is presented as a cool opportunity for bricolage.  Due to long play at our table we have accumulated the "knowledge" that if the risk of failure was trivial the DM wouldn't call for a die roll in the first place.   The mere act of calling for a roll is a communications act to the player that what they are about to try to accomplish <i>is</i> risky.  IOW the chance for a "bad" outcome is fairly high or we wouldn't be rolling.  This puts the player into a "stressed" frame of mind which already means the player is invested into the outcome of "roll."  It's not just 1's or 20's that are significant as all the numbers on the die have their role (no pun intended) on a sliding scale.  However consider the following examples.  The player indicates that he's "going" to make the jump.  He rolls a '1' and he gasps at the certain disaster that is coming.  A seasoned player will very quickly attempt to add to the SIS to mitigate the "failure."  If the player can "pull something out of the shed" and cleverly bricole something into the SIS that is interesting, clever and exciting the DM will give him another roll to see if it works/enters the SIS.  Also consider that a '1' might mean the player makes his jump only to break his ankle on the landing.  Or perhaps he gets shot with an arrow spoiling the attempt before it starts and he's captured.<br/><br/>The die isn't just an impartial arbiter (and I know that you aren't saying that) but it helps signal a direction that the DM a bricoleur might take.  The die roll is not a task resolution device but a tool of the bricoleur and can act as in inspiration device or perhaps lend legitimacy to a direction the DM is considering (or both!).<br/><br/>Also consider that because a die roll isn't part of a task resolution that '1' isn't the last roll that player is going to make.  Quick thinking allows the play to attempt other actions as indicated above.  Rarely does a single "1" result in complete failure.  It means that events are going to turn radically against the player "in some way."  The DM may simply call for another roll to see "how bad that '1' is."  I've seen plenty of 1, 20, 1, 20 sequences that we all laugh at the DM because we know just how hard he's going to have work that out!  However if a player rolls a second or a third "1" in row now we're getting into lethal territory.<br/><br/>The dice push the bricoleur but don't dictate his choices.  So low numbers mean that something "undesired" is going to result but that doesn't close the issue.  The DM as a bricoleur (and bricolage <i>facilitator</i>!) wants to keep the process on going so narrates a result where the player might have leapt across but didn't make the far ledge but instead is hanging by his fingertips on a rocky outcrop that is starting to pull loose from the wall and he's taken significant damage.  A middling roll could indicate a better success and the character might have landed half on the edge and half off, taken some minor damage and maybe loses his sword.  A higher number might mean the player succeeds but now has to contend with arrows flying at him.  A "20" might mean that the character makes the jump so cleanly they might get a check in Strength, Dex or Agility.  Or the character lands, rolls up looks behind him and catches the eyes of the leader "bad guy".  Perhaps he's so stunned by the amazing feat that he's slacked jawed for a moment giving the seasoned player the opening to flee out of bowshot before the arrows start falling.  Or perhaps the leader "bad guy" and the PC share a moment and the leader "bad guy" subtly nods his head in what appears to be acknowledgement of such daring and skill and orders his men to ride around the chasm as opposed to having his men pepper the PC with arrows.<br/><br/>The key to making these events "meaningful" is for the DM to create as many opportunities for the player to engage in bricolage as possible.  As a DM, to facilitate the players bricoling efforts, you want to give them answers/opportunities that leave room for them to bricole.  This is why something like TN's typically work against this process.  They lead to absolutes - or to use Chris Lehrich's example, the perfectly engineered "heating coil" response that doesn't promote further bricolage as opposed to using the imperfect "clothes iron" or "toaster" response which leads to further bricoling opportunities.
<blockquote>That sounds perfectly doable to me... although it's harder with a die roll. Without a roll, the GM and player would never know they disagreed on the odds; the player could just assume something very unlikely happened. But if they roll a 10 and get something out of the blue, now they know they acted under incorrect impressions.</blockquote>
There is nothing wrong with acting under incorrect assumptions in bricolage.  In point of fact as per Chris' posts such errors are very easily corrected via bricolage.  And by "tweaking across" to a solution as opposed to abstracting upward to design a whole new rule during play it reinforces the whole structure of signs and meanings by showing that it has always worked but we just missed the error before.<br/><br/>In our game this propensity for incorrect assumptions to arise is central to play.  On one level this allows for some sense of mystery in the game as we try and figure where we (as opposed to the DM) went wrong in our logic cycle.  We also explicitly state to new players that there will be "fog of war".  Just as in real life we have to make decisions with varying degrees of stakes with incomplete information <i>all the time</i>.  This most certainly is not a bug but a feature of bricolage.  Dealing with the <i>Incorrect Assumptions</i> only serves, in the end, to reinforce the "reality" (or rather the solidity of the created reality) of the game.<br/><br/>David, on the whole, I believe we're pretty close in understanding each other in what we're discussing.  I think that what differences we have may just be chalked up to style and differences in group dynamics.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            That's definitely a possibility!<br/><br/>Another thing to consider is that having the die there - that "10" result showing us that maybe our expectations don't align - can actually help clarify communication over time. <br/><br/>I think that the communication style you're describing (which is concerned with careful decision-making and clarity of information) is quite different from Spicy Die play - at least some that I've seen. Speed, intuition (unconscious, spontaneous decision-making), unpredictability, and maintaining a certain tempo at the table (which includes cutting out "out of character" talk altogether, sometimes) can be high priorities in this style of play.<br/><br/>I think that, "You need to roll a 6" is the clearest and most efficient way of communicating.<br/><br/>"Just say what you do and roll the die! I'll tell you what happens" is the least clear - but it's fast and powerful. <br/><br/>Your approach tries to marry the two (clarity, yes, but also trying to stay "in the fiction"), but at the cost of speed of delivery.<br/><br/>I can imagine that a group like Jay's might be playing the game on a long enough timeframe that getting all this right immediately or in the first session isn't imporant - hey, you'll figure it out over time, as you get to know the GM, the world, and the subtler dynamics of the group. (As a few people have pointed out, audience reactions can also be significant here: if everyone looks scared after a roll, the GM will likely take that into account, whether consciously or not.)                        </div>

The short answer is, yes, we do use HP.<br/><br/>The longer and more nuanced answer is, of course(!), more involved.  I'll start off by stating that it isn't perfect, it has it problems, but works well enough.  First our HP system is broken into two parts that we call Stamina and PBP (Pure Body Points).  Stamina is something that "represents" all those intangibles that occur when going up "levels."  Your character's ability to endure more that life throws at them as they become more "experienced."  This handles most "blunt" force trauma and the character's endurance.  Running a long period of time results in a temporary loss of stamina as does losing sleep or going hungry.  PBP was originally born out of the DM's desire to make players really fear knife fights and arrow shots.  It has change some since its inceptions to no one's surprise (right?).  PBP is supposed to represent your physicality, your flesh.  It does not change with levels and is influenced by Con, height, weight and if you're an Elf or Dwarf.  As indicated above knife damage and most piercing weapons bypass Stamina and directly affect PBP.  Armor, which is pretty rare, reduces the damage applied by its own value (vanilla chain absorbs 12 damage and has an arrow rating of 6) if it covers the area struck.  Also for every PBP point of damage taken you lose your level times damage so even a high level character doesn't want to take PBP damage.  At "0" PBP the limb is no long usable.  If its the head at "0" you lose consciousness while chest and abdomen at "0" leave the character incapacitated.  If you go below zero you're "bleeding out" and if you go negative of the PBP value in any body area you die. (Say you have 5 PBP in the arm, if you go to -5 you've bled out).<br/><br/>In most circumstances "damage" is applied to Stamina so higher level characters and special races tend to do better in battle or facing other physical trauma.  When you get to zero stamina any further damage is applied to PBP (less any armor protections).  You also get penalties applied to just about any die roll.<br/><br/>Now this all sounds very, very much against everything i've been talking about...and it would be if we followed these "mechanics" in a deterministic fashion.  Primarily this whole system is used as a referent signifying the state of you character's "health" and more importantly as a means to increase tension (i.e., my stamina's getting "low" so I have to start figuring out how to put an end to this combat by coming up with a quick victory, fleeing, negotiating a cessation of hostilities, etc.)<br/><br/>Instead of thinking of deterministic values think more along the lines of a "danger meter."  If our stamina goes to "0" we're in trouble.  If we're losing PBP we are in "immediate peril."  The actual mechanics sit in the background and are used mostly as referent to "inform" us of our in game status.  This "shorthand" also serves especially well during combat as that is handled in "real time" so keeping track of your characters status is extremely difficult given that your are using all your brain power fighting for your life.  Literally we standing at the table with The Last of Mohicans playing (Elk Hunt - danger, or worse, Massacre/Canoes - lines are collapsing or the wall's been breached) swinging our imaginary swords, ducking and weaving, trying to make use of the terrain, keeping track of what's happening to other players and NPC's as well as developments regarding the bad guys actions, rolling your own dice, etc.  Its extremely hectic and stressful.  Having a handy reminder of your characters health status is extremely useful as a quick touch stone.<br/><br/>Does that help?
<blockquote>It would be tremendously helpful for me (bit I think for others) if you could present us a (hypotetical) actual conversation between a GM and two players to show how spicy roll and actual bricolage really works. Especially the 'we did not roll any 1s or 20s' part!</blockquote>
I will, but give me sometime to either recall or generate an example.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            My group used to do something similar to Spicy Die when we played DnD (but with a very transparent "dice rolls do not mean anything, and this is an agreed upon social contract" sort of way). We handled HP as just being totally non-canon. We took out death rules and took HP as nothing but a game mechanic. If I were to try to put it to representing something, it would probably be best defined as something like fighting spirit. (Our play is and always has been very very anime-influenced, with combat segments emulating shounen anime combat). So essentially HP was just a vague resource that when it ran out, a particular character was removed from the specific fight until someone did something to bring them back in. <br/>With enemies, this often equated to running away or teleporting out or some other non-mechanical escape method. With PCs, this was typically either unconsciousness or just a vague "defeated" where they're still up, but can't do combat stuff or take actions like in a lot of anime when a character is taken out of a fight but is still standing on the sidelines talking and being panned over to regularly in moments that really emphasized how much the remaining combatants were fighting for their defeated friends. The whole friendship-is-power moment. <br/>At the end of a fight, HP was restored to full, and if anyone wanted to play out injuries, that was done without mechanics. They would still be mechanically at full health, but would play up an injury in their "downtime" scenes (which were 90% of our play).<br/><br/>That being said, dissatisfaction with this method because of the fact that we weren't really engaging with the game and would have had a better time just playing the stories we told in DnD freeform instead led us to abandon that whole method and instead search for games that actually suited the play we wanted (which is what led us to CMWGE).                        </div>

                            I agree that you last post, Jay, was particularly clear and illuminating. <br/><br/>I wouldn't have thought that "every die roll indicates a stressful situation" would be a principle for a game like this, for example, so it's cool to see it stated explicitly. <br/><br/>On a side note, this part is really interesting:

                            I think the role of incorrect assumptions depends largely on two things:<br/>- Whether the fictional world is set in stone in the GM's mind, or whether it's malleable and the GM adjusts to player assumptions.<br/>- Whether takebacks are allowed when a player announces an action that then turns out to not make sense after the situation is more fully communicated.<br/><br/>If the world is set in stone and there are no takebacks, than incorrect assumptions must be avoided at all costs.  Otherwise, s'all good, I guess.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I find that forming an intention in-character to do a thing, thinking I'm informed, and <i>then</i> finding out I had the wrong impression, breaks me out of character identification.  So that isn't my favorite approach for immersive play.  But perhaps the other stuff Jay's group is doing either avoids this or just makes it no big deal.                        </div>

Definitely. It was extremely helpful for me, thank you for your detailed answer. Your openness and responsibleness about our inquiry is a huge contribution to the topic.<br/><br/>What I see now is that our previous model of your game style ('principled freeform plus') was misleading a bit. I think a lot of us initially understood 'spicy roll' as a waaay more informal thing, which takes book rules only as inspirations to the fiction so to speak.<br/><br/>Right now it looks like to me that the situation is more complex. It is not that you dont really use 'book rules', it is that your attitude toward rules are not as strict as an engineer would take his tools ('as specific things for a particular function'), because you are not designers but bricoleurs. Maybe you look at rules in a more laxed way, you treat them as guidlines or 'toys' (my jargon), things to refer to when needed and things which can be put in the corner if they are in the way of fun. Am I closer now to the truth?<br/><br/>If yes, is it possible to make generalizations about how much you lean on for example the rules (and not rolls!) for PBP damage during gaming? All the time? 50%? 33% Less?<br/><br/>Also, if you can really afford to write us an actual play example some time, could you please include parts where 'incorrect assumption' and 'taking pbp damage' happens?                        </div>

No.  As I understand it my DM had only played TSR's D&amp;D or AD&amp;D when he set about developing his new system for play.  He's never played (or read) any other system.  While one can see strong influences from those sources he worked hard to make a system that reflected what he felt represented how Middle Earth worked with a dash of Epic Heroic thrown in.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

Maybe?  The rock bottom reason of the more overt and structured use of direct mechanics is <i>trust</i>.  The DM <i>could</i> run combat without referencing all the above mechanics but given that death is real and irreversible in the game he fully realizes that one those occasions when a character does die it helps prevent bruised feelings and possible recriminations.  You know, <i>trust</i>.  It's a concession to human nature.  It also helps because it is speedy as Paul_T seems fixated on <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> , yet also note that there are times when the combat is so intense, so fast paced and first person that the DM and the player stop rolling dice altogether as they mime their combat.<br/><br/>I should note that we play a folio of characters and some are quite literally decades old and quite powerful, have survived some amazing events and typically at this level are deep in the councils of the wise WRT to struggle against Sauron.  The loss of a character can end said player's involvement for the night.  It's not that the DM can't work in another character in a pretty short time but the loss is that emotionally staggering.  It's understood and allowances are made if the player chooses to pack it up for the night.  To some it might seem harsh that such traumatic events occur in play but the flip of such events is the much more frequent elation at surviving deadly combats.  These (admittedly infrequent) deaths actually give surviving combat that much more juice.  No one likes losing a character but it does make for a much more intense gaming experience knowing that death can come and it's for real.  Sort of like the difference between no stakes poker and betting your house.  It <b>changes</b> the game.<br/><br/>Again, for all the "employment of rules" they are not used in a strictly deterministic fashion.  Even in heated combat die numbers are a dial suggesting degree of success or lack thereof.  Sometimes the DM will roll a die to get a "sense" of the fight.  Sometimes a roll of a D20 will not only indicate a hit but how much damage is suggested.  I've also seen damage revised down from a value that would have been a lethal blow upon hearing such from a player to a merely crippling blow.  One time a player had just finished rolling up a brand new character for the night and play had just begun when the DM called for the table to roll.  Said player rolled a "1" so was asked to roll again.  By the end the player had rolled 4 "1's" in a row - the result?  The character was narrated to have had a heart attack and died.  No PBP. No Stamina.  No rules.<br/><br/>I'm guessing at motives here but my thoughts are that the DM tries to get the PC's close to the possibility of death in most combats and hold them there maximizing both dramatic impetus as well as keeping players on tenterhooks.  A dramatic technique if your will in keeping in line with the books overall theme of individuals fighting (nearly) impossible odds in the hopes of finding victory.<br/><br/>I know I haven't directly addressed your question regarding how often or how closely we hew to the stamina/PBP system but in short I'll answer both frequently and rarely.  That whole system while appearing deterministic is in reality a dramatic tool that has consequences.  I apologize I haven't given a clearer answer right now but I'm stressing my 4 brains cells at present.  I will return with more to say soon!  I hope what little I've offered has shed some light.  It is complicated but then so can bricolage...<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

I find it really interesting that you guys do character death in that style. Not wanting character death was, for my group, pretty much the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> reason why we adopted the style. <br/>We explicitly didn't want for stakes to feel "real", and didn't want for combat to be "intense" or a survival trial or whatever. <br/>"Real", "intense", and filled with stakes were exactly the opposite of the feeling that we wanted from combat, because realistically what we wanted was mechanization of dramaturgical structure without any mechanization of outcomes and the like, but at the time we didn't at all realize that was an option, so we were basically trying to remove the more traditionally game-y stuff and make it so that all decisions on outcomes were based on what made the most sense as far as the dramaturgy. Which outcomes led the best towards our planned storyline, and eliminating options that could be problematic as far as expressing our story.<br/><br/>Which like, I suppose that distinction is why we abandoned the style when we found diceless, GMless storygames that primarily mechanize dramaturgical structure and that don't mechanize outcomes at all, whereas you guys are still interested in the style.<br/><br/>I just find it really interesting to see how stuff diverges as far as similar style for extremely different artistic goals. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

And I'm pretty sure that Ron was not right about this style being fundamentally broken.<br/><br/>From a GM's POV using 'book rules' in lethal situations to avert personal responsibility and retain group trust is a logical step.<br/><br/>Your attitude seem to match <a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a> idea about <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/360" rel="nofollow">Rules vs Vigorous Creative Agreement</a>.
<blockquote><br/>the purpose of an rpg's rules is to create the unwelcome and the unwanted in the game's fiction. The reason to play by rules is because you want the unwelcome and the unwanted - you want things that no vigorous creative agreement would ever create. And it's not that you want one person's wanted, welcome vision to win out over another's - that's weak sauce. (*) No, what you want are outcomes that upset every single person at the table. You want things that if you hadn't agreed to abide by the rules' results, you would reject.</blockquote>
Maybe the case is that this original 'spicy roll' play is not really different from what Vincent described in the link above.<br/>1. Mostly it is a 'principled freeform plus' with a lot of 'non deterministic' (i would say 'augural') rolls which add spice to the game. The results helps to bricolage fiction.<br/>2. Sometimes, when the situation is lethal, rules are used for the unwanted and the unwelcome.<br/>3. There is a strong trust in the GMs competencies. The fluctuation between 1 or 2 is not based on some formal procedure or group concensus, but on his choice. He uses these decisions to steer forward intense situations, 'maximizing both dramatic impetus as well as keeping players on tenterhooks.'<br/><br/>(Only the third is surprising for my collaborative indie brain!)<br/><br/>I think you need to be both very assertive and pressing but also empathetic to succesfully create these rollercoster experiences for your players. I great skill I should improve!<br/> </div>

                            When I ran a dozen or so sessions of spicy play, I used damage rolls for exactly the reasons you describe <a href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">@hamnacb</a> : to disclaim responsibility and build credibility.<br/><br/>Whenever a character would be injured, I'd tell them the number of (exploding) damage dice: 1/2d6 for minor injuries, 1d6 for most solid strikes with a deadly weapon, 2d6 for probably crippling, 3d6 for very likely lethal.<br/><br/>The process leading up dealing damage, and decision for how many dice, was pretty fuzzy... but once you get to that point, you as a player know that if total damage accrued &lt; your hit points, your character is still alive and in play.<br/><br/>(This system was induced from the knowledge that damage rolls existed in Jay's game, but that's about it... cool to finally get more information about how the process worked at the table!)<br/><br/>I always want to compare this technique to *World-style "Inflict harm as established".<br/><br/>In my game, I also used another "disclaim responsibility" mechanic: <b>saving throws</b> against fixed target numbers that were pre-calculated for each character. I'd sometimes call for a save against Dread, Hesitation, or Trauma to see if characters would freeze up, react too slowly, or be incapacitated by wounds. Like with damage, the table knew that saves sorta... carried extra constraints on interpretation? Spicy principles still operate, but tightly bounded by the framework of "you are able to act freely if and only if you roll at least X on the d20."<br/><br/>(And the player's thinking would be "I failed my save against Hesitation, darn!" instead of "Jeff just decided by fiat that I was too slow to act, what a jerk".)<br/><br/>On another note, I was <i>just</i> re-reading Vincent's posts on how he wants rules that create unwanted outcomes a few days ago, in light of this Spicy discussion. I think I totally agree with your conclusions.                        </div>

                            Yeah, stakes and costs created by rules mandates definitely have some advantages over stakes and costs created by other participants.  A genuinely undesirable cost at stake is a great example.  I couldn't get my head around Vincent's phrasing, but I did eventually get his point.<br/><br/>An impartial OSR ref can definitely inflict certain kinds of unwelcome outcomes on their own (without rules), due to the responsibilities of the their role and the authority granted them by the group.  So it wouldn't have surprised me if Cary's niche in Spicy Middle Earth were similar.  But "leave hits and damage to the rules" makes sense to me too.<br/><br/>"I just decided that you lost your sword and are dangling from a cliff" is one level of authority/responsibility/trust, but "I just decided that you're dead" is a whole other one.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Indeed. Dave, I know you've given that phenomenon a lot of thought. <br/><br/>I think that there are lots of ways to make that more palatable, and I would think a major one is warning about stakes and dangers ahead of time, so the player can buy into them instead of being surprised. (For instance, if we say, "Do you really want to fight him? No one has ever fought him and lived..." that sets entirely different expectations, and helps "set the scene", so to speak, for the possibility of character death.)<br/><br/>What other techniques help?                        </div>

To the best of my understanding and what has been relayed to me by others Ron never understood Sim, never really cared to try to understand Sim and seriously doubted it even functioned as a coherent Creative Agenda.  My understanding of the "constructive denial" formulation was that it was his take on players actively/constructively "denying" that they were in fact <i>not expressing a Creative Agenda <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at all</span>.</i>  Period.  Dead stop.<br/><br/>He didn't have the tools or academic framework to parse Sim and it left him bored.  Chris Lehrich did have the tools to dissect what was going on between the players but the Theory Boards were shut down not long after Narrativism was pinned down.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to bag on Ron nor do I want a thread about The Forge, but I want to make clear that I don't think Ron makes a good authority to reference re the Sim play process.  Everything useful that I've drawn from as a resource to discuss about what is going on in Sim play has come Chris Lehrich's posts/essays.                         </div>

                            Perhaps. There was a period, towards the end, where Ron was exploring Sim play quite heavily, and excited about a number of "Sim-supporting" games, like <i>Dead of Night</i>. There was a lot of rigorous and serious discussion on the subject. Lots of other people have successfully applied Sim theory to gaming (see Eero's recent threads about his Prydain campaign, for instance, which is very deliberately an attempt at conscious Sim play in line with those Forge concepts, and is, by all accounts, so successful<br/>that it even attracts observers (an audience) on a regular basis.<br/><br/>More interesting, though, to me, is how well your descriptions here line up with those essays Ron wrote!<br/><br/>I have no particular stake in whether it's correct or not (I don't consider Ron's ideas on roleplaying to be in any way prescriptive for play), but it's a striking similarity or parallel. What you're describing sounds exactly like what Ron described as Sim play, at least to the best of my knowledge (I never got as in depth on that subject as did some others, like <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a>, so anyone can feel free to correct me). <br/><br/>In any case, the similarities in concept and description are striking!<br/><br/><i>(Edit: I'm responding to Jay here, not David - cross-posted.)</i> </div>

I think this an area worth talking about.  For myself, I make deductive errors in real life <i>all the time</i>!  In the movies we watch our heros make deductive errors all the time.  Its part of the unravelling of the story and allows for plot twist and turns.  Thus I'm having a little trouble understanding why it's such a deal breaker for your roleplaying experience.  Obviously it's important to you, I'd just like to learn more as to why.  Maybe it's just a matter of you and I not communicating what we mean effectively or maybe its a real phenomena?
<blockquote>- Whether the fictional world is set in stone in the GM's mind, or whether it's malleable and the GM adjusts to player assumptions...</blockquote>
I hope my emergency post on player <i>deductions</i> and <i>assumptions</i> helped clarify this.  I should note that the "fictional world" must be as open to bricolage as anything else in the game or the result will be player deprotagonization.  In our game some of the major NPC's of the books are already dead including Halbared, Elladan and Elrohir while Saruman was exposed as a traitor while at meeting of the White Council (its important because Orthanc is now up for up grabs among other matters and the Wise are working very feverishly to make sure he doesn't get back in.)  Also a dragon smashed Rivendale (it wasn't completely destroyed but the damage was extensive and thus as a seat of Power it was severely diminished).  One of the players had set into motion events that led to the Lonely Mountain Dwarves and Thranduil's Elves taking the field against each other.
<blockquote>If the world is set in stone and there are no takebacks, than incorrect assumptions must be avoided at all costs.</blockquote>
Again, the manner in which bricolage works, at least as described in tribal societies demands that there are no takebacks.  But as what we are doing is roleplay not setting the foundations of an explanatory worldview we do have some room to wiggle.  In most cases where the stakes are small the error of deduction is left in play and we work with it just as would in real life.  OTOH if an "established fact" was held in error by the DM we will correct.  In the first case the error is limited to the character.  People make mistakes, characters make mistakes.  Not so terrible.  If the DM makes a mistake about the world (that includes your character) serious disruptive discontinuities can result and shatter the fictional reality.  Point in fact we have to stop bricoling and abstract upward all the way up to the Social Contract level to sort out the problem.  That's a Big Problem.  So one can see, that on the whole, the idea of "no takebacks" forces the players to pay attention and think carefully.  This necessity to "pay attention and think carefully" really pushes the player to dive deeply into the fictional reality which usually leads to an alternate sense of reality sometimes confusingly called "immersion."<br/><br/>On a side note even Tolkien, when finding he made some world error, would typically leave the error in and work to make it function within his writings.  To use Chris' example he'd find a way to counter that balloon lifting the machine off the ground rather than removing the balloon.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            A take on Spicy Middle Earth in PbtA-speak:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>if the risk of failure was trivial the DM wouldn't call for a die roll in the first place.<br/>. . . <br/>The die roll is not a task resolution device but a tool of the bricoleur and can act as in inspiration device or perhaps lend legitimacy to a direction the DM is considering (or both!).<br/>. . . <br/>The DM as a bricoleur (and bricolage <i>facilitator</i>!) wants to keep the process on going . . . to facilitate the players bricoling efforts, you want to give them answers/opportunities that leave room for them to bricole.</p></div></blockquote>These are some of our agendas and principles.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> • the player might have leapt across but didn't make the far ledge but instead is hanging by his fingertips on a rocky outcrop that is starting to pull loose from the wall<br/> • he's taken significant damage<br/> • the character might have landed half on the edge and half off<br/> • taken some minor damage<br/> • loses his sword<br/> • has to contend with arrows flying at him<br/> • get a check in Strength, Dex or Agility<br/> • [the "bad guy" is] so stunned by the amazing feat that he's slacked jawed for a moment <br/> • the leader "bad guy" and the PC share a moment and the leader "bad guy" subtly nods his head in what appears to be acknowledgement of such daring and skill and orders his men to ride around the chasm as opposed to having his men pepper the PC with arrows</p></div></blockquote>These are MC moves of various types.<br/><br/>If I wanted to pass this system along to others (with just a few tweaks to increase replicability), I might present them with this text:
<h1>GM Agenda:</h1>
 • maximize opportunities for bricolage
<h1>GM Best Practices:</h1>
 • only call for rolls when there's a non-trivial risk of meaningful failure<br/> • if a player wants to add on to their action which prompted a roll, let them speak before you do<br/> • use die rolls for inspiration (or to lend legitimacy to a direction you already favored)<br/> • use Moves lists for further inspiration if needed<br/> • before the die is rolled, have a general idea (such as a specific Moves list) of what an average result (roll of 10 or 11) would be; once the die is rolled, adjust accordingly
<h1>Moves Lists:</h1>
<h2>Fatal Moves</h2> - use these moves, or something similarly bad, when a player rolls badly after already falling into a terrible situation (e.g. from previous bad rolls)<br/> • permanently disfigure them<br/> • take away their most prized possession(s) forever<br/> • kill them
<h2>Hard Moves</h2> - use these moves, or something similarly bad, when a player rolls badly and/or the situation is already dire<br/> • inflict significant damage<br/> • put them in a situation that will quickly get worse if not addressed<br/> • put them at someone's mercy<br/> • separate the party<br/> • take away their stuff
<h2>Complicating Moves</h2> - use these moves, or something similarly complicating, when the roll and/or situation suggests a middling result<br/> • put them in a dangerous situation<br/> • block their resources<br/> • inflict minor damage<br/> • move to attack them<br/> • also use a Hard Move<br/> • also use a Success Move
<h2>Success Moves</h2> - use these moves, or something similarly rewarding, when a player rolls well in a situation in which they can flat-out succeed<br/> • they impress someone with their skill or daring<br/> • they spot an opportunity<br/> • they achieve their objective, but discover a complication<br/> • they almost achieve their objective, with one obstacle remaining
<h2>Triumph Moves</h2> - use these moves, or something similarly rewarding, when a player rolls very well in an advantageous situation (or a 20 in a more neutral situation)<br/> • they completely awe someone with their skill or daring<br/> • they completely achieve their objective, and minimize any subsequent risk of losing it<br/> • they increase the score of the skill or ability they just used<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>

Right on!  The neat idea of thinking of Sim as bricolage by analogy or Semiotic Jazz as a descriptor of what drives us to play the way we do is that the improvisational jazz descriptor already includes the idea that the group is going to play what it finds aesthetically pleasing.  IOW - you do you!<br/><br/>In my case the source material and its theme of struggle against overwhelming odds appealed to us players as a story so we want to experience the same in our game.  Seems you took what you liked from your source material and made it work in your particular game.  Yay!  It only serves to shore up the idea that Sim is a diverse healthy and engaging style of play that taylors itself to each groups aesthetic sensibilities.<br/><br/>Thanks for sharing your style of play and how successful it is!<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">@Silmenume</a> re: "set in stone" and takebacks, I think my word choice was confusing.  By "the fictional world" I meant "the particulars of the characters' immediate environment, which informs their decisions".<br/><br/>As long as the players are bothering to attempt deductions (rather than just assuming, as you clarified), and the GM is responsive to their queries, then I'm reasonably confident that Big Problem errors will be rare.<br/><br/>The GM forgetting an important detail about the fictional world is a great example of a Big Problem, but not the one I had in mind.<br/><br/>The Big Problem error I was asking about was more like when a player decides to leap a chasm because they failed to first ascertain that it was too wide to leap.  If there are no takebacks, then your character commits a nonsensical action and the fiction-in-the-moment is broken.<br/><br/>There are a million ways to avoid that; I was just wondering which one(s) you use.<br/><br/>My solution is twofold: players, clarify the relevant details before taking action; GM, assume all characters are not morons, so stop players who are acting in obvious ignorance.  I am getting the vague impression that your group has something fairly similar...?                        </div>

                            Dave,<br/><br/>I think that AW-like formulation is quite good in many respects, except for two things:<br/><br/>* It doesn't particularly touch on what makes the game GOOD (especially, for example, what the players do). That's OK, because I don't think you were trying to include that yet, anyway.<br/><br/>* I see some contradiction here:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/><br/></p><h1>GM Best Practices:</h1>
 • only call for rolls when there's a non-trivial risk of meaningful failure<br/>[and] <br/>• use die rolls for inspiration (or to lend legitimacy to a direction you already favored)<br/></div></blockquote>
In particular, Jay writes "if the risk of failure was trivial the DM wouldn't call for a die roll in the first place", but <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/477856/#Comment_477856" rel="nofollow">Jeph's post lists a number of reasons to roll</a> which do not necessarily carry significant risk of failure.<br/><br/>My impression has been that calling for rolls is part of the GM's skill in this style of play, and it can be used in a whole variety of ways.<br/><br/>For example, would this be acceptable in this style?<br/><br/>"You three are going to spend three days relaxing in the village before moving on? Ok, Jay, roll a d20 to see how that goes."<br/><br/>The GM is just fishing for some momentary inspiration before summarizing the events of the week, and there's little to go on, so he asks for a roll.<br/><br/>Is that kind of thing part of play for either of you?<br/><br/>(I've occasionally used "the Dice of Fate" for this kind of thing, as in my game <i>The Bureau</i>, and it can be handy to "colour" play one way or another, almost like <i>Swords Without Master's</i> "tone dice" - is this narration gloomy or upbeat?)                        </div>

                            Paul, you're correct, I do not claim that my post constitutes a full game.  <img alt=":tongue:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":tongue:"/><br/><br/>As for risk of failure, I think it's a wording issue for which I failed to nail the nuances.  The idea isn't "roll every time a PC might lose, and only then".  The idea is more "when a PC tries to do a thing, don't make them roll if nothing's at stake".  The "roll" I refer to in my brainstorm is the roll triggered by PC action, not a random weather or wandering monster roll or some of the other stuff on Jeph's list.  That other stuff would require a separate piece of GM advice.  Feel free to write one!                        </div>

                            Right. There is a variety of applications of rolling the dice here. In a more procedural system, we might have two (or more) different types of rolls, perhaps differentiated by using different dice:<br/><br/>* The d20 roll for high-stakes character challenge moments.<br/>* A d6 roll for general "I wonder how it's going" or flavour rolls.<br/><br/>However, in "Spicy Die" play, my impression is that blurring that line is actually useful as a tool to give the GM the ability to be flexible and to surprise the players. Making it somewhat opaque plays into the strengths of the game (so, for instance, you can generate tension or fear in the players, just a little, even when the roll might not, in fact, carry any danger).<br/><br/>I'll be curious to hear from Jay and Jeph to see how much of this aligns with their experiences, and whether they differ on this point.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> I think that's an awesome first step and jumping off point. Like, if you hand a sheet of printer paper with those bullet points and a d20 to a table, they can totally play a Spicy game.<br/><br/>I think there are just a few missing things to make this a functional minimalist game:
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>A mechanism for disclaiming responsibility where the bounds of trust begin to fray, eg codified damage rules.</li>
<li>1s and 20s, or whatever the equivalent is with your dice mechanic. It seems a recurring theme that these are really important opportunities to bring specific techniques to bear; they're qualitatively different from "fatal moves" or "triumph moves".</li>
<li>"Only call for rolls when there's a non-trivial risk of meaningful failure" doesn't seem to capture the full breadth of rollable situations. What about pacing? What about fishing? What about ritual/signaling? Maybe, "Only call for a roll when something exciting and unexpected might happen." <small>(Which is to say, only roll when a 1 or 20 won't make you go "...the heck do I do with this?" and stall out.)</small></li>
<li>Grounding. The standard we're all riffing on. A starting point to get us all on the same page. Something as simple as, "Choose your favorite setting and system. Make characters like you normally would, then throw away the rulebook."</li>

Yeah, that's exactly where I'm coming from on this, as well. (ref. my comments, above)<br/><br/>That seems like a great shorthand explanation of this approach.<br/> </div>

                            That's a pretty interesting question. I think that the GM's role - and the player roles! - are quite different in that style of play. However, the methods of Spicy Die rolls could be used in a "princess play" style, why not? It just requires a certain orientation from the group.<br/><br/>It might be tricky to pull off, though.                        </div>

                            The really short version is, it's play that focuses on relishing in your character. AFAIK the term was coined by Eero (at least, he's the one who uses it the most); it's basically like childhood pretending to be a princess, but for more than just princesses.                        </div>

                            I don't think it's ever meant to be negative.<br/><br/>Just got coined as a phrase that reads like the writer is being dismissive unless you know the background.

                            The reason I asked about the relation between princess play and spicy roll is because while they are two, clearly different things, my mind instantly tied them together.<br/><br/>1. Princess players need rules to fancy their characters and make them shine.<br/>2. So it seems that it is very easy for them to use the spicy dice rolls as an inspiration for the fiction, of course only if<br/>A. they retain the rights of interpreting and narrating the outcomes, or<br/>B. the GM is able to never break their vision of their character.<br/><br/>3. Some unwanted (1s) results could be still ok, if it means that my character got captured so I can show off my coolness in the prison and break out.<br/><br/>4. Swords without Master is maybe the best spicy roll princess play rpg ever! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Hearing more and more description of what qualifies as Princess Play, I'm starting to think that Princess Play is 100% what I do.<br/>Because like, rules focusing on the importance of the individual characters are something big I look for in rules. Retaining rights of narration and interpretation for everything your character does is absolutely essential to me, which is a big part of why I dislike dice and mechanical generation of outcomes and the like, and the possibility of a GM breaking someone's vision of their character is one of the several big reasons why my group's play doesn't use a GM.                        </div>

Personally, I see the use of both <i>Toy</i> and <i>Princess Play</i>  as reclamation/rehabilitation of the terms.<br/><br/><i>Oh, it's a toy? Yes well it's a fucking awesome toy, one that I have and you don't.<br/></i><br/><br/><br/>At the same time, if you like this kind of stuff, it's a self-reminder not to take the stuff overly-seriously. Yes, analyze it, try to find ways to make it work better more easily, but never lose sight of the fact that yeah, at the end of the day, it is Play Pretend and it is actually really damn fun.                        </div>

                            Hey David,
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">@Silmenume</a> re: "set in stone" and takebacks, I think my word choice was confusing.  By "the fictional world" I meant "the particulars of the characters' immediate environment, which informs their decisions".<br/><br/>As long as the players are bothering to attempt deductions (rather than just assuming, as you clarified), and the GM is responsive to their queries, then I'm reasonably confident that Big Problem errors will be rare.</p></div></blockquote>
...and you're right!  They are comparatively rare.  When were on a roll and playing regularly such Big Problem errors are infrequent however, when starting up play after a fairly lengthy hiatus the Big Problem errors do crop up (relatively) more often.  This, to me, is suggestive that there is a certain perishable skill involved in what we're doing.  I don't know if it is something as simple as Paying Attention (memory) or something more involved (like bricoling skills).
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The Big Problem error I was asking about was more like when a player decides to leap a chasm because they failed to first ascertain that it was too wide to leap.  If there are no takebacks, then your character commits a nonsensical action and the fiction-in-the-moment is broken.</p></div></blockquote>
Boy, oh boy.  You sure ask the involved questions!  As usual I'm not even sure where to start so forgive me if I wander far afield.  The first thing to keep in mind about such things as the proposed chasm is that it is not a fixed reality when presented to the player(s).  To key understanding such a "concrete object" is its relationship to the character (or party).  It is a "test" of the player's ability to contend with the "obstacle."  So the dimensions of the chasm are set in such a way as to be an obstacle (or a boon if the player is creative, quick thinking and just a bit lucky.)  IOW it will always be <i>difficult </i>no matter the character.  However even this assertion isn't always strictly true, for an elf may be able to leap the chasm with ease but rather the difficulty for the player of the elf lies in what to do for the rest of the party.<br/><br/>So, "the point" of the chasm is to test the players ability to think under pressure.  If no effort is made in game by a seasoned player to "solve the problem of the chasm" or said seasoned player wasn't paying attention then woe unto said player and their character.  A new player at the table is spoon fed more clues and is given more time to "address the chasm" with the likely possibility that the consequences for failure might be less.  A seasoned player is expected to know to "address the chasm".  This "expectation to know to address" is one of the metrics we use in determining if a player is a good fit for our table.  If, after the "honeymoon" period, a new playing just isn't picking up on the "assertive deductive style" then they we let them go.  We don't try to be rude about it and we make it clear that our particular style of play isn't for everyone.  OTOH a player who can't think quickly, decided quickly, deduce effectively, isn't creative really, <i>really</i> drags the enjoyability of the play session down.<br/><br/>So in short, if the seasoned player fails to engage he gets what's coming to him.  We have high expectations of each other to keep the game up to standards that we all want in order to enjoy the game.  This is part of the incentive to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pay Attention</span>!  It's not the DM's job to spoon feed us or to hold our hand for us in the game.  We understand (and demand of each other) that we are expected to play by making the very best effort we can.  Lack of effort is an affront to the other players who are working very hard to make the best possible gaming experience they can.<br/><br/>Thus if a seasoned player makes such a basic mistake as to not "ascertain" information about the chasm or perhaps better stated "does not engage with the chasm" then too bad.  Said player failed to keep up their end of the Social Contract.  <br/><br/>I will say, though, that the DM almost always drops a clue about the "chasm" so we are rarely (though not always) given some subtle information or intuition about the problem before we have to make a choice.<br/><br/>I'm running out of gas here, so if you have further questions feel free to ask.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">@Silmenume</a> This "perishable skill" is fine tuned communication I'd say : non verbal hints, a way of cueing intent, MO, likelihood of success and consequences, without committing to a number... yet. I think this is why Paul_T kept coming back on the "it takes time" point. If you want to make explicit the algorithm of mutual acquisition, all the fine grain bits of communication at the table, you lose the kind of (sorry, it's so trendy I can't resist) "swarm behaviour" this communication must be to mesh the procedures into smooth play. Sorry this is full of lame analogy, I can only hope this makes sense to you. In this sense, the illustration could require a camera and microphone.                        </div>

Coming from my experience I would definitely think so.  Over the course of many conversations I've had with my DM about the genesis of his style of play he's spoken many times of sitting at the table playing watching the other players gauging what it was exactly they responded to and what flopped.  He intuited that he wanted to create an emotionally powerful experience for the <i>player</i> via the in game process.  As the DM himself had always enjoyed action movies (plus his love of the LOTR books) that he wanted to DM a game that was both "muscular" and really "pushed" the players to be emotionally engaged.  Lots of this came about from his intuited ability to "read" people in general.  To put it rather poorly he knew "how to push people's buttons."<br/><br/>For all the typing I've engaged in about bricolage and Semiotic Jazz and the tendency of the process to push people into a first person perspective he never lost sight it was the players he was trying to create a real emotional response.  So in creating the events in game he would do so in such a way that was specifically tailored to each specific player at the table.<br/><br/>My DM believes it was his role-playing that lead him to screenwriting.  Yes he spent lots of time watching and researching the process but the foundations of manipulating an audience he learned from his work to become what he help was the best DM possible.<br/><br/>Real short - While this is a heuristic and doesn't apply all the time, the premier guiding principle for generating and running a game is simple scenario, complex NPC's.  To work the NPC's need to connect to the players powerfully/emotionally via their characters.  It works.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

You are definitely right, Paul (and <a href="/forums/profile/hamnacb%29">@hamnacb)</a>.  I'm not good a creating such examples whole cloth so give me a little while to see what I can come up with.  I'd give a direct example from play but the DM's been busy with his movie since March and for the example to work we'll all need the little details that get forgotten by those of us (me!) who have poor memories.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Your comments on the GM's attempt to connect with the players emotionally is a huge part of this type of play, I think, and something we haven't discussed at all yet, but, I think, a really significant feature of play in this style.

That's the problem, though.  I can't (at present) remember any event where a seasoned player has blundered to so badly as to completely fail to engage the setting (the chasm - FREX).<br/><br/>We did have one player for a long time who has since moved away who would take greater risks fairly often and his dice would back him up to an astonishing degree.  He succeeded at some pretty awesome things.<br/><br/>We were playing somewhere in the deep south of Middle Earth.  Further than the southern border of the Far Harad.  We used this area for a game experience that was less about the struggle with Sauron and more about conventional "dungeon crawls/murder hobos".  The scenario was a port over from an school Star Trek episode where a being (a wizard in our iteration) ruled this ancient town and formented violence between two bands of barbarians every night and then healing them the next morning.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Two of the PC were a Tarzan type and the other was an elf who didn't know he was an elf.  We go through one cycle when we discovered that this was a perpetual trap.  We set off looking for what we deduced was some sort of magic using individual and so we went looking for the highest tower we could find.<br/><br/>Night was coming on when we found it and the two PC clambered up the side at an astonishing rate.  The elf reached to top first and the DM had only just started describing "a wizened man with a staff point..." when said player shouted I jump off the tower.  The player rolled a "20" while a lightning bolt crackled just past his chest as he was propelling himself off the tower.  He did not enquire about what might be below him that he could use to either control his fall or what he might aim to land on.<br/><br/>He was an elf.  He was highish level (10th?).  He made a deduction about the intentions of the "wizened man" before the DM even finished describing him and took decisive action.  He rolled that "20".  We had only the roughest idea of the height of tower because of the time it took to climb it.  The tower was later estimated to be about 70-100 feet high after the game.<br/><br/>The elf?  He landed safely on his feet.  The table cheered!<br/><br/>This doesn't answer what happens when a seasoned player fails to engage but it sort of illuminates when a player takes a calculated risk - death by magic or possible death by falling an unspecified but suspected distance.<br/><br/>I hope this helps a little.  I'm still trying to remember a total failure to engage "the chasm" type of an event by a seasoned player.  I will say it is very, very rare.  Part of this stems from the Social Contract layer understanding that the DM only paints a partial picture and its the player duty and responsibility to paint in the rest through play (mostly "confident deductions").  To fail to engage is akin to "fail to play".  That is <i>what we do</i>.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

A poor roll would probably have meant a bad landing.  The player's quick thinking/decisive action and the fact he was an elf would <i>probably</i> have been sufficient for him to dodge the lightning bolt.  If he rolled a "1" I don't know if his character would have been fried by the lightning outright (because he's an elf) but he would have been close enough to death that additional rolls and more input by the player would have been required to see if he survived.<br/><br/>As far as recalling that particular circumstances with a poor role as an example of proper play would depend on a number of factors.  It was a very high risk choice.  If said player made those types of high risk choices before hearing the DM out <i>all the time</i> (especially when the stakes weren't that dire) then I would probably not think it proper play.  If a player "always" relied on their dice to get them out of difficult situations (even if they rolled consistently well) then I wouldn't really classify it as proper or good play.  While this player tended to have good rolling he also tended to play "heroically", decisively, intelligently and creatively.  He tended to made interesting things happen in play.<br/><br/>It's very difficult to call out a single instance of play and then pass judgment on it in isolation.  There are many factors that need to be considered both in game and out.  Is the player a one trick pony?  Does the player get by on dumb luck?  Or does the player frequently make good deductions?  Does the player interact with the NPC's well and in an interesting manner.  What kinds of decisions does the player make in the Kobayahi Marus that pop up frequently?  Does the player play his characters in a manner that reflects the themes we are jazzing on at the table?
<blockquote>Also, is announcing your action quickly and without hesitation considered a virtue at your table? Is that part of being a good player?</blockquote>
Almost always.  One of the axioms at our table is, "Speed Kills."  The corollary is that <i>fast thinking saves lives</i> (frequently your own!).  During the training period of a perspective player we also tell them the old military saw, "Any decision is better than no decision."  The DM does not stop time when events are moving rapidly to allow a player to sit and reflect.  The idea (at our table) is to put the pressure on and keep it on.  I should note that the pressure isn't max all game (usually) but rather builds to a peak through the night.  We are pushed to near our limits during play and this is the primary ingredient of what makes the game so white knuckled.  We're not there to sit back and pass the time amicably but instead ride the knife's edge of our abilities as players.  You can juggle rubber balls easily? Great!  Now juggle glass spheres.  Got that?  Good.  Trying juggling nitroglycerine.  Etc.  No resting on past laurels.  Always seek to improve our play.
<blockquote>If he (as the player) had hesitated, would his character (the elf) been more likely to get fried by lightning?</blockquote>
Absolutely.
<blockquote>Finally, examples of seasoned players failing may be difficult to think of, but examples of the players who "didn't work out" might be easier and just as instructive. Perhaps you can think of a few of those?</blockquote>
I'm still working on this but I'm minded to say that this usually happens on a "plot" level rather than a tactical level.  However, I'll offer another example of "good" as opposed to "didn't deduce properly" play.  Long ago another player was playing an elf being pursued by a gaggle of orcs. I remember he wasn't well armed - maybe a knife and a bow.  The problem was that the orcs did have at least one archer and knife work would have been very, very dangerous.  Though he had a bow the character was out of arrows.  So he turned to a tree and sang an arrow from the tree.  He had no such skill on his sheet to match this and no one had even done that before in the history of the game.  The player, under heavy pressure, had the presence of mind to put forth a new skill as if it had already existed by considering the totality of what he knew and suspected of the gifts of the elves (the logic cycle I've harped on) and <i>without</i> asking the DM if he could do it or not he made the assertion that he was going to sing an arrow from a tree.<br/><br/>He rolled well enough, though I suspect that too may have been a particularly spicy roll as the DM was very impressed with this action that I believe he would have allowed it to succeed, and was rewarded with an arrow.  This is an example of <i>very</i> good play.  He proposed a new aspect about elves through direct action.  The "world" grew a little bit larger and richer by that act....and to be honest it was pretty cool.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            As a sidenote I talked with two friends about spicy roll and one of them made an interesting remark. He thinks it is the opposite of illusionism.<br/><br/>Both styles depend on GMs fiat a lot. The difference is that in high stake situations illusionism suggests you to fudge results if needed, and spicy roll tells you to disclaim responsibility by sticking to the rolls!                        </div>

                            Jay,<br/><br/>Great examples! Glad to see that my hunch about the pace of play being important was correct (and that may explain a lot of your differences in opinion here with David, perhaps).<br/><br/>I would still really like to hear some examples of "failure cases". It's great to hear about awesome moments of play - it sounds like a really exciting game, and those examples give us a good idea of what the game is like at its best. Awesome stuff!<br/><br/>However, looking at cases where things went *wrong* is a much better way to really understand the processes of the game: how things actually work. That's when the "guts" of the process are laid bare to examination, so to speak. I hope you can think of one or two!<br/><br/><br/>hamnacb,<br/><br/>That doesn't sound quite right to me. It seems to me that Spicy Die play is very much an Illusionism-facilitating technique. It doesn't *have* to be used that way, of course, but the similarity has to do with the opacity of stakes. (For instance, consider Jay's example, above: the GM would probably have "allowed" the arrow-singing feat to work regardless of the roll, which is exactly how a lot of Illusionist play operates.) Calling it 'the opposite' is quite a stretch, although it is also possible to play it with a "play to find out" mentality. <br/><br/>My experience with this kind of gaming (I've run a lot of games in something like this style in the past) is that there is sufficient GM control, even when trying to "leave it to the dice", that over the long term this turns into a very GM-controlled endeavour.<br/><br/>The GM might not even be trying to engineer a particular storyline (I wasn't!), but over time every little decision being in the GM's hands means that the long-term outcome averages out to "exactly what the GM expected". (While any given roll might be a surprise, the average outcome is "exactly what you expected", and the "you" in that sentence means "the GM".)<br/><br/>For me, that's what led me to abandoning that style of GMing. It worked great on almost every level, but I got tired of there being relatively few surprises. (Again, in the short term lots of cool stuff - like that arrow trick - happens, but in the long term the players have little enough input that the final result is "basically something like the story I expected". Here's a thought experiment: you're the GM, and you set up a situation where some Orcs are coming to fight an army of humans. You've decided that the Orcs outnumber the humans and have no fear: you've thought about it, and, in your mind, the likely outcome is defeat for the human army. You're open to other things happening, but that's the baseline you're operating from. Well, there may be occasional variations and surprises, but, if there are 20 rolls made in the process of resolving that situation, it will average out to "what you expected": the Orcs win the battle. Eventually, the game can become predictable - very rarely do the humans win, to continue the example. This is great if the GM is interested in telling her own story and having the players participate in it, and occasionally surprise her. But, for me, that wasn't enough - I wanted that excitement I get when reading a book and I'm turning the page, and anything could happen.)                        </div>

                            I feel like what hamnacb's getting at is this:<br/><br/>There are two common "fudging" techniques in Illusionist play. In one, the GM rolls secretly, sees something she doesn't like, and lies to the group about the die roll in order to justify a desired result. In another, the GM rolls openly or has a player roll openly without announcing the target number, sees a result she doesn't like, and lies about the target number in order to justify a desired result.<br/><br/>In spicy play, we NEVER roll secretly, and there's no target number to lie about (except for in rare cases where the target number is extremely explicit—"Don't roll a 3 or less"). You can't fudge; there is nothing <i>to</i> fudge. If the GM gives narration that clearly doesn't fit with the outcome of a roll, she loses trust and authority.<br/><br/>Spice is fudge-proof.<br/><br/>That's not to say there aren't a ton of other classically illusionist GM-force techniques that spicy play supports extremely well, though. In particular, "roll until you succeed/fail," fishing (holding a desired result up your sleeve until you see a die roll that justifies inserting it into the narrative), and all roads leading to Rome (always nudging things back towards the same ultimate destination, regardless of the journey).                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">@hamnacb</a>, <br/><br/>An interesting remark, but it also seems to me (and I could very well be wrong) to demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the DM between Sim and...and I don't know what other CA the friend of your was referencing.  I'm not trying to bag on your friend on any level but the statement, on face value, presumes the primary role of a DM as a neutral arbiter of task resolution.<br/><br/>By its very nature, in Sim, the DM's role is to facilitate bricolage.  Using the Semiotic Jazz model the DM is most definitely not an outside objective judge but is as deeply enmeshed in the creation of the jazz solos as the players are.  Not only is it impossible to be objective as part of a jazz performance the mere idea of "objectivity" in jazz doesn't even make sense.  What you want in a DM jazz soloist is a person who doesn't put his solo efforts first.  He's there to help the other soloists but his solos <i>must</i> adhere to what's going on within the ensemble as a whole.<br/><br/>Yet, I will say that because of the intimate involvement of the DM to the activity of play that yes it helps to have a mechanism in place to help players cope with unpleasant outcomes.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            I'm not sure I follow this line of reasoning about Illusionism being distinct.<br/><br/>Sure, I understand that, if the dice are out in the open, there's no fudging the <i>roll itself</i>.<br/><br/>But, the title of the thread is "When the die roll does NOT determine what happens" (i.e. the GM does, or some for of bricolage does). And the most recent example in Jay's post tells us that "the GM would probably have the attempt succeed, regardless of the outcome of  the roll".<br/><br/>To me, that's... well, maybe it's not 100% Illusionism, but it's at least 90% Illusionism, isn't it? <br/><br/>There may be a difference in motive or aims (for instance, the GM might not be planning a specific storyline, and probably isn't, from what I've heard), but the step-by-step process of play sounds like it's more or less the same thing.<br/><br/>In fact, I'd argue that the whole POINT of the Spicy Roll technique is to give the GM the freedom to impose his/her vision on every moment of play instead of being held accountable to the group for a specific outcome.<br/><br/>For instance, I can imagine, on a really bad roll, the GM saying that "yes, you manage to craft an arrow out of the tree, but before you can reach for it, the Orcs are all around you!", or some such. This is exactly how Illusionism functions in a task resolution system, as well - they're kissing cousins, at least, it seems to me. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Paul, I'd say the main difference is that Spicy gets there hygienically while much Illusionism does not.<br/><br/>There may also be a different level of GM buy-in to letting extreme rolls change their plans.                        </div>

I'm with you on that.  ...and please don't think that I'm trying to dodge your entreaties.  I'm having a difficult time trying to fix where in the process of bricolage where "things went wrong" because to the scientific western mind (as I understand Chris' description of Claude Levi Strauss' writings) bricolage is always "error" prone.  Every added piece always introduces its own problems but that's a <i>feature</i>, not a bug.<br/><br/>We've had problems with new players just not being able to handle the <i>apparent</i> openness (lack of deterministic mechanics which give cues as to what the player is supposed to be doing in game) and flail to the point of being utterly ineffective.  We've had players come in with the idea that they are effectively immortal because of previous game experiences with their "adventuring parties" and the "DM's prefab story."  That never ended well.  We've had players freeze up/shut down down due to the overwhelming pressures of the game (FREX - the player we thought might have been heading into stroke territory).  We've had players who just didn't grok to the "rules" of the world and just kept dying.  We've had players who just didn't understand the "themes" of the world and that created all sorts of disharmony.<br/><br/>There's been lots of times where we as players failed to deduce events properly and came to erroneous conclusions about the "big picture".  IOW abductive failures.<br/><br/>If you could give me an example of what you think might constitute a breakdown or failure of this mode of play that might help.  As seen above there are lots of instances with breakdown at the Big Problem level with new players and lots of failures to logic correctly on the Major Event Level by the seasoned players.  Anything you can do to help me understand what exactly it is you're looking for would be deeply appreciated.  I apologize for my posting shortcomings until then.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>,<br/><br/>I will reply at length as soon as I can, but I believe you are making a fundamental error.  There is NO task resolution in Sim play.  Think on Chris Lehrich's "Shadows in the Fog" game.  They use Tarot cards to explicitly call the players to cleverly bricole to the event they are trying to accomplish.  The mere employment of a die roll is <i>not</i> automatically an instance of task resolution as the players are not risking their esteem among their peers at the table besting a <i>challenge</i> - Gamism.<br/><br/>The die, as we employ it, could very well be those Tarot cards.  Dice are less openly explicit in their role as a means to encourage players to bricole but they do function the same way.  The dice are not used to determine whether you succeed or not because it is not a matter of "esteem/Step on Up" but rather to point the way to the various problems that using this "toaster or clothes iron" could bring to the constructed machine.<br/><br/>Until this distinction is understood then all we're doing is talking in circles.  I can understand all the baggage that most players bring when it comes to employment of a die (that's Claude Levi Strauss working for you! - and by extension bricolage) but in the end we (and I mean our table) use the die for ritual reasons as much as any other.  IOW dice have always been a part of "roleplaying" so we'll use dice too - but its not strictly necessary.<br/><br/>The reason why the DM <i>probably</i> would have let the player succeed at the singing of the arrow from the tree irrespective of the die roll was because the player had bricoled so <i>beautifully and perfectly</i>.  It was not because the DM had some story agenda he was attempting to stick to.  <br/><br/><i>Bricolage trumps die rolls</i> because die rolls do not determine success or failure per say, but rather point to the unwanted side effects of the bricoling effort.  FREX is the iron so heavy that the machine begins to collapse under its own weight?  The player now has to deal with that "problem".  But sometimes the bricoling effort is so "aesthetically pleasing", so "clever" that the effort succeeds without a new problem being introduce to the machine.  In this instance die roll is used for "dramatic purposes" which meshes in very tightly with the DM wanting to create the most emotionally intense play experience he can <i>for the players</i>.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay<br/><br/>Addenda - In these perfect moments of bricoling the die is not only used for dramatic purposes it is also used in a ritualistic manner as a "seal" on the event.  The number rolled isn't used to point to possible complications but rather to point to perfection.  Roll a "20"?  Super awesome!  A capstone to a perfect effort.  Roll a "1" - fate and something else cool might yet come of this from an unexpected direction.  A capstone to a perfect effort.                        </div>

                            Jay,<br/><br/>I'm entirely with you on that last point.<br/><br/>I'm just looking at it the other way around: the Illusionist GM in the task resolution game who does the "you're surrounded by Orcs" thing is doing Spicy Die bricolage in a task resolution game. She's not doing real task resolution either!<br/><br/>Using the dice as Spicy Rolls instead of task resolution is a common Illusionist technique, in other words.<br/><br/>As Dave points out, what *may* separate Illusionism from Spicy Die play is entirely a question of how much commitment the GM has to certain outcomes. (And how that's communicated to the players, or not.)<br/><br/>In my experience, that's a fairly thin line (and can shift from moment to moment - e.g. in that instance, the GM loved the "arrow singing" idea so much he well go with it, regardless of the roll, but in that next scene he may entirely unsure until we roll the dice and he gauges the players' reaction to it).<br/><br/>My point is that those two approaches to play share a lot more with each other than, say, a Burning Wheel game run by the book.<br/><br/>If your GM decides that in the next session he really wants this cool thing to happen, and then does, you can't really tell. (e.g. Did those Orcs catch me because I rolled low, or because that's what the GM has been planning for since two sessions ago? Good luck figuring that out.)<br/><br/>The motives may be different (which is a meaningful thing!) but the process of getting there is more or less exactly the same. An outside observer merely watching the game would have a really hard time distinguishing one from the other.                        </div>

Those are brilliant! Exactly what I'm curious about. <br/><br/>If you could describe an instance of some of these from your game (especially 1, 4, and 6, but ideally all six!), that would be the best answer I could possible hope for!<br/><br/>Fantastic. What a great list!                        </div>

                            Yeah, good questions.<br/><br/>It sounds like the group does a lot of fast-paced, intense play (e.g. if you, the player, don't make a decision fast enough, your character can die), acting things out physically, and so on. That's my best guess so far! That could be stressful, I'd imagine.<br/><br/>I'm also curious about (6)-class failures. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            I thinking timing is one of the great underexplored topics in experiential roleplay.<br/><br/>There's a huge difference between:

                            I'd consider that one of the "performance" aspects of play, just like whether we act out our characters (and put on their mannerisms and voices), engage in heavy description, make sound effects, dim the lights, and so forth.<br/><br/>Another variation is whether, in a rules-heavy game, you're allowed to take time to look up a rule, or not. (e.g. "Sorry, if you don't know how that spell works, you can't use it now.")<br/><br/>Would you agree?<br/><br/>Those things sure matter a great deal! But they're not structurally important in the way, say, reward cycles are. Kind of like how atmosphere and presentation matter a great deal to your enjoyment of a meal, but doesn't change its nutritional content.<br/><br/>I've always found it pretty interesting that, in "before the Forge" times (to use a shorthand), the majority of RPG discussions were about such things (at least, when they weren't about rules/mechanics and adventure design). For instance, I remember "how to be a good GM" articles being all about stuff like this in the 90's: how to do good accents for your NPCs, what kind of props to use at the table, how to use timers to put pressure on the players, how to modulate your voice to keep people's attention, and so forth. The sort of timing concern you're talking about here was a common point of discussion, at least the way I remember things. That WAS good GMing and good play, in a sense.<br/><br/>During the "Forge times", at least for the people heavily involved in that scene, those things took a back seat to structural game design, communication about in-game events, social contract, and other, less ephemeral and more structural concerns. More nutritional content and less presentation and garnish, in a sense.<br/><br/>I always found it interesting how one tended to push the other out (or so it seems, in a way). Obviously, they're both very important, but sort of in different ways.<br/><br/>Some things also fall into a sort of middle ground, like spotlight concerns. (Who's getting to talk when, and who's in the center of attention?)<br/><br/>It's interesting to think about.<br/><br/>Jay, does your group lean very heavily on those "performative" aspects of the game, for its impact and power? I get the impression that you do, and a lot, but I'm not exactly sure how much.<br/><br/> </div>

                            OK - here goes<br/><br/>1.  In our particular instance of play NPC's are HUGE to the game.  Though the players are important because without them there is no game we play such that our characters are enmeshed in a world that is moving and progressing whether their character is doing anything or not.  Our characters are not the center of the game's universe and the corollary to that is that there are NPC's who are very important to the world.  Also while the vast majority of NPC's though not movers and shakers they are all individuals who have their own needs, wants and fears.  Time waits on no PC, so if a player wants to be a part of this living, breathing, evolving world then they are going to have to make themselves be a part of said world.  For brand new players the DM will take care to make their character especially interesting as well as richly connecting them to NPC's.  Finally he will usually gin up a drive or two (kickers) to give the player an initial impetus.  The attempt here is to connect the player via their character to the world.  But some players never seem to come to the understanding that it is their responsibility to self-motivate as opposed to just follow the DM "story".  <br/><br/>There it is - some players, for whatever reasons, never seem to be able to grasp the idea that they are not passive recipients of the DM's story and its up to the players to get involved.  This doesn't mean the DM hasn't put events into play, mostly via NPC's with their own agendas who are putting them into action, but rather the DM doesn't have a fixed story he's dragging the players through.  The town might be under attack but it's up to the player to decide <i>if</i> and in <i>what manner</i> to get involved (or not - say, by running away - but still making a choice and acting on said choice).<br/><br/>2.  I was told of an occasion where a brand new player for reasons I don't know spit on an NPC dwarf.  The DM glared at the player wide eyed, mimed lifting his arms like he was raising a handle (say on a large two headed battle axe) and smote down on the player/character.  The DM did not speak but nor did he move quickly so the player had plenty of time to react - he did not.  The DM pronounced the character dead and the player complained that, "You can't kill me!  I'm a PC!  What about your story?!"  His complaint was not about how the event unfolded but rather the player should have had a privileged role in the world.<br/><br/>3.  This typically happens when the pacing is picking up and the new player either can't keep up or they "feel" as if they have no options and jam.  Referencing back to the new player who the DM legitimately became concerned over his health (worrying that the new player might stroke out because his face flushed so purple and veins were popping out on his head!) said scenario was set on an island that was overrun with ghouls.  The ghouls could not abide daylight so the party went to work building a small palisade to ride out the night.  The new player got separated from the party and by the time he realized nightfall was imminent it was too late to let him into the palisade.  There was no gate to open nor rope to lower down and there was not enough time to remove a few timber and replace them as the ghouls were already on the move.  The new player begged entrance but nobody would let him in because it would have been certain death for everyone.  As the DM described the sounds of the ghouls coming and the sun light dimming the new player just froze and his face got redder and redder as the description kept coming on.  He didn't try to run or climb another three or anything...he just...jammed and his blood pressure rocketed with his stress levels as he <i>felt</i> he was helpless waiting for certain death.  The key here was while he may not have had great options, he did have options but couldn't think due to pressure of the running clock.<br/><br/>I will post 4 - 6 as soon as I can!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> - you are correct!

                            Lots of interesting stuff here to react to! Two specific points:<br/><br/>1) Regarding the phenomenon of sessions that turn out basically the way the GM expected: One of the ways I sort of check myself for "hygienic" GMing practices is to look back after a session and make sure that it could very well have gone differently, based on some combination of die rolls and player choices. Especially if the session did, in fact, unfold along the most obvious / predictable lines.<br/><br/>2) Regarding players who "freeze" under pressure: I've been encountering this a lot lately. I have one friend with ADHD who often does not react well to these situations, and she can be tough to challenge and is left feeling frustrated often. She definitely wants games with real meaningful choices and consequences, hates Illusionism / GM Force, etc., but I'm thinking she might enjoy games that are a little gentler in some respects.<br/><br/>I also have a player on the autism spectrum among my four teenage Blades in the Dark players. (I run BitD two hours a week at this weird hippy unschooling place. It's totally awesome.) He has two main issues that prevent him from truly gelling with the rest of the group, though despite them he has had some really good moments. The first is that he also freezes and has trouble being creative in moments of high pressure for the characters. The second is that he often has trouble being concrete when it's his turn to speak. He'll say what he's thinking about, what his general idea is, etc., but he often doesn't give me enough to actually know what Action to have him roll. Everyone else in the group is really patient and tries to help him out when he's jammed, but it's a real problem, and my usual GMing techniques are <i>not</i> helping.                        </div>

                            Continuing on...<br/><br/>4.  One of the "rules" of the world is not everything is at it seems.  If something is too good to be true, it probably is.  So we had this one new player who game after game went after every (to me obvious) bauble that the DM dangled before him.  In one particular instance the player was playing a new barbarian (as most of his characters tended not to survive more than a session or two) when he saw a barbarian lord with his hoard wielding a magic sword.  Mind you magic is exceedingly rare in our game.  I've been playing for 20 years and in all that time I've had one magical sword and it wasn't super powerful.  This isn't to say magic swords can't be powerful, they're just extremely rare.  So the DM describes this barbarian lord and suggests to this play that if he could defeat him the player would have his this sword.  Sounds plausible but consider the following.  The barbarian was described a lord.  He had a horde.  If the barbarian lord was low level then the other barbarians would have killed him for the magic sword.<br/><br/>The player's barbarian is 1st level.  How is he going to fight his way through the horde to get to the barbarian lord (certainly higher level than the PC and likely higher level than most of his horde then engage in single combat with a substantially higher level NPC who happens to also possess a magic sword.  For a barbarian looking to make a name for himself...maybe go for the gusto.  He did and the sword ate his soul.  However the player kept making the same style of mistake every....single....game.<br/><br/>5.  One of the "themes of world" is the struggle of good against evil.  So a player who consistently turns their character evil causes serious problems with the rest of the players at the table.  I mean it's one of the various reasons why we play - to fight the good fight.  We had this one player who, well, let's say always chose the left hand path.  It got to the point where we had a saying about him.  "The sun will always rise.  Gravity will always work. *Player name* will always go evil".  It really caused a lot of disharmony, bruised feelings and acrimonious moments in and out of game - especially on the Social Contract level.  The game ceased to be fun to play or the enjoyment level was severely compromised.<br/><br/>6.  I'm not really sure what to put in here.  It's just like in a book or movie where the protagonist misreads a situation or clues that when rectified leads to sharp plot twist opening up new vistas and possibilities where all was dark or narrows the possibilities as we work to close in on our goal/target.  The best I can think of happened before I started to play and that was the table was convinced that Aragorn was dead.  I'll have to ask how that came about but the players knew he was in a certain area, that a major skirmish had happened and that a newly dug grave had been found.  I believe, but am not certain, that Aragorn's broken sword was plunged into the ground like a grave marker.  I know there were other clues scattered around but I can't remember any at the moment.  For whatever reason the grave was left undisturbed and the whole table labored under the assumption that Aragorn was indeed dead.  About 10 years later in real time he showed up again and the explanation for the evidence was entirely plausible.  Whatever had happened it was Aragorn who had survived and buried his companion and then took off after whatever he needed to do.  I'm doing a terrible disservice with this story and I apologize but I remember being told about it and being enrapt by how it all unfolded.<br/><br/>Hope that helps.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

We do.<br/><br/>Music is a HUGE aspect in our play.  Our DM has somewhere around 500-1000 motion picture soundtrack CDs.  He doesn't lug them all around and only a smallish percentage have migrated over to digital but they are so important to our play that its lack knocks at least half or more out of the enjoyment of the session.  He uses motion picture soundtracks over classical or "rock" because for the most part soundtracks are designed to hit a single emotion and hit it hard.  This makes it much easier to use than more complex pieces of music such a "classical" which change emotional tenor throughout the piece.<br/><br/>We don't use "voices" as in "accents" for two primary reasons.  The first is that a good voice is really hard to do and maintain and it usually takes a trained actor to pull it off right.  We aren't trained actors!  The second most "voice" work/accents are cliches and do very little to reveal character (most of the time).  As a screenwriter our DM has come to learn that character is revealed through action and the most interesting reveals are when the choices open the character are all "bad".  So we spend our character efforts on deciding who the character is via our decisions in play.  We've found that most "voice" acting in game (typically accents) usually ends up just being an affectation and almost always an annoying one.<br/><br/>That being said we do play "emotions through voice" when we can and where appropriate.  If we are trying to convince the town populace to stay and fight or to flee right now(!) we try to play the urgency both in our word choice and how we say them.  We try to project stern, majesty, fear, reverence, leadership, etc., to aid our efforts in working with NPC's which is a large part of the game.<br/><br/>One of our players is a business owner and is relatively well off so has purchased a fair number of decent looking foam weapons to help us "sell" our combat actions to the DM.  I must say holding a sword in your hand does help get us into the proper mindset for combat.  I find that we think and act differently when we are swinging these mock weapons.  I doubt that we are actually using them "properly" but it does help us think of actions when the camera is on us during combat.<br/><br/>We also use our bodies in a number of ways from portrayings actions to helping convey a mood/emotion quite a bit.  Earlier this year I was playing a character who was an only child who was "commanded" to bring his mother to a town to aid in the healing of a mortally wounded leader.  This person who "commanded" this of me foretold me a number of events and things I should say or do which came to pass.  What he didn't tell me was that should would die in the town when it was attacked by an immensely powerful cadre of Black Numenoreans.  I went out to lay my mother to rest and came back to the wrecked town.  I caught word that a man had gone out to "hunt" the attacks so I followed after to try an exact some measure of vengeance before I died in the process.  I was no way leveled high enough to take on such a group but I (the player) was in fey mood.  Eventually I caught up to the man hunting and it turned out to be the very man who "commanded" me to bring my mother to the town where she not only died but her body had been badly defiled.  I raged at the DM.  I accused this man of murder and of being a thief.  I screamed my voice hoarse.  I promise you my stance was extremely aggressive.  Reals tears were flowing as I vented my anguish while my voice trembled in rage.  I know I slammed my hand on the table several times.  In the end I decided that this "murderer" was not worth me killing him.  He demanded that I pass sentence on him at least twice - so I told him if he wished a sentence then let it be thus - that he should bear the pain of my loss everyday for the rest of his life.  And I walked away.  Though my character did not know it, this man was Aragon.  Though the chance of me actually killing him was slim the DM was willing to let the event play out however the pieces fell - even if it meant I had killed Aragorn.  (My character was a peredhel or half-elf and my physical attributes were off the charts.  This was (and is) a truly once in a lifetime character. (In all the world, there are only 3 peredhel, Elrond, myself and another PC who is the 2nd highest leveled character in the game)  He was about 8th level at the time.  If I had gotten a few good rolls and had the DM rolled poorly the world would have been bereft of its future king and a principle player in the war of the rings.)  I digress but let me say I that when I raged at the DM I was physicalizing all of it and not of it was for effect - it was me raging and everything that entails physically short of actually making contact with the DM.  Enough of that digression...<br/><br/>As mentioned above pacing is a vital part of package of techniques to intensify real emotions during play.<br/><br/> </div>

                            The DM uses "editing" cutting in and out of a players action for dramatic impact.  This is frequently done with action music playing.  Again I will say that the music is immensely effective for pushing a real emotional mood upon the players.  Last of the Mohicans - "Elk Hunt" is a perennial when rushing or trying to save a person/town/etc., before "<i>It's Too Late</i>."  This is so effective that when we are BSing around talking about the game (out of game) and this track comes on that it causes goose bumps to appear!  Very Pavlovian but then that's the point - just hearing it gets our autonomic nervous systems all jangling.  He might use "Molossus" from "Batman Begins" for a different flavor of combat circumstances - usually man vs man as opposed to man vs monster.  Sometimes when a Dunedain is out in the night sitting at a fire by himself reflecting on his life the DM might play "Dante's Prayer" by Loreena McKennitt.  Heading into an Elven realm might occasion "Dreams to Dream" from "An American Tail" or "Storms in Africa" by Enya.  When dealing with something very powerful and very evil we get "Vampire Hunters" from "Bram Stoker's Dracula".  When the evil is not centered on a single creature but more from an area he might use "Dracula - The Beginning" from said the same soundtrack.  (Also "To Think of a Story" from "Frankenstein" also fits in this category)  Let me tell you that just hearing either of the these three tracks puts an immediate palpable dread over the table.  Just because I've been thinking about music and all the visceral memories I'll add that the DM used "Conquest of Paradise" from "1492" for a scenario that looking back we called the Dwarven Day of the Dead which was a whole game centered on the Dwarves remembering their fallen.  I don't remember how he did it, but it held our rapt attention for hours.  Another he used was actually a track from a computer game called "Dark Reign: Future of War - track 1" for a group we called Black Commandos who were unbelievably lethal and nearly decapitated the leadership of Gondor. <br/><br/><b>Music works</b>.<br/><br/>We haven't used source sounds as they are too difficult to use properly.  It takes a lot to create effective/rich ambient sound.  Though the topic has come up on occasion mostly on the part of the DM.  The players usually argue against it because unless the sounds are really layered it just sounds pale and repetitive.  Nor have we played with lighting, but this topic too has been broached a few times.<br/><br/>There you go.  I hope it the above was helpful to someone.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Thinking further, I have a question about "bricolage" and "Semiotic Jazz". As I understand it, it's a process of piecing together fictional elements collaboratively and improvisationally, with the goal of creating a coherent and pleasing fictional whole or resulting fiction.<br/><br/>That's a powerful concept, and could be a useful metaphor.<br/><br/>However, what I'm not sure about is... isn't that how most roleplaying endeavours work already? <br/><br/>I can imagine some exceptions - perhaps a GM running a module "by-the-book" and refusing to do any interpretation might not be considered to be engaging in the "Semiotic Jazz", for instance.<br/><br/>But, otherwise, is this not the basic process of most RPG play? If not, then how is it not?<br/><br/>(Or is this kind of like Ron Edwards' concept of "exploration squared", where, sure, this happens in all games, but in these games, well, it's <i>the central element and the point of play</i>?)<br/><br/>I wonder if there's element of this idea I'm missing. Help me out?                        </div>

Referencing back to the new player who the DM legitimately became concerned over his health (worrying that the new player might stroke out people his face flushed so purple and veins were popping out on his head!) said scenario was set on an island that was overrun with ghouls.  The ghouls could not abide daylight so the party went to work building a small palisade to ride out the night.  The new player got separated from the party and by the time he realized nightfall was imminent it was too late to let him into the palisade.  There was no gate to open nor rope to lower down and there was not enough time to remove a few timber and replace them as the ghouls were already on the move.  The new player begged entrance but nobody would let him in because it would have been certain death for everyone.  As the DM described the sounds of the ghouls coming and the sun light dimming . . . the description kept coming on . . . he did have options but couldn't think due to pressure of the running clock.</p></div></blockquote>That actually sounds really cool to me.  Well, I guess it depends on how he got separated from the party, but assuming that part was consensual, then being put in the position to either seek safety alone or die bravely sounds pretty perfect for this game, and the running clock sounds like a great way to make it impactful.<br/><br/>I can see how the player got jammed, though.  I think, in addition to time pressure, there might also be an authoring/immersing quandary here.  If I'm <i>riffing off Tolkein</i>, dying an epic death can be cool.  If I'm <i>living in my character's shoes</i>, on the other hand, well, no one wants to die, and some degree of panic is a natural reaction to a situation that looks like death.  <br/><br/>My ideal solution for this sort of thing is to just make sure everyone plays a character who, in their actual nature within the fiction, constitutes a solid riff of Tolkein, so that the player can "just play the character" and it covers both bases.  I imagine you guys do something similar, and that, for new players, learning to define their character the right way in their own heads -- as a real person, but also as a Tokleinesque figure -- is part of the learning curve.  Is that right?<br/><br/>This guy hadn't completed that learning curve, so it was just a straight-up "I'm about to die" without that extra context that would have made it exciting, like "I'm about to die, and I will die nobly, and in so doing inspire my kingdom to join the fight against Mordor" or perhaps "I seem about to die, but my people are hardy and resourceful beyond normal folk, and I will find a way to endure" or something.  Right?<br/><br/>As for the pacing stuff, I think that's super important and super interesting, so I'll start a new thread on that at some point.  Plenty more still to respond to in this one!                        </div>

I have one friend with ADHD who often does not react well to these situations, and she can be tough to challenge and is left feeling frustrated often. She definitely wants games with real meaningful choices and consequences, hates Illusionism / GM Force, etc., but I'm thinking she might enjoy games that are a little gentler in some respects.<br/><br/>I also have a player on the autism spectrum among my four teenage Blades in the Dark players. (I run BitD two hours a week at this weird hippy unschooling place. It's totally awesome.) He has two main issues that prevent him from truly gelling with the rest of the group, though despite them he has had some really good moments. The first is that he also freezes and has trouble being creative in moments of high pressure for the characters. The second is that he often has trouble being concrete when it's his turn to speak. He'll say what he's thinking about, what his general idea is, etc., but he often doesn't give me enough to actually know what Action to have him roll. Everyone else in the group is really patient and tries to help him out when he's jammed, but it's a real problem, and my usual GMing techniques are <i>not</i> helping.</p></div></blockquote>
I've been thinking on your post for the last few days and at first I thought that you're female play might enjoy some Narrativist facilitating given your description about meaningful choices and consequences.  Not to say that all the CA's can't provide such moments but Narrativism does provide those types of choices typically without the time pressures and can be done collaboratively.<br/><br/>Regarding your other player all I can offer is that you talk to a professional regarding the ins and outs of autism and see if there are ways to help you help your player communicate more effectively.  Other than that you may have to consider that said player's communication issues might be organic and may not be changeable in which case you might seeks ways to better help him with his frustration.  It sounds like you have an awesome group on that front and you are truly blessed.<br/><br/>Wish I had something to more concrete to offer.  Have as much fun as you can and recognize that all players are suited for pressure cooker games.  My most recent posts hopefully illustrated that point.<br/><br/>Keep up the good work!<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

To the best of my knowledge it was a game played at a gaming store and he was a first time player to the table.  Afterward the DM spoke with said player and asked what he thought to which he replied (paraphrasing), "That was the best game experience I've ever played.  I'll never do that again.  I play to relax."  With that, he fumbled out a cigarette with hands that were literally shaking and lit up.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

Close but no cigar.  The problem lies with the assumptions found in a word or two and expressed goals.  Let's see if I can unpack this in a useful manner.<br/><br/>Latent within this description is the very subtle conflation of Creative Agenda with Exploration.  This is partly due to the misunderstanding of what "improvisation" means within the "Semiotic Jazz" formulation.  Again, we run into the problem with the idea that "improvisation" means creation without any constraints.  Hence my very, very specific use of the word Jazz.  As you have so kindly taken the time to explain to me, to actually get to the point of playing the solos in improvisational jazz lots and lots of work sussing out the Standard and the Chord Progressions needs to be completed.  This requires even earlier work learning Music Theory (either explicitly or implicitly) and the mastering of the soloist's chosen instrument which will affect said player's tonal choices while riffing.<br/><br/>Once all the above is accomplished then comes the hard part - the actual improvisation of the Standard on the fly while keeping an ear open to what the other soloists are creating.<br/><br/>This is most certainly not some person picking up an instrument for the first time and making noises with it.  Though that "could" be called an improvisational act it is most definitely not Improvisational Jazz.  There are lots and lots and lots of "implicit" rules as to what informs aesthetically pleasing Improvisational Jazz and what is random notes (essentially random noise).<br/><br/>All the above is, by analogy to role-play, Creative Agenda. Creative Agenda, by analogy, tells us what we're doing with the instruments.  The following is going to terrible because its argumentation by analogy but here goes...<br/><br/>Let's start by working with the idea of Exploration.  In role-play it has been described by Setting meeting Character leading to Situation which is working out using System with a splash of Color. The five elements of Exploration.  The definition of Exploration says absolutely nothing about what we do with it - which helps explain why so many published games are incoherent.<br/><br/>To give an example of this I'll abstract further.  Imagine a bicycle.  We'll call it "Exploration" for this exercise.  What we do with that bike is Creative Agenda.  One person might ride it.  Another might hang it on the wall to be admired as a piece of art. A third person my use it as a tool for building something.  The point is that Exploration is a <i>description</i> of the pieces that make role-play, role-play and not a chess set or a basketball court.<br/><br/>Going back to my early analogy of "Semiotic Jazz" lets say that Exploration is the instruments.  A Gamist form of play might be competition among the various players to play a piece of music the fastest or perhaps a complex piece with the minimum of errors, etc.  Yes they are employing the instruments the point isn't to "make" music but rather to use the instruments and any "rules" to define the bounds of the Challenge to Step on Up.<br/><br/>Narrativist style of musical play might be thought of a process whereby a proposed musical premise-theme is considered and chosen by the players present and they set out to "write" a composition through play using the proposed musical theme or premise-theme to write a complete composition.  They stop their playing of instruments to converse about where they want the composition to go and then start playing again.<br/><br/>Simulation as I'm proposing it would be, by analogy, Improvisational Jazz.  We start with the Standard, the Chord Progressions, Music Theory and Instrumental skills to riff on the pre-existing standard to come up with an aesthetically sounding extension of the Standard. The key here isn't that we're creating a finished product like a composition.  No.  Sim lives in the moment.  The exciting part of Sim playing that Jazz right here, right now!<br/><br/>All three forms result in music being played but the why and how of the process are completely different.  Most importantly all these whys and hows are not, by way of analogy, are Creative Agenda is action and not Exploration.<br/><br/>At the risk of sounding redundant Exploration is the parts, Creative Agenda is the how and why we use the parts.  In all cases if nothing new is created (winning tactics, a completed story with a beginning, middle and an end with a compelling theme or riffing on an existing Standard) if the players are not given freedom to create as informed by their choice of CA then they are not expressing a CA.<br/><br/>Such play exists but its typically referred to as "railroading" if the GM is preventing the players from being creative.  No real term for describing a play style where the players of their own free will choose not to have creative input has been really been discussed but two that I've heard are the common "beer and pretzel game" and another so called "Zilchplay".<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                          </div>

<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I think "your character can only make decisions as fast as you can" has important performance <i>and</i> structural implications.</p></div></blockquote>
I'm no designer but I'll offer some thoughts about the implications of such quick decision making in play.<br/><br/>The first is that when events get hot, usually combat but not always, I find that I spend the time that the camera is off me thinking hard about what I'm going to do next.  These limited brain cycles also have to share space with keeping abreast of the developments during said combat.  Sometimes out of a gaming session we might work on combat moves to use in game.  Same thing in upcoming politically important meetings - I'll spend time think about what I'm going to say either when the camera is off me or even out of game entirely.  It might seem or feel that thinking out of game is a form a cheating the "right now" sense of the game but is it really any different than thinking on or working out some new ideas regarding the Standard and some possible riffs that one might try experimenting with during their solo, if the circumstances fit.<br/><br/>Like I mentioned earlier sometimes we'll forego die rolling altogether either because of the speed of events or doing so will break the intensity of some emotionally powerful moment, i.e., my "encounter with Aragorn".<br/><br/>On the mechanical side the we play has really trimmed down handling times.  Almost everything is handled by one die, the D20.  We do have some provisions for a crunchier combat experience if it helps fuel the feeling of danger.  So sometimes if we hit the DM will call for a percentile roll which indicates where we've struck which is followed by the damage dice which are mostly a single die roll and occasionally 2 dice.  The damage dice are exploding and typically this is allot of fun as we're fighting for our lives usually resulting in cheering from around the table.<br/><br/>I just realized one thing that I've never mentioned about our combats before.  I've mentioned that frequently we're outnumbered but the actual fighting is typically single combat.  IOW it's up to you the player and only you to survive and win the specific battle before moving on.  This is also huge stressor for you get into trouble chances are someone cannot come to help as they are tied up in single combat.  In a given combat if it is lengthy sometimes the GM will cut away to another combat to keep the other players involved and keep the person who is mid combat on tenterhooks of suspense.  Maybe help might be coming if another player can finish their combat in the time the camera is on them.  Who knows?<br/><br/>We also have called shots with large and very large penalties but can put an end to a very powerful foe quickly - if your character has the skills and some good luck.<br/><br/>A natural "20" during combat is usually followed by another "D20" roll to see if the hit is a "critical hit".  If so then fairly radical changes in the combat typically transpire.<br/><br/>Natural 20's are always exciting and brimming with possibilities.<br/><br/>Again - the "point" of the added crunchiness is to add more excitement and drama to the unfolding action, not to granularize the combat and make deterministic rulings.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                         </div>

                            Paul,<br/><br/>I think we may have been using "bricolage", at least some of the time, to describe something that happens on the technique level, whereas we've been using "semiotic jazz" more to describe the group's creative agenda (including, perhaps, the bundle of supporting techniques).<br/><br/>It seems plausible to me that all roleplay engages in <i>some</i> bricolage, but it's Semiotic Jazz play which prioritizes it.<br/><br/>So, like, when I form my plan to storm the castle in an old-school challenge game, there's probably some bricolage involved in the way I deliver that speech in-character, or in any callbacks I may make to previous castle-stormings, or in how I try to describe the fiction in entertaining ways as per our shared "standard" of enjoyable group missions.  Or maybe there isn't any bricolage.  It's kinda hard to tell, with the dial turned down that low -- the <i>point</i> is getting into the castle without dying.<br/><br/>Contrast that to what Jay's describing, where if there's any castle-storming going on, I'd assume that the point is how we use castle-storming to add cool moments or facets to the tapestry of "these heroes adventuring in Middle Earth".<br/><br/>My castle-storming is cool because we built a plan that represents our best effort to succeed.  The bricolaged color is a bonus.<br/><br/>Jay's castle-storming is cool because it resonates.  And the bricolaged color is what makes it resonate.<br/><br/>Jay,<br/><br/>Does that sounds right to you?                        </div>

                            Hi Paul,<br/><br/>I apologize for being such a knucklehead and misreading/misunderstanding your question so badly.  On the whole David has the right of it.<br/><br/>As per Chris L's essay most bricolage that does take place in RPG's takes place in what is, in some corners of the hobby, frequently derided as rules "hacking".  Bricolage is a tool or method that is used at times to spackle over momentary blips when the mechanics system fails (for whatever reason) and no one wants to stop play to reengineer the entire system.  Having solved the problem, at least for the time being, the game can proceed and continue to use deterministic abstracted mechanics to either resolve (Task Resolution in the service of a level playing field so Step On Up may be objectively measured) or drive play (Conflict Resolution by giving the players means to Address Premise through abstracted means of actually articulating the Premise Question, scene framing, setting fallout, etc.).<br/><br/>In Sim bricolage is the beating heart behind the non-deterministic mechanics which are informed and constrained by the aesthetics in what I've been describing as being expressed by "Semiotic Jazz".  Whereas Sim is smothered by deterministic (objective) mechanics G/N are best supported by such deterministic (objective) mechanics.  In Gamism, without deterministic objective mechanics I suspect such play would quickly degenerate into some form of "Calvin-Balling".  In Narrativism, without deterministic objective mechanics, I believe the apportioning of narration rights and the setting of stakes would become a real issue.  Because Sim operates prioritizing the "Science of the Concrete" it is and must needs be an intensely subjective process, the very antithesis of the objective, granular processes of G/N.<br/><br/>As per Chris' article bricolage is both <i>the process and the product</i>.  Well, actually he said that specifically about mythic/ritual thinking but we are using the process of bricolage as an <i>analogy</i>.  The key is that bricolage as analogy (to help illuminate a Semiotic process) does not inherently contain a guiding aesthetic.  Hence the use of the Jazz analogy.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a>
<blockquote>Contrast that to what Jay's describing, where if there's any castle-storming going on, I'd assume that the point is how we use castle-storming to add cool moments or facets to the tapestry of "these heroes adventuring in Middle Earth".</blockquote>
I don't know if I'm being nitpicky or making an important point so I'll leave that to you to decide.  <br/><br/>"...where if there's any castle-storming going on it's because as 'sentient individuals struggling to survive in Middle Earth' we are castle-storming because as said characters we feel that we have no other choice but to risk our lives and do so.  The how's and why's were informed by both the themes we love about Middle Earth and everything that's transpired in play up to the moment we step foot on the bottom rung of the scaling ladders."<br/><br/>That we've added to the tapestry of Middle Earth is a secondary consideration to the how, why and of what we're doing <i>Right Now!</i>.  Doing <i>this</i>, Right Now, in an aesthetically pleasing way is <i>very cool</i>.  That Jazz solo, all by your lonesome and in front of everyone with no room for mistakes or "do overs" while being both creative and pleasing <i>makes</i> the whole process exhilarating!<br/><br/>I'm curious if this makes any sense to you.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Jay,<br/><br/>I don't think your note about bricolage "hacking" over mechanical blips in deterministic systems is the best illustration for the current discussion about semiotic jazz play.<br/><br/>If I understand it right, bricolage in sem-jazzy play is more about completing the cognitive loop, whether or not any "blip" is ever experienced.  Like, we're playing the game, we're all talking, and maybe someone narrates something about the fiction that I hadn't expected, and I add something, either in my brain or out loud, to bring it all together into a cohesive whole.
<blockquote>GM: (speaking as elf prince) "Our lands have lived in constant watch since the scorching tracks were found.  Should it truly be a Balrog, our very existence is threatened."<br/><br/>Me: (thinking as visiting ranger) Oh shit, everyone here is on edge?  I'd been imagining a very confident bearing.  Well, maybe elves in their own lands always intimidate me a bit, and now I'm realizing that those martial poses of heightened alert weren't for me.  "Now that you've mentioned it, my lord, I do detect an extra weight of care upon your warriors."</blockquote>
Right?<br/><br/>And I think <i>that</i> is the part that Paul was noting is present in all roleplaying.<br/><br/>As to how that's <i>different</i> in semiotic jazz, I'm not sure how best to talk about that.  I think we're getting there, but I find it challenging.  My take:<br/><br/>1) I know the bricolage does more of the work all by itself with fewer alternatives, supporting structures, or safety nets.  So that's important.  <br/><br/>2) And I know that the resulting experience -- NPC delivers exciting news, PC replies in satisfyingly appropriate fashion (e.g.) -- is the primary matter of group interest (as opposed to winning or whatnot).  And <i>that</i> is <i>very</i> important.<br/><br/>3) But I think the criteria for what makes something "exciting" or "satisfyingly appropriate" is hard to describe.  I took a stab with my "heroes adventuring in Middle Earth" thing, but that wasn't quite right.

                            Hi David,<br/><br/>You've presented some interesting questions and I'll do what I can to clarify.  Be patient with me please as work through some fundamental ideas and work towards the larger issues.<br/><br/>Bricolage - As we all know, by now, is a physical 3D art form <i>and</i> process.  So its use an analogy while useful will eventually break down.  So what makes this art form a useful as an analogy for ritual/mythic thought and by extension Sim play?  Four reasons that I'm aware of.  <br/><br/>One is the "shed of pre-existing parts" that we have as our source material.  Parts are not engineered to one specific thing very well.  Rather we use what existing parts are already available in the with all their imperfections and problems.  It is understood that the employment of a certain part to fix one (or more) problems will create one (or more) future problems.  And thus it is with the mythic/ritual problem solving process (and by extension Sim play). <br/><br/>Which brings us to the second part of using Bricolage as a useful analogy. Bricolage, by analogy, is a <i>type of problem solving technique</i>.  It's terrible by Western abstract thinking engineer types because the way it works always brings in new problems.  Yet it's an awful lot of fun to use as a problem solving technique partly because it never ends.<br/><br/>Third Bricolage works an analogy because it mirrors the mythic/ritual problem solving process in that once a part it added to the whole it cannot be removed again.  To western abstract thinking instead of using the iron or toaster that are in the tool shed because we need something to create heat the engineer will specifically design a very efficient heating element that solves the problem very well, but doesn't contain much potential for much else.  The Bricoleur will use the iron for its ability to heat but understands that it comes with such problems as heavy weight and bulkiness <i>which will have to be addressed</i>.<br/><br/>Finally Bricolage as an art form and analogy does not work toward an engineered design goal but rather functions as as a <i>design in the moment</i> effort.  It's not the created whole that is the primary effort but the actual process of making the decisions of what items to pull from the shed Right Now.<br/><br/>So in sum Bricolage as an analogy for mythic/ritual thought is a <i>problem solving process</i> that works with the "concrete parts" in the shed of available items (the source material and everything that has happened in play) as opposed to abstracting and designing in the Western way.<br/><br/>This is important.  Bricolage as analogy is a problem solving process. <br/><br/>In game terms it's a Technique.  It functions within the fiction of the SIS.  This Technique stays within the game play process and does not abstract upwards.  <br/><br/>Hence referring to the rules hacking <b>in game</b> is a perfect example of Bricolage in play.  If you haven't read <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=14371" rel="nofollow">Chris Lehrich's essay on Bricolage</a> <i>I beg you</i>, please do so now.  He explains the whole idea a thousand times better than I can ever hope.<br/><br/>However, as you noted and for the reasons I've offered above, <i>Bricolage is not a Creative Agenda</i>.  Part of reason it fails is that it neither offers a guiding aesthetic nor does it touch upon a critical issue of relationships.  That is everything in mythic/ritual thinking is based upon the relationship between the object (be it a constellation, an animal, a tree, a tribe) and a human being.  That object is important insofar that a person finds it meaningful and has assigned it a meaning based upon the relationship between the two.  The constellation in the night sky is the avatar of a god of war (Orion).  Objectively is this true?  No.  Subjectively?  Yes.  Why?  Because that person or tribe said so.  How?  Through ritual thinking.  Why?  To answer a problem the tribe might be contending with.  Like - why are we always at war?  Because the god of war (as seen in the constellation) commands it.<br/><br/>I'm proposing that Semiotic Jazz is a Creative Agenda for the reasons that it contains within the Jazz part the source and the aesthetics of why and for what purpose we're using Bricolage.  The Jazz analogy covers the "meaningful parts" of the process.  The jazz soloist must first have a deep and "meaningful relationship" with the Standard.  It has to <i>move</i> him in some "meaningful" fashion.  So we have the relationship between the (source) object and the musician starting to grow.  Then the soloist must deeply consider the Standard when creating his chord progression.  This is again is born both out of the musicians relationship with the Standard (how it affects him) as informed by music theory.  But see even music theory is not an objective science but at its very core a reflection of what we a humans find aesthetically pleasing.  A relationship between tones (and all the various ways they can be employed) and the human listener.<br/><br/>I am told, though, that it is not possible to choose the chords perfectly as there will always be "dissonances".  But that is not a bug/problem but rather an opportunity to the soloist to work out.  So even here on the jazz side of the analogy imperfections ("dissonances") are fodder.<br/><br/>So in referencing the example you so helpfully offered I'm not really seeing any CA in action because I don't see a problem with constraints contained within.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Consider - 
<blockquote>GM: (speaking as elf prince) "For a cycle of Rana, the moon, we have lived in constant watchfulness as a dark dread has settled upon our hearts.  One of the wise has spoken a name out of darkness from Ages past since the scorching tracks were found. Valaruka. Balrog.  Mighty Demon in the tongues of men.  Bane of Elfen folk and lieutenants of Morgoth.  Those of our folk who could face them have long since fallen or taken the Straight Way back to Aman...Perhaps it is time for us to sail the Straight Way as well...and now comes an Engwar.  What would have us in these ill times, Ranger?  Hunter of the foe your folk are but no skills you or your kind have to hunt this terror.<br/><br/>Me: (thinking as visiting ranger) Oh shit, a Balrog?  I've heard some lore long ago about such things but I thought they were just stories.  Now I've got something roaming around that could wipe out entire kingdoms?  I don't know much about them but those here that do are terrified and if I understand them properly mere men cannot stand before them.  How will I deal with that?  And those who may have the ability and lore to face this Balrog are considering fleeing rather than face it.  I know our motto is "One riot, one Ranger" but this is beyond me.  I don't have time to report back to Cair Andros, yet I've got to get their help.  How do I convince them to not only stay in Ea but to come forth in war against this nightmare?<br/><br/>"Fair Prince of the Eldar, first born of Eru.  Know that my captain-commander, Aetdgean, named 'elf-friend' by Glorfindel of the House of Finrod, has always been a friend of your folk.  I too came upon the scorched tracks you spoke of and as a vassal of my commander beg you to extend the title of 'elf-friend' to me that I may ask of you wise counsel in this matter.  Though it has been many uncounted generations of men to you and your folk, I beg you, m'lord, to recall the deeds of the three houses of the Edain who stood and fell in the Leaguer of Belariand, Ages past..."</blockquote>
It's not enough that expectations were merely confounded but rather a whole slew of problems need to be dealt with all at the same time, right now.  Note the complexity of all the "parts" the Ranger has to contend with being a mortal man dealing with immortal elves, that he has a duty as a Ranger to "<i>Do Something</i>" about the Balrog, that as mortals men are utterly ineffective against Maia, said Ranger pulls on his relationship with his commander and the Elves, he has some ancient lore that he pulls on to start to help with the problem of the Elves considering leaving, etc.<br/><br/>Here we have bricolage in action as informed by the jazz process as the player pulls on various bits and pieces available to him and starts to try and assemble them in such a way as to try and sort out this impossible problem.<br/><br/>I apologize for the length but the problem with mythic/ritual thinking is that to make sense of anything requires fairly extensive knowledge of the myth itself.  Thus to show an example of Semiotic Jazz in action requires lots and lots of context.
<blockquote>I definitely think that's better that what I said. But it's not one simple, concrete idea, and thus it's harder to refer to as an explanation. I think teasing a principle or two out of that would be useful, if possible...</blockquote>
Which is why my explanations are so wordy as you so rightly noted above.  You're right, it's not concise but I just don't have the tools to simplify what is such a difficult topic.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Jay,<br/><br/>Good stuff! I particularly love that example.<br/><br/>Some more thoughts and questions:<br/><br/>* I can get on board with the premise that <i>bricolage</i> is a Technique for creating play in an RPG, and that Semiotic Jazz is a sort of larger concept, including why we want to do it, why we love it, and what we get out of it, as well as the "how".<br/><br/>* Since you've been asking me about jazz stuff: yes, it's possible to play a "perfect" solo or a "perfect" performance. However, that can also become boring, predictable, or stifling. I think there are plenty of parallels here to stories, roleplaying, themes, and so forth.<br/><br/>Do we always choose the safe, familiar, and "correct"? Or do we wish to have more room for error, in hopes of finding *new* things by creating something unfamiliar? It's an important decision made by any artist, sometimes in consistent trends, and sometimes in the moment, only to (perhaps) regret it and go back to the other side.<br/><br/>* What I see from that example of "bricolage", is, perhaps, in Forge theory terms, something like "Colourful Exploration". Is that fairly accurate? If not, what distinguishes the two?<br/><br/> </div>

Meaningful in a very specific way.<br/><br/>The "pulling on available bits and pieces" you allude to includes weaving tighter the web of connections which informs everyone at the table's sense of investment.  Some random Balrog wandering a random path through some random woods populated by random pointy-eared people means nothing to anyone, and a big part of your group's shared creative endeavor (and agenda) is to elevate those factoids into <i>integral</i> parts to a celebration-worthy whole.<br/><br/>We <i>care</i> about <i>this</i> Balrog in <i>these</i> woods because of all that context you mentioned -- elf-human interactions, ancient history, recent history, the ranger's personal and hierarchical relationships, the might of mythic beings, etc.<br/><br/>A skilled semiotic jazz player doesn't just figure out how his character should tackle a problem.  A skilled semiotic jazz player also gets the table to <i>care</i> as much as possible about the moment.  They do this by tying the moment to established matters of shared interest.<br/><br/>So, <i>basic</i> bricolage is finding some way to connect some dots so play can keep moving forward.  <i>Good</i> bricolage is connecting the dots in a way that maximizes connection to what the group cares about and/or is celebrating.<br/><br/>(And if we want to try to draw any parallels between types of creative agendas, we could say that this challenge/goal of semiotic jazz -- to maximize resonance -- is akin to the core challenges/goals of winning and creating theme in gamism and narrativism, respectively.)<br/><br/>Jay, is that right?

Or this could be specific to Tolkein, a fiction presented as history which is <i>all about</i> today's actions reflecting and resonating with past epics and with the greater world in which they occur.  <small>(But maybe this is also true of Star Wars... and Marvel comics... which are also popular among gamers in this play style...)</small><br/><br/>P.P.S.  And I might be borrowing too much from the "right" part in Ron Edwards' "right to dream" idea.  But if so, then wow, "right to dream" is a terrible way to phrase it.  "Dare to expand" or something would be better.  <small>(And the Forge's one-time focus on challenging <i>whether</i> the source material can handle the group's expansions, and then being happy when it <i>can</i>, is really just an example, not <i>the</i> agenda.  "We did our own very cool, very LotR stuff" makes much more sense to me as a way to celebrate LotR, as opposed to "we tried some out-there LotR stuff and LotR didn't break!"  But maybe the Forge folks were talking about something else.  "Sim" is not "Sim" etc.)</small> </div>

<blockquote>* Since you've been asking me about jazz stuff: yes, it's possible to play a "perfect" solo or a "perfect" performance. However, that can also become boring, predictable, or stifling. I think there are plenty of parallels here to stories, roleplaying, themes, and so forth.</blockquote>
Fair enough.  I also agree that "perfect" (perhaps "flawless"?) performance, while neat once in a long while, would become boring, predictable and/or stifling.  I'm also with you in thinking there are plenty of parallels to stories, roleplaying, themes, etc.
<blockquote>Do we always choose the safe, familiar, and "correct"? Or do we wish to have more room for error, in hopes of finding *new* things by creating something unfamiliar? It's an important decision made by any artist, sometimes in consistent trends, and sometimes in the moment, only to (perhaps) regret it and go back to the other side.</blockquote>
I would certainly hope that a player is always trying to work something new (and interesting) into the mix.  I would posit that <b>a</b> crucial skill lies in learning how to walk the line between merely repeating that which already exists and playing so far off the reservation as to be completely unrecognizable.
<blockquote>* What I see from that example of "bricolage", is, perhaps, in Forge theory terms, something like "Colourful Exploration". Is that fairly accurate? If not, what distinguishes the two?</blockquote>
I apologize but before I can offer a cogent response I'm going to need a definition of what "Colourful Exploration" means because (again apologies) I haven't a clue.<br/><br/>WRT: Color - In Forge theory parlace "Color" was one of the five elements of Exploration but itself had no effect on the SIS and certainly was not involved in the expression of Creative Agenda.  If it did it wouldn't be color.<br/><br/>I await your definition! <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

<br/>I like Dave's framing of this, two posts up. It all brings me back to Ron's use of the word "celebrate" when talking about Right to Dream play, and how that always spoke to me. This sounds fairly similar.<br/><br/>The term "resonance" is even more compelling: if what we're looking for is to create fiction which resonates with us and the source material, that's a strong metaphor about what makes this kind of thing feel good.<br/><br/>(However, it runs the risk of overlapping with other things we might be talking about or interested in. For instance, can characters and a story really be said to "resonate" with us without challenging and reinforcing a literary theme? I don't know; that gets a little blurry for me. "Celebrate", though, that I like very much!)                        </div>

                            Paul, yeah, good premise-addressing, human issue-tackling play definitely "resonates" too!  I wonder if it's useful to observe that that sort of play resonates with real life in much the same way that Jay's Middle Earth play resonates with fiction?<br/><br/>I mean, real life <i>and</i> fiction are <i>both</i> relevant in <i>both</i> cases, but I feel like the immediate apprehension that something meaningful has occurred in play is triggered differently.  For example, in Sorcerer my play might resonate most, in the eyes of the group, when it evokes and adds to <i>the price of power</i>, whereas in Spicy Middle Earth my play might resonate most when it evokes and adds to <i>Middle Earth's specific struggle between good and evil</i>.<br/><br/>(Not sure if "evokes and adds to" is the right wording there... best I could come up with...)<br/><br/>As for "celebrate", I have two problems with that term:<br/><br/>1) Some play is more obviously celebratory than others, and I think the relationship between the less-obvious kind and the more-obvious kind is complicated.  Do we want to put "Let's emulate the LotR books as faithfully as we can!" in the same basket with Jay's game?  The former holds zero appeal for me while the latter sounds awesome.<br/><br/>2) I think it's important to note the celebratory <i>component</i> of games like Jay's, but I'm really leery of labeling "celebration" as <i>the point</i>...  I feel that <i>the point</i> is more about the thing you're making that's your own, and that celebrating Tolkein is just one (very important!) feature of that thing.  It's less "Yay, Middle Earth is so fun to play with!" and more "Yay, the specific thing we do with Middle Earth is so fun!"  That's how I see the appeal, anyway.  It's part celebration/homage, but also part... riffing on the standard.  Emphasis on the riffing.  <br/><br/>I don't care about hearing Take The A Train.  I care about hearing <i>Duke Ellington's version, tonight,</i> of Take The A Train.  I mean, I do like the song, but I'm really there for Duke.                        </div>

                            Imagine you and your four friends get together to create bricolage art. You all agree that the piece you'll create will have a theme--let's say it's Joy. You all show up with a bunch of stuff from your garage, knick-knacks from the local dollar store, whatever you can round up fast and cheap. <br/><br/>At first, you aren't all exactly on the same page as you glue this and that together. Is it Joy? Not really. At least, not what you'd all collectively think of as Joy. But over time, you get better at reading each other. Patterns emerge. Shapes. Smiley faces. Maybe you make the eyes and someone else makes the smile, reinforcing each other's shapes. You create a system of rhythm of placing pieces, of symbology, of color choice... you never talk about the system, but it's understood.<br/><br/>You make art together every weekend with new junk. Every week, you get better at doing it together because you've built up a spoken and unspoken vocabulary about what you're creating and because you all share a love for what you're doing, how you're doing it, and what you end up making.                        </div>

                            Hey David,
<blockquote>Jay, whenever you are able to say "semiotic jazz", instead of "Sim", I would prefer that, as it won't invite derailments.</blockquote>
Not a problem - "semiotic jazz" it shall be.  My sincerest apologies if my phrasing facilitated or was causal of derailment of your thread.<br/><br/><br/><br/>WRT - "celebrating" the source material - I agree with you that "celebrating" ... whatever that means ... some source material might (or likely) is the prime <i>motivator</i> for engaging in a behaviour it does not denote nor even connote what we're actually <i>doing</i>.  Even assuming that we're talking roleplaying.  "Celebrating" some source material most certainly does not describe a <i>process of play</i>.<br/><br/>"Celebrating" the source material might be why we play but sheds absolutely no light on how or by what methodology Semiotic/Jazz is actually being accomplished.  To be honest I'm not even sure what "celebrating" means in game terms; it was never defined as a process.  FREX - one could celebrate one's home team winning an important match by rioting in the streets.  One could celebrate a piece of music by purchasing the sheet music and playing it as written.  Onc could celebrate Tolkien by reading his books, or perhaps by reading his books out loud with gathered enthusiasts.  One could celebrate a favorite song by downloading the MP3 and playing it endlessly on a loop.  Perhaps one could celebrate Tolkien by tattooing his face on one's chest.  All are forms of "celebrating" but we illuminate nothing about a "<i>process of celebrating</i>".<br/><br/>Again, I want to make clear that in this case we are using Bricolage as an analogy to help understand the Semiotic process of myth style thinking as applied to RPG's.  In this case bricolage is a very specific methodology for solving problems.  I make this point because by that definition I'm not sure the distinction between "basic" bricolage and "good" bricolage holds, at least as it is currently phrased.  One could be a brilliant bricoleur but still not be a "good" semiotic/jazz player.  Because bricolage is a problem solving methodology one could conceivable employ it and still be addressing challenge/premise.  It would be pretty difficult but it is still theoretically possible.  For example one could be playing in a game as such as the one I play in and still be Stepping On Up with regards to who has the highest level character or who has the most orc kills in an evening.  I freely admit such a game would probably be pretty much weak sauce for the player who is Stepping On Up but it would still be Gamist play.  Just very unsatisfying Gamist play.<br/><br/>Am I correct that by "basic" bricolage you mean uninspired/flat Semiotic Jazz?  Or are you referring to bricolage as a general Technique?<br/><br/>Conversely by "good" bricolage do you mean inspired/creative/group affirming Semiotic Jazz?  Because one could be a good bricoleur and not be engaged in Semiotic Jazz as per my Gamist example above.<br/><br/>If you would be so kind, please let me know how you want me to understand your usage of "basic" and "good" bricolage.  Sorry for the lame "hair splitting" response but I believe the distinctions are vital.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

It's definitely a good start!  I'm still working this through as you are so that's all I have to add for the time being.
<blockquote>P.P.S.  And I might be borrowing too much from the "right" part in Ron Edwards' "right to dream" idea.  But if so, then wow, "right to dream" is a terrible way to phrase it.  "Dare to expand" or something would be better.</blockquote>
I definitely agree.  The whole "right" part drove me absolutely bat sh#t crazy.  It made the whole Agenda sound weak and without power.  "Excuse me...but may I play this way...please...that is, if it's no trouble..."  Ugh!<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

Sorry I didn't clarify; thanks for checking!<br/><br/>I've never discussed bricolage in other sorts of play, and what standards for it might be in those contexts, so that was off my radar.                        </div>

                            This isn't intended as a Forge thing, but as another way of thinking of this stuff.<br/><br/>The "Right" in Right to Dream is about fidelity to the Sim, whatever thing you're Simming on, about getting that thing Simmed "right."  <br/><br/>Really, the "right" part of Right to Dream was meant (by Ron) in two senses of the word:<br/><br/>1. You have a right to play that way. But that's really not important as this:<br/><br/>2. More importantly, it's let's all get this (whatever "this" is for your group) RIGHT. Do it correctly. <br/><br/>Compare to the other Sim formulation of "constructive denial" that focuses on the editing process that players use to bring information into the shared imagined space (fiction). A highly functional group has figured each other out enough that adding the Right stuff to the fiction is easy. A new group has to figure each out and get stuff Wrong a bit, and the editing process kicks in and there's a bit of "no no, not like that" or correction to get it Right, or maybe even just a lack of enthusiasm that the players read properly and course-correct.<br/><br/>That's not so much about celebration and it sheds more light on the process that Sim players use. Yes, celebrating the stuff at the focus of your Sim play, but also editing out (quietly or loudly) the stuff that doesn't fit the group's collective vision. By carving away everything that isn't an elephant, you enjoy the elephant shape that's left over.<br/><br/>The celebration part is really about the reward cycle. You say the Right thing and it furthers the Creative Agenda for everyone at the table. It strengthens the vision of the game. There are also smaller technical rewards for mastery of the Rightness of the material, because if you do the Wrong things, your character may suffer.<br/> </div>

                            I think every discussion of Sim play becomes one of those "understand it in your own way, using your own metaphor" things that happened on the Forge a lot. <br/><br/>Simulationism<br/>Right to Dream<br/>Constructive Denial<br/>Bricolage<br/><br/>Those frames all mean stuff to different people, and the Forge discussions of them all had people going "Aha! Now I get it!" or "This speaks to me more than the other ways..."<br/><br/>For me, all of those approaches to understanding Sim play spoke to me deeply. <br/><br/>To answer your question about what I got out of it:<br/><br/>Sim play is about an editing process. Really, Creative Agenda is about that editing process, but I feel like Sim prioritizes that editing process in a way other CAs don't. I don't see Sim as Exploration-Squared but as Editing-Squared.<br/><br/>Editing is about deciding what goes in and what stays out. Bricolage is just one process for doing that. There are others, and they can be Sim, too. Bricolage leaves a lot up to the table; another type of Sim, which I might call "heavy-predesign simulationism" front-loads the editing (if you play by the rules, or follow the setting material, you'll get the sim you want, but adhering to the RAW is the editing process there). <br/><br/>Constructive Denial is about reinforcing the sim by saying no (sometimes less than directly) when needed to ensure the fidelity of the material you're celebrating. It's editing out the stuff you don't want, only allowing the stuff you want in. <br/><br/>Right to Dream is about getting things "right." That might be setting or character, commonly, but it might also be getting the system right, getting the situation right, getting the color right. The processes you use to make sure it's Right are paramount, as Jay has pointed out.                        </div>

                            Interesting!  Well, if that spoke to you deeply, cool.<br/><br/>When I think of "editing" and "getting stuff right", I think mostly of the training stage, the very beginning of the junk sculpture, before it's Joy or whatever.  It's necessary, but it's not the part I play for.  <br/><br/>I play for the part <i>after</i> that, when we no longer need to worry about "wrong" vs "right" and have moved on to "merely sufficient" vs "totally awesome".<br/><br/>My objective is not to achieve a Joy sculpture, as opposed to failing to achieve a Joy sculpture.  My objective is, okay, given that we <i>have</i> a Joy sculpture, let me do the most uniquely cool stuff with this Joy sculpture that I can!<br/><br/>Compared to that, the details of our process of enacting creative constraint are minutiae in my eyes.<br/><br/>I can't tell whether we're disagreeing about what's fun in play, or about how to talk about it, or just about what parts we like to focus on when we talk about it...                        </div>

                            Just to clarify, Adam, when I asked what you got out of it, I didn't mean "what concepts", I meant "what utility".  Like, how have these concepts helped your play (or design or enjoyment or something)?<br/><br/>I know that's a tough question, though, so feel free to leave it at "spoke to me deeply" and I can infer the usual benefits which come from that.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            I guess in the analogy the Joy sculpture represents (for example) getting the aspects of the setting exactly right. If that's flawed, then the Sim group who are pure-for-setting are not going to enjoy the other stuff so much. <br/><br/>I'd guess that Jay's group is focusing on getting Situation right, actually, where Character and Setting meet. All his descriptions seem to be about Situations. (And a kind of Immersion that is highly dependent on Situation, I think.) But I'm just guessing.                        </div>

                            I don't think we're disagreeing at all, David! You just like different stuff.<br/><br/>So you generally enjoy Sim/RtD play. Note that "totally awesome" is undefined and is basically a restatement of "we have fulfilled our Creative Agenda." What makes play totally awesome for you?                          </div>

                            "Totally awesome" is Jay hunting down the dude who got his mom killed, screaming at him, then deciding that instead of killing the guy, he'd sentence him to forever bear the pain of Jay's character's loss.<br/><br/>To me, that's not LotR <i>done right</i>, it's LotR <i>by Jay</i>.<br/><br/>Aping LotR is easy.  Doing something a little bit new with LotR, in a way that speaks to the history it's now a part of, is a worthy challenge.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>At least, that's the best I can figure.  <br/><br/>I have done almost no canonical setting gaming.  My "wow dude that really resonates with what's come before in play, you rock" moments and patterns have mostly come in years-long homebrews.  But also sometimes in very atmospheric, well-acted one-shots.  When that sort of resonant contribution-and-appreciating has been the primary, secondary, or tertiary reward cycle, I'm not clear on.                        </div>

                            Jay will have to confirm or deny, but I'm not sure that Jay and company feel any compunction to treat the Middle Earth setting as sacrosanct. They probably run roughshod over canon in pursuit of whatever they want out of the game, as it suits their purposes. That's still very much Sim. I never said "LotR done right." To them, "right" is focus on something else (maybe Situation), while being set in a Middle Earth recognizable and useful to them.                        </div>

                            Hi Adam,<br/><br/>As Chris described the bricolage sculpture (and this is where the analogy to semiotics breaks down) it's not that one creates a sculpture that depicts the abstracted idea of joy but rather its about joyfully creating through the sculpting process.  Or if brooding is the "emotion" being worked on then the idea is create the feeling of brooding through the process of creating a sculpture.<br/><br/>But all this is a terrible misapplication of the analogy as employed by Chris (and Claude Levi Strauss) bricolage deals with structures and their inter-relationships.  The analogy treats the "pieces" as vastly complex meaning structures such that to truly understand a given piece is jump down the rabbit hole of further analysis on and on forever.<br/><br/>Let's not get too hung up on the actual 3D art form and treat it instead as vastly simplified analogy for mythic thought.  Bricolage as analogy is not "about" the the sculpture as a completed object but rather as representing a process AND the totality with "problems" that both informs and drives the ever ongoing process.  In myth, as in jazz, there is no end or finality.  A performance or a given telling may end but <i>myth is process</i> just as jazz is about the creation of something new <i>every time</i>.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            No, I don't think skillful is anyone's end goal in Sim. It's the means to an end. You do it so you get the game you want. If you suck at it, you don't get the game you want. <br/><br/>Sim game groups are known to have "tryouts" for new players, to see if they fit. They often form long-running groups of like-minded players playing the same campaign. It's partly because putting together a group who "gets it (right)" is hard to do. It takes skill. It takes knowing each other. It takes building up a shared vocabulary, the semiotics part of semiotic jazz. <br/><br/>"Semiotic jazz" works as shorthand because it conveys a lot of important ideas about difficulty and skill, teamwork and improvisation, meaning and shared language, timing and rhythm, joy and work, structure and surprise.                        </div>

                            Addenda,<br/><br/>I should note that we do not focus on getting Situation "right".  I'm not sure what it is all about, yet, but I can definitely say that it's not about getting Situation "right" - whatever that means.  As roleplay is about dealing with Situation (which is the collision between Character and Setting) in a way that is aesthetically pleasing (which is what CA describes - Addressing Challenge {a type of Situation}, Addressing Premise {a type of Situation}, and Addressing Situation constrained by all the resonating pieces of the Source Material and past play events using a semiotic-bricolage <i>like</i> process that I'm calling Semiotic Jazz) to the group.<br/><br/>It's not about <i>getting</i> it "right" as in <i>doing</i> it well.  There's no particular focus on any particular part of Exploration as more important than there is in G/N.  What informs our play is the Source Material/Standard.  Yes our Setting is Middle Earth, but it's not the physicality of the world (Setting) that is important as is what everything <i>means</i> and what is <i>meaningful</i> to us.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay.                        </div>

                            Maybe this is just a language thing.  To me, "right" denotes mere correctness, and not any sort of awesomeness.<br/><br/>Aside from being a contrast to "right", yeah, I guess "awesome" is a useless label.<br/><br/>What makes Jay's game sound awesome to me is the way the players' contributions resonate with what has come before.  The way the disappearance of Balrogs at the end of the First Age imbues <i>this</i> Balrog with meaning, and the way the ranger's reaction to the Balrog imbues more meaning to the change of the Ages, and so on.                        </div>

I'm going to have to get a better understanding of what you mean by "Setting" in order to answer you in an effective manner.  I will say that we are all struggling a valiantly as we can to keep Middle Earth (Ea) from falling under the sway of Sauron.  We have all done so, at times, by way of sacrificing beloved long held characters to save the life of an important NPC such as Gandalf, Aragorn and Boromir.  We've also sacrificed equally deal characters to try and protect realms like Imladris and Gondor.  We are fighting and losing things (our beloved characters) that are emotionally devastating to us as players to "preserve" Middle Earth".  Conversely when Elladan and Elrohir were killed in a tragic moment of play we were equally devastated.  I mean to the point that it nearly shut down (at that moment) of that night's gaming and I know that I wanted to take time away to grieve.<br/><br/>So I'm not sure what you mean by "run roughshod over Setting".  If you would clarify I would be most appreciative.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            My supervillain game gets a lot of Magneto-ish behavior from the Magneto-ish character, which everyone enjoys, but I think the part everyone enjoys <i>most</i> is when the player does something idiosyncratically "Magneto-with-a-twist".  Like, maybe a godlike display of power with no warning when someone is in the middle of a sentence.  Magneto never really does that because of the way the comics and movies are scripted.  It's funny and unexpected, and as we synthesize this sort of behavior and delivery and storytelling into our own personal troves of supervillainy, we feel those troves expand.  I think that's what play rewards <i>most</i>, and what would <i>most</i> keep people wanting to play again.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call that sudden power burst "getting it right".

                            You just described a bunch of Situations and named some Characters. You named two realms of the Setting, but did not really describe any of the Setting canon. <br/><br/>My suspicion is that you take the canon of Middle Earth as a starting point, then do your own thing inside that setting. <br/><br/>I'm using the Forge definition of Setting: "Elements described about a fictitious game world including period, locations, cultures, historical events, and characters, usually at a large scale relative to the presence of the player-characters." The last phrase about relative scale is important.<br/><br/>How tied up are you in the minutiae of the Middle Earth setting <i>canon</i>, as you'd find in detailed encyclopedias of places and characters and magic and such? If someone gets a little thing about that stuff wrong, is it corrected by others during play?                        </div>

                            I'm with Adam on this. There are lots of different ways to describe this thing, but it all sounds like we're talking about the *same* thing, to me.<br/><br/>Getting something "right" is a little bit weak-sounding, which is why I liked the term "celebrating", and Dave's "expand", as well. It makes sense to me in this context, however. ("Addressing premise" doesn't sound all that exciting on paper either, in other words.)<br/><br/>I suppose all these things are vague enough that we can form whatever mental image we have, based on a catchphrase, and then arguing about our particular visions and how they differ is a little silly.

That's always been my takeaway from the word "right" in that context:<br/><br/>Not that there's an objective measure of correctness, which me strive to score well on, but that we're creating stuff together, and it's when the whole table goes, "Ooh, yeah! That's exactly it!", grinning and smiling (or crying, or whatever), that the social reward cycle kicks in, and everyone is grooving on the content.<br/><br/>For instance, finding out that Saruman was behind the drought in the steppes? "Yes, that resonates with me; it feels <i>right</i>, in my bones."<br/><br/>It's a combination of being surprised (you didn't *know* it was Saruman), which keeps you interested, and it feeling like it's just the right thing; that it fits in the logic and aesthetic of the setting, story, and characters you're all building together.<br/><br/>I like the term 'resonant', too, but, as I said earlier, it's awfully hard to disentangle from Narrativist concerns. Does the Lord of the Rings resonate with us because it's got dramatic heroes and incredible, mythic-quality landscapes and history, or because we appreciate seeing the humble and the righteous triumph over self-destructive evil? In good fiction, those things are never separate.                        </div>

                            As someone who is pretty familiar with Dave's supervillain game (<i>Within My Clutches</i>), I should perhaps share my own observations (this is mostly for Dave's benefit, granted):
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>My supervillain game gets a lot of Magneto-ish behavior from the Magneto-ish character, which everyone enjoys, but I think the part everyone enjoys <i>most</i> is when the player does something idiosyncratically "Magneto-with-a-twist".  Like, maybe a godlike display of power with no warning when someone is in the middle of a sentence.  Magneto never really does that because of the way the comics and movies are scripted.  It's funny and unexpected, and as we synthesize this sort of behavior and delivery and storytelling into our own personal troves of supervillainy, we feel those troves expand.  I think that's what play rewards <i>most</i>, and what would <i>most</i> keep people wanting to play again.<br/></p></div></blockquote>
I think that sounds accurate, and, in my understanding, is a pretty good formulation of RtD/Sim play. That thing you're describing there is exactly what I always took from Ron's talk of "constructive denial" or "potential violation of the package": we're pushing at the limits of this thing we all love (whether we're creating it from scratch or not!), and it feels really good when <i>we can expand it without breaking it</i> or making it feel like it doesn't matter or isn't real anymore.<br/><br/><i>Within My Clutches</i> seems like a very clear Sim-supporting design to me, as well. About as clear as you can get! You can set a scene to "revel in your villainy", for instance, to stage a monologue as your villain. That's, like, the definition of Sim, I think.<br/><br/>It's true that there's a minigame in terms of the dice play in there, and the possibility for some thematic choices when making the final roll, but I think those are fairly minor points in comparison with the main joy of riffing off this thing together.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's a perfect example of the word "right", as well:<br/><br/>At the end of the game, each player gets to finally expose their villain's evil "master plan" to the others, after having hinted about it throughout the game.<br/><br/>I'd say that the most satisfying experiences of playing the game are when you deliver that monologue and the whole tables cheers and nods and smiles: "Yeah, that fits everything we've learned so far, and it *feels right* - it's an excellent villainous plan that's believable and exciting and surprising, but in all the right ways we'd expect from a villain's secret plan. We love it!"<br/><br/><br/><i>In contrast, I'm not even entirely sure that the Spicy Dice game is Sim play! A lot of the emotional resonance sounds very Narrativist-like, and Jay has made references throughout to how you have to effectively "play smart" or you'll die, and how many players can't handle that or make the right decisions or deductions fast enough. But that's a whole kettle of fish I don't expect anyone to settle on the internet! I think we would need a lot more insight into the GM's side of the game to really get a sense of what's going on.</i><br/><br/> </div>

Yes! Creating what is right! It's way less passive than adhering. Adhering might be part of it, but it's a <i>creative agenda</i>. It's all about creating.<br/>

It's exactly it, because you all got it <i>right</i>, which is the end goal (Creative Agenda). But it's not the process. There are a lot of little trained, correct inputs and gentle edits and non-disrupting blocks that get it there. That's the process (Technique layer).                        </div>

                            Yeah, I hear you. I think both must be there for truly great play; I suppose the theory suggests that the former (feeling right) is what must be satisfied first for the group to feel play is fulfilling its purpose, before the latter (does this contribute something new?) is assessed.<br/><br/>However, I don't know if I agree with that, in my experience (I'd have to think about it.) Like "resonance" and premise-addressing, I find "it feels right" and "it contributes something which adds to what's come before" are so heavily overlapping that I'm not sure how to separate them. Contributing something new, significantly adding to and recontextualizing what came before, in other words, are big parts, for me, of what make it "feel right".<br/><br/><br/>EDIT: More importantly, though, I don't think that formulation makes any sense if what you're expecting is for the player's monologue to be all "Hey! That feels right!", any more than the first thought of the player in successful Narrativist play is, "Yes!!! That totally addresses premise!" They are technical terms, here, not descriptive of the full joy of human experience. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            If adding something new and resonant is part of "feels right", then I think we're talking about the same thing.

                            I agree with you. I think the reason "feels right" is interesting for this discussion is not because it describes human joy accurately, but because it's at least an attempt to nail down what's *unique* or *particular* about this style of play (as opposed to other ways to play and enjoy games).<br/><br/>"Resonates" is awesome but too easy to confuse with general sentiments of "hey this game is totally cool, bro".                        </div>

This to me is key.  The only thing that <i>can</i> be LoTR is LoTR.  This very idea was discussed at some great depth in a these two threads entitled <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=13520" rel="nofollow">A wild and an untamed thing - how literature refuses gaming</a> and <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=13560" rel="nofollow">On RPGs and Text [LONG]</a>.  There may have been others but these two were the most salient.<br/><br/>First and foremost is the idea only the text can be the text.  Anything else is quite literally something else.  FREX - the movies of the LoTR is not the book LoTR even if every event and piece of dialogue was unaltered.  One takeaway from the two threads is that using a given work as the source material for a game/campaign does not, cannot be considered self same as the source material.  The transition from the literary work (or movie, etc.) to what happens during play is an entirely different work.  <br/><br/>To quote M. John Harrison who was the reference of the first link -
<blockquote>The moment you concern yourself with the economic geography of pseudo-feudal societies, with the real way to use swords, with the politics of courts, you have diluted the poetic power of Tolkien's images. You have brought them under control. You have tamed, colonised and put your own cultural mark on them.</blockquote>
...and by gum, he's right!  That is exactly what we're doing and that's how role-play functions.<br/><br/>One of the points is that the moment one starts to translate a work from one medium to another (book -&gt; RPG) the work changes.  Chris Lehrich later argues that while it is true that the change from one medium to another does create a wholly new body of work he does argue strongly against the idea that the sense of power and wonder is forever lost.  Power and wonder can be created through the role-play process...its just not the same as in the original work.  And that's a good thing!<br/><br/>The takeaway is that role-play will and must alter the source material.  That's what role-playing <i>does</i>.  It is impossible to not alter the source material and be role-playing...or at least not be expressing a Creative Agenda.  The mere coughing up of pedantic details without putting them to use is more a game closer to a board game along the lines of Trivial Pursuit where <i>nothing</i> is changed WRT the source material than it is to role-playing.<br/><br/>Adam,

You are both right and wrong.  We don't worship at the altar of LoTR as a static stone carved deity that can never change, but <i>change must happen</i> or we're not role-playing.  We constantly bear in mind the canon when playing and making our decisions.  I've met Gandalf and spoken with him in game.  That act, prima facie, breaks canon as no character of mine exists within the canonical works.  The bigger question is will taking <i>this action</i> promote the large long term themes of the book or no.  If the changing of a detail means that the larger scope of events keep moving in the right direction then yes we'll make that choice to alter canon.  But it is most definitely not something that is done in a "roughshod" manner with no thought on its bearing to what we love.  Yet, what we love is what we love - which is not self same as the book.  Even the book is subject to interpretation which varies from reader to reader.  If blind repetition is the goal then it could be argued that one has not even entered the work of the given piece of literature itself.<br/><br/>(Aside - many years ago when Elladan and Elrohir were killed I began to despair that the game had totally left the realm of ME.  In the end I decided that was not the case for many of the reasons cited above.)<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            It seems to me that Paul, Adam, Jay and I have some non-identical but overlapping understandings of what's going on in Jay's play.  Personally, I feel that "right"/"rights" talk is making it much harder to communicate about that.<br/><br/>It seems natural to me that, in roleplay which employs some external source material, the players will riff off that source material in some fashion, and have opinions on each other's riffing.  I think these sorts of responses are possible in <i>any</i> such game:<br/><br/>"Oh, absolutely, that's just perfect, exactly what should happen there."<br/><br/>"Whoa, I never expected that!  That's a bold new direction to take things in."<br/><br/>"Wait, can we please <i>not</i> do that?  That feels totally inappropriate."<br/><br/>The presence of such possibilities doesn't necessarily tell us all that much, I don't think, about the primary drives and rewards of play.  (<i>Of course</i> in <i>any</i> creative endeavor the participants will grant themselves the right/permission to have opinions on what feels right/good/awesome, and to try to do stuff that feels right/good/awesome.)<br/><br/>I think some of Jay's descriptions of Semiotic Jazz get us much closer to a useful understanding of the core of play.  Not only might we care about how Tolkein is honored, celebrated, stretched, repurposed, accidentally violated, etc., but we are <i>also</i> (and <i>more importantly</i>) engaged in a bricolage-like process of collective meaningfulness-building.<br/><br/>Meaningfulness is primarily about what I'm calling resonance -- contributing something new into play which interacts with what's already been played, to make a sum greater than the respective parts.  You might resonate with everyone's knowledge of Tolkein, sure, but the bigger payoffs (if I read Jay correctly) arrive when you resonate with the fabric of everyone's current understanding and past experience of the complete fictional world/history of play.  <br/><br/>Evoking the elves' relationship with your character's commander, for example, connects some dots in a very satisfying way.  If "resonating" is a confusing word, then maybe "linking", "connecting", or "weaving" would be worth a shot.  Sometimes it's a more literal linking -- an explicit call-back to a previous event or NPC -- while other times it's more of a thematic linking, e.g. the way <i>this</i> noble character faces impossible odds for the good of their home, compared to other similar events in prior play.<br/><br/>Successful contribution, as I see it, is like a neural impulse sent through a highly connected region of the brain, dense with rich associations and frequent use.<br/><br/>Unsuccessful contribution, on the other hand, would just flicker out through seldom-used, sparsely connected neurons and fall flat.  Because it isn't resonant, or highly connected, or rich with associations.<br/><br/>I don't think any discussion of "right"/"rights" captures any of that.  I'd prefer to find a better way forward.  Are any of my alternate phrasings here working for anybody?                        </div>

Not to put too fine a point on it, but you're typing gibberish to me.  Please define "Right" and please define what exactly the process of "to Dream" means because neither phrase sheds any light on the subject.<br/><br/>EVERYONE has the right to Step on Up.  EVERYONE has the right to make Story Now.  As a descriptor the "Right" to do anything is empty.<br/><br/>Along the same lines what does it mean to "Dream"?  Does daydreaming about what you plan to do in your next gaming at work session count as "to Dream".  For that matter does having REM Dreams about one's character while one sleeps count as the process "to Dream"?  Or does reading the book (if a book happens to be the source material) and imagining the events in your mind's eye constitute the process of "to Dream"?<br/><br/>The statement "The Right to Dream" while grammatically correct is as an empty a phrase as "The emotional problems of rocks."  Grammatically correct but utterly meaningless.<br/><br/>So please, just this one time, please engage with me and answer the following questions because so far all I've gotten is statements of conclusion but no arguments.
<blockquote>1.  What does "the Right" mean that is in <i>any way</i> different from <i>the Right</i> to engage in <i>any</i> other CA?<br/><br/>2.  <b>Please</b> describe, in reasonable detail, what exactly is involved in the process of the infinitive verb form of "to Dream" with regards to the roleplay process.</blockquote>
Until you answer these questions I cannot even be sure that we are talking about role-playing.  I've made my arguments for Semiotic Jazz and they fulfill all the necessities to be described as Creative Agenda informed process of Exploration.<br/><br/>I eagerly await yours.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

You've described to me a process of jazz (for which I am deeply grateful) that most certainly did not revolve around the nebulous feeling of "this feels right" as the guiding creative process.  My sense was the process was much more rigorous.  I suppose the rare extraordinarily talented individual can blunder through playing improvisational jazz and create something that is interesting to listen to without intimate knowledge of the Standard, a deep understanding of music theory, without taking the effort of developing the chordal progression, picking up any instrument for the first time and going by just what "feels right".  But my sense of the art form is that the chances of such a process based primarily on "that feels right" is extremely unlikely (not impossible) to result in anything remotely close to "music".  Yet the empty methodless description you offer is just the process I have described above.  Utterly unenlightening.<br/><br/>To say that "yeah, this feels right" is the process which leads to great play is to do as much violence to those who play improvisational jazz as to those who play semiotic jazz.<br/><br/>To describe improv jazz in such loving detail and the whole process behind it which requires so much hard earned and learned knowledge of music while then referring to semiotic jazz (with such close parallels) in such an off handed simplistic way leads me to cognitive dissonance.<br/><br/>I cannot reconcile the two different ways you talk about improv jazz on the one hand and semiotic jazz on the other.  I don't get it.  Seriously.  I am at a complete and total loss.<br/><br/>Any enlightenment about the contradiction you offer me that would resolve it would be deeply appreciated.  Until then I don't know what to say...<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Hey David,
<blockquote>I don't think asking them to justify their wording is fruitful. Their wording works for them, to put into their own words how they see things. It does not work as a communication tool for you and me.</blockquote>
I'm not asking for justification, I'm asking for <i>explanation</i>.  In any fruitful discussion there must be an agreed upon foundation.  If that foundation does not exist then there can be no discussion.  IOW we're not talking about the same thing - which means in the end there is no point in even trying to communicate.  If that is indeed the case, that is fine, but the consequence is that we agree that we make no further attempts at communicating as we are wasting each other's time.  Which, to me, is a tragedy but, again, is fine.  But let us honest about that.<br/><br/>I agree, that on one level it is foolish to continue to critique Ron's 15 year old phrase but it's the elephant in the room that just won't die and go away.  So while you and I are talking about Semiotic Jazz in comes this revenant idea that keeps haunting any discussion about this particular topic.  So, do I let it do damage to the nascent thesis and just rudely ignore posters or do I engage?<br/><br/>I'm guessing the subtext here is to disengage.  So be it.
<blockquote>Do you think "linking", "connecting", "weaving", or "resonating" are getting anywhere? Got any better ideas?</blockquote>
As descriptors they all have their place and work just fine in the right place.  However, I offer this caveat.  Any CA that is being hit dead on by the group is going to "resonate" with the players at the table.  I've heard cheering come from Gamist games and tears from Narrativist games.  As process "linking", "connecting" and "weaving" are probably more closely aligned with the process of SJ.  They are all reflective of the process of mythic bricolage and function well with the less-freighted-with-baggage idea of Semiotic Jazz.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Ehn, I assume we all ignore stuff we can't respond to constructively.  Seems normal to me.  But to each their own.<br/><br/>I honestly can't tell whether you and Adam or you and Paul are talking about the same thing.

It's a bad word choice for discussing the player level.  I intended to single it out only with respect to the fictional level.  Like, in a good Narrativist game, what a player does might resonate with the other players' real lives and values and moral interests etc.  In Semiotic Jazz, on the other hand, what a player does might resonate with the group <i>because</i> it resonates with the fiction.<br/><br/>So I guess "fiction-resonant" would be the most accurate term for what I mean.<br/><br/>Hmm, that's not super catchy, is it...

I guess the point really is the meaning-making.  Although if the only relevant way to make meaning in Semiotic Jazz is to forge links, then maybe something like "linking" is sufficient?  "Link-forging", maybe?                        </div>

                            I was thinking about this process of forging links between momentary character action and the larger history of the fiction, and I cooked up some PbtA-style moves.  Jay's group obviously doesn't need these, but for a new group playing in this style, perhaps these might be valuable training wheels, to introduce the appropriate sorts of things to try to contribute?<br/><br/>Five things quickly came to mind:
<ul><li>In a social situation, the character brings up some sort of connection with the person/people they're interacting with, be it a personal bond, a shared ally, a history of cooperation between groups, etc.  These sorts of invocations may matter a great deal to certain people in Spicy Middle Earth.</li>
<li>In a fiction where the characters care about history, this history can be its own special sort of connection.  "The threat is as great as when X happened," "Our best hope is to do like when Y happened," "We're both descended of those who did Z," etc.</li>
<li>Win or lose the immediate fight, a character may sometimes take a stand for something greater, often to set an example, to represent an ideal or a people.  Depending on how it plays out, such a deed may act as future inspiration to others.</li>
<li>When motivated to defend their land or people (which the player must show in action!), a character may find reserves of strength or capability they never knew they had.</li>
<li>Finally, a character may derive confidence from repeating patterns of the glorious or noble past.  Depending on one's take on Middle Earth metaphysics, such patterns may in fact have power of their own.</li></ul>
So, the moves:<br/><br/><b>Invoke a connection</b><br/>10+ plus 2 to Persuade, Inspire or Appeal to history<br/>7-9 plus 1 to Persuade, Inspire or Appeal to history<br/>6- your effort is seen as insincere, desperate or forced; minus 1 to next related roll<br/><br/><b>Appeal to history</b><br/>10+ plus 2 to Persuade, Inspire or Invoke a connection<br/>7-9 plus 1 to Persuade, Inspire or Invoke a connection<br/>6- your effort is seen as insincere, desperate or forced; minus 1 to next related roll<br/><br/><b>Leave your mark</b><br/>10+ will be remembered as an example, giving +1 to those who use it in Appeal to History<br/>7-9 will be remembered - if you prevail, as 10+ above; if you fail, as a -1 cautionary tale<br/>6- time will forget what you do here<br/><br/><b>Defend your land or people</b><br/>10+ plus 2 for rest of encounter<br/>7-9 plus 1 for rest of encounter<br/>6- the threat to your land/people is worse than you knew<br/><br/><b>Walk in the footsteps of giants</b><br/>10+ plus 2 to emulate their successes and avoid their failures<br/>7-9 plus 2 to emulate their successes, -2 to avoid their failures<br/>6- their enemies and weaknesses come to plague you<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>

                            Jay,<br/><br/>I was just using "Right to Dream" and other Forge jargon as shorthand to refer to many countless discussions about that kind of play, believing mistakenly that you understood it as such and would be able to unpack it. <br/><br/>It's also shorthand for the kind of play I described a few times in this thread, so I'm not sure repeating myself is very interesting or useful for anyone. As David says, that's not likely to be much of a fruitful approach.<br/><br/> </div>

                            All role-play builds collective semantic meaning in the way that Jay talks about. It's basically what "Shared Imagined Space" is all about, after all. I just think that Jay's group plays in a way that puts additional emphasis on that aspect of play over others.<br/><br/>The question Creative Agenda tried to answer is, "How does a functional play group decide what is good play?" and to a lesser extent, "How does a member of a functional play group decide what is good input into play?" When all the stars are aligned, when all cylinders are firing in the proper sequence, you get a kind of magic at the table.                         </div>

This is the crux of the discussion, isn't it? That's what I was referring to earlier when I asked if Ron's "exporation squared" is essentially what we're talking about here.<br/><br/>I definitely see "resonant fiction" in an ongoing dungeon crawl in the sense being discussed here, but it's a low priority - when it happens, it's great, but if it doesn't happen for a while (maybe even several sessions), we don't care, because we're focused on other things.<br/><br/>I suppose you *could* have an old-school dungeon crawl with pretty much no "resonance" happening whatsoever (like this,<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18249/the-osr-in-vivid-colour-an-actual-play" rel="nofollow"> somewhat ironically Lord of the Rings example</a>, unless humour counts as "resonance"), so perhaps it is *possible*, and that's what matters for questions of theory (?).                        </div>

Neat!!!<br/><br/>Your five thing is a wonderful description of the masculine, honor/tradition bounded warrior type society which we can see a multiple times in history (Also, to me, this is very 300esque, and very close to what I refer to as 'epic' - but I'm aware that epic also means a lot of different things.)<br/><br/>I will <i>definitely</i> use this PbtA principle wise!                        </div>

                            (I'm also interested in that discussion, so include me if it happens.)<br/><br/>(For what it's worth, my initial reaction is the same as Adam's, but I can see some potential for teasing things out, as well - basically, if "resonance" is about reinforcing some kind of elements of the "Standard", in the same way that Narrativist play addresses themes, then we can at least *imagine* play where that fails to happen.)<br/><br/>(The interesting question for the purposes of this thread is how to identify those elements. In Tolkien, this has a lot to do with history, heroism, good and evil, and diminishing over time, perhaps. I don't know; it's worth pondering.)                        </div>

                            We had a face-to-face discussion of this issue today, and I settled somewhat on the balance of "consonance" (or resonance) and "expansion" as elements of the "celebration" of the material.<br/><br/>I'll let David chime in if he has thoughts on this, or takeaways from the topic.<br/><br/>The basic gist is that much of the enjoyment has to do with dealing with fictional material, creating new content which resonates with or is consonant with the material established so far, and enjoying the ability to expand that material's scope while maintaining that consonance. As a result, the material itself grows and develops, and being an active participant in that is a joy as well as highly satisfying.<br/><br/>Balancing "consonance" and "expansion" is an important part of the skills being used.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>I'll leave this short note here in case it spurs further discussion as well as a reminder to myself, later.<br/><br/>As a musician, it also works reasonably well for me as a "jazz metaphor", alongside what Jay's been doing with those terms.<br/><br/>Most importantly, these ideas can at least start to be turned into actual tools and techniques, which is a promising idea.                        </div>

                            The jazz metaphor gives me a few ideas on what players might do -- some tools in their toolkit at any given moment as they look to maximize their contributions in relation to some "standard".  In rough order from emphasizing consonance to emphasizing expansion:<br/>- <b>perfect</b> - do the obvious to perfection (aesthetic satisfaction of skillful execution) (hit every note in the melody purely and on time)<br/>- <b>amplify</b> - do it bigger and louder (ramp up the emotional experience) (hit that overdrive distortion pedal!)<br/>- <b>tweak</b> - provide a new angle on the expected (novelty, specificity) (play that wailing melody staccato instead)<br/>- <b>twist</b> - provide an unexpected twist (surprise, curiosity) (instead of beginning the segue back into the main theme, take the jam farther afield)<br/>- <b>shock</b> - incorporate the counterintuitive (surprise and challenge) (go nuts on a quiet standard, lay back on a rockin' standard)<br/><br/>In the example of negotiating with Elves about Balrogs, I think Jay's doing a bunch of these simultaneously and doesn't need his options called out in this manner.  But, again, for purposes of introduction/instruction, I wonder if this sort of breakdown could be useful.<br/><br/>So a newcomer might see "perfect/amplify/tweak/twist/shock" and think:<br/>- ask the elves for help as best befits this character in this situation, using maximum eloquence<br/>- break into tears while asking the elves for help, showing how hard "OMG Balrog" hits you<br/>- compare the slow-to-help elf lord to Isildur shirking his responsibility to destroy the Ring<br/>- swear yourself to the elves' service forever if you successfully deal with the Balrog together<br/>- go after the Balrog yourself and offer to duel any elf who stands in your way, hoping to shame them with your superior courage and determination                        </div>

                            I like where that is going, as well. I'm not sure your examples illustrate the idea as well as you might wish, but the basic premise here is solid. It might be interesting to create a mini-game out of such prompts, for a proof of concept (kind of like you've done earlier in this thread, but to actually play).                        </div>

                            Greetings gentlemen!<br/><br/>David,<br/><br/>You list of prospective "mechanics" is plenty workable as long as the following "instructions" are included.<br/><br/>1.  The list of mechanics is not a comprehensive list of all possible ways that a situation can be approached.  IOW - the list isn't meant to limit player creativity/input to those examples only.<br/>2.  The list of mechanics are indeed "training wheels" and <i>will</i> atrophy in time.  IOW - they aren't truly resolution mechanics at all but rather pointers to a few of the ways the "world" works.<br/>3.  Include a primer on bricolage/SJ.<br/><br/>What you really want the players doing is engaging in the expressiveness, creativity and discipline of semiotic improv jazz.  We don't want the players getting hung up on reifying what is essentially a mere exemplar pointer.  (You know the hoary old adage - "Don't mistake the finger pointing to the moon for the moon")<br/><br/>Other than the above it's all good.<br/><br/>I don't know if you realized (I'm guessing you did but it bears noting anyway) that the very specifics of the mechanics you developed were drawn from my table's particular interpretation of LoTR.  IOW the mechanics reflect the source material.  This means each published game will have to have its own set of "rules" dependent of the source material <i>and</i> what the players are grooving on from the source material.  IOW each table is going to develop, over long periods of play, its own set of "mechanics".  (Just so you know, just typing mechanics wrt to SJ makes my fingers itch and my eyes twitch <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=":wink:"/> )  There can be no GURPS style "universal mechanics" system.<br/><br/>Paul,
<blockquote>Balancing "consonance" and "expansion" is an important part of the skills being used.</blockquote>
Absolutely!  Too much "consonance" and one might as well be playing directly off of sheet music.  Too much expansion and you lose the "Standard" altogether.  It <i>is</i> a critical skill.  This is the primary reason why our table has a "vetting" process, as it were.  A new player is invited to play with a rough explanation of how we play.  A regular player is "assigned" to the new player to "mentor" him/her along.  By limiting it to one or two new players at any given time the new player can see how the experienced players are playing and what expected play looks like.  ("Expected" is a terrible word for what I'm trying to express, but I'm a little fuzzy headed at the moment).  Too many new players and the reference for the play style gets muddled.  It's actually surprisingly easy to see who has a "spark" and will likely do well in time from those who don't.  I will admit there are, in all probability, false negatives but that will forever remain unknown to us.
<blockquote>I feel like importing other metaphors, cliches, or tropes (and "transposing" them into that context, if we're really obsessed with musical terms for some reason) could be useful in this style of play, too.</blockquote>
By all means.  We're talking about a process that isn't well represented in Western thinking and less so in its vocabulary.  If it helps, it helps!
<blockquote>"The Last Ringbearer" comes to mind as an examply of spy fiction in the Middle Earth universe (although that twists the Tolkien material into something almost unrecognizable, compared to Jay's groups far more faithful rendition), as well.</blockquote>
That may indeed be the case, but if that is what a given table is grooving on, then there is absolutely nothing to prevent that work from being used as the "Standard".
<blockquote>For instance, what if I make reference to the David vs. Goliath story from the Bible, reframing it as a situation in Tolkienesque terms - a hobbit taking down a cave troll with a pebble to its forehead, perhaps, or flinging a Silmaril into the face of a Balrog?<br/><br/>Jay, would that kind of thing contribute to "resonance" or "rightness" in your game, or be an unwelcome intrusion?</blockquote>
We try to keep our verbiage consistent with Tolkien's writings but sometimes it just doesn't work out that way and another reference is used.  It does happen on occasion.  If it happens frequently then one would have to wonder if said player really understood the "Standard".<br/><br/>As an aside, is not LoTR an instance of the David vs. Goliath story?  Was it not Sam or Frodo who were the "least" who stood off against the greatest Goliath in Middle Earth?  At least thematically?  This is why you're particular example would not have been met with too much resistance at the table.  It is precisely because they are such similar themes that even using a straight "David vs Goliath" expression would likely fly without too much distress.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                         </div>

                            Hey Everyone,<br/><br/>I thought I'd just throw this out for some thinkin' upon.  Long ago there was a thread entitled <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=13560.0" rel="nofollow">On RPGs and Text [LONG]</a>.  Its dense - or at least dense for me.  There is still much I need to work out about it, but the idea I wanted to point to was in a written work of fiction the part that we interact with is not the text put what a theorist called "syuzhet."  I'd define the word here but the original post spent many words explaining the concept.  And the poster was intimately knowledgeable on the topic and I don't fully grasp it, yet.  Don't get hung up on the actual word but the general concept behind it.  Something Paul mentioned and what Dave has been working on both deal with this concept.<br/><br/>The "syuzhet" of a piece of fiction is the affective aspect that we feel when reading or recalling a piece of text.  IOW (I think) its that part of the process where we react and feel about the work.  I mention this only because when discussing SJ "standard" wrt to role-playing we're not really recalling the words per say, but those things that the reading of text made us feel - or "resonated" within us.  (That's for you Dave! <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> )<br/><br/>I think this is important because this "syuzhet" experience is what we're trying to bring to life in our port over of a piece of fiction to an RPG.  We truly cannot "play" the source text.  It's the affective experience we had that we're looking to recreate.  This isn't to say the Setting isn't important, not so.  But rather, I believe, if we're trying to play in Middle Earth (FREX) it is in syuzhet that we need to mine.  That also means that any mechanics that we wish to design must also follow out of the syuzhet.<br/><br/>In using the jazz analogy, its that dimension of the Standard that moves and excites the soloist.  I'm not referring to the sheet music but the actual aural experience that moves us interiorally.<br/><br/>I don't know if this adds or helps in any way.  It's just something that's been percolating in my mind the last day or two.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Hey Paul,<br/><br/>I actually did a partial recording of a session we played about a week ago.  The recording was done on an iPhone so the quality isn't that good, but one uses the tools at hand.  It's about 2.25 hours long and about 123MB.  PM with your email and I'll share the link on my Google Drive with you.<br/><br/>Three things regarding the session.<br/><br/>1.  This is the first time we've played in about 8 months so we're pretty rusty.<br/>2.  I started the recording about 15-30 minutes into the session.  The DM may seem to be stepping on player agency a bit but it is a method of "drawing back the bow" on the session.  Once out of the opening phases of the night (which may take an hour or two depending on many factors - not least of which is the amount of time since our last play session) this is then throttled down.<br/>3.  This session ran somewhere between 8-10 hours which allows for a long "intro", as it were.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Hey Paul,
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It seems that any given player might play more than one character in this game. Can you tell us a bit about how this works?</p></div></blockquote>
The playing of multiple characters in a given nights gaming session is a relatively rare event.  I'm not sure that I recall anytime this has happened at a players specific request.  If memory serves the triggering event is usually the return to play after a lengthy hiatus.  I don't know my DM's mind on this but I propose this is a way to refresh our relationship with the "world" and its events by touching on one or more characters in and around the world before settling in for the night's session.  I also believe it also serves to whet our appetites as we are "reintroduced" to our characters and their various stories.<br/><br/>Sometimes this is done to tie up loose ends such that a given character can be broken out of a previously played scenario and make them available for other scenarios.  This can be due to a scenario that stalled out because we had new players that are no longer with the group.  Sometimes a character needs some screen time to complete some important task but is not associated with other PCs so time is alloted for the event and then the rest of the night is spent with another character that <i>is</i> involved with other PCs.<br/><br/>I'm sure there are other reasons but I can't recall any specifically at the moment.  Did that shed any light at all?
<blockquote>How often do you switch characters within a campaign?</blockquote>
All the time?  We don't play "adventuring companies" so we don't have campaigns in the most commonly used sense of the world.  I suppose it could be said that we've been playing the same "campaign" in Middle Earth for 40+ years.  That is, this "campaign" is not a specific story but the movement of <i>all</i> Middle Earth towards the war of the ring.  Each player develops a folio of characters which grows ever larger as we play.  My folder currently holds 24 characters stretching from a First Age Vanyar Elf, a Dunedain, a Paredhel, a Dwarf of the Withered Heath all the way down to a common human street thief, a human member of a crime syndicate and a simple nomadic bow hunter.  I've got an exotic - a "Pocket Dragon" who had resided in Aman from before the time of the Two Trees.  There are many reasons for this folio.  One cannot play the same character for 40 years (or ~25 years in my case) without growing bored.<br/><br/>Middle is a BIG place.  There are many peoples and it should be experienced from many perspectives.  Playing different characters allows a player to taste great power while reminding the player of just how great the heights of power are when life is experienced from the eyes of a humble street urchin.  An elf is going to have a different perspective on the unfolding events of ME as would a Dunedain as would a barbarian as would an Istari as would a man of the Harad.  These shifts in perspective keep the game experience fresh and lively.<br/><br/>Along the same lines we don't play "adventuring companies".  We play characters.  Each one is unique, has his own history, desires, goals, competencies, etc.  Yes there are cultural norms within which each character must navigate the world but in the end each is his own, to find his own way.  Sometimes some characters will stay together for a period of time but usually personal goals or events will cause them to drift apart over time as they chase each their own goals.  This is why our sessions frequently have relatively long intros as the DM is pulling the various characters together and getting them involved in the night's scenario.  This does not mean that all the characters are there for the same reason.  That is actually fairly rare.  Rather we might all be involved in an event or location for very different reasons which makes for some really challenging and ultimately deeply satisfying play.  During the course of a night each player could potentially have (and frequently does have) a completely different gaming experience.
<blockquote>How do we decide which characters are worth playing?</blockquote>
In the end all our characters are "worth" playing!  Each is a different flavor.  This doesn't mean we don't have favorites but the game experience is so personalized that we can have an 18th level half-elf and a first level human character and one would not diminish the experience of the other.  That being said, if there is a character that we're hankering play we'll talk to the DM about it between games.  This works best if the reason why you're wanting to play a specific character also comes with some goal that you're trying to achieve.  This helps the DM build scenarios.  The more you give the DM character motivation wise the likelier it is for a given character to be played.
<blockquote>Do you ever play minor characters (or non-recurring characters)?</blockquote>
Sure.  While I have 24 characters in my folder about half are played substantially less often than others.  I have my unique "pocket dragon" that rarely sees play but is a lot of fun to play.  Sometimes we'll play a one off where any any experience we pick up (if we survive) can be transferred to another character in our folder.  One time I was given the opportunity to play the major opposition NPC for a night.  That was a rawking blast!  I was given the general background of the NPC and his motivations and cut loose.  Occasionally the DM would have the character do something he wanted to have happen but that was something that only happened two or three times that night.  The character died at the end of the night as was explained to me ahead of the game, but it was really fun playing this irredeemable bastard.<br/><br/>Not long before I joined the group all the players played field mice in a scenario that lasted 3-4 hours.  I was also told that over 30 years ago one player played a sand crab for a few hours.<br/><br/>When we haven't played for a while we do like to play our preferred characters.  But if we've been playing regularly then we do like to move to some of our minor characters or trying something pretty far off the reservation.<br/><br/>I don't know if anything I've written has been helpful or enlightening in any way.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Very. Playing together is much like what I hear of amateur traditional ensembles. The semiotic part is for the soli mostly, but the least skillfull still beat the tempo.<br/>Characters as viewpoints is great. Without player resources other than their social credit, I wonder what agency was left for the sand crab.

                            That is a fantastic and enlightening answer, Jay! Wonderful. Lots to get at there, and very interesting. Thank you!<br/><br/>A further question:<br/><br/>You keep speaking of "the GM's scenario". Reading between the lines, it sounds like Cary plans a specific events or series of events, and then uses some "cutscenes" with a variety of characters to set it up or to give it a large room context. Does that sound about right?<br/><br/>What are "scenarios" like, and how open-ended or scripted are they?<br/><br/>It seems telling that the NPC you played had a fate (their death) which the GM knew before the game even began, for instance. That suggests some careful planning, which would be a good fit with the procedures of Spicy Dice play.<br/><br/>Are the scenes involving other characters a way to touch on them (so we don't forget about their experience), a way to show the possible impact of the events in question on the world at large, or something else?<br/><br/>I realize I'm asking you questions now about the GM's methods, which you might not have answers to. But, if you know, or have a guess, let me know!                        </div>

                            Hi DeReel,
<blockquote>Without player resources other than their social credit, I wonder what agency was left for the sand crab. Like if it was a tailor made situation with a wall to climb and a rope to cut, or if it was just viewpoint.</blockquote>
I don't remember much of the story as it was told to me long ago but while I was pondering your musings a thought or two did float up.  One was that the situation was tailor made for the sandcrab.  I think he had to protect his territory from other sandcrabs, went hunting for other shells and perhaps had to avoid a predator.<br/><br/>You know, a day in the life of a sandcrab!  <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> This was back when the DM was living on the Eastern Seaboard and they would play several times a week but much shorter sessions.  This made taking a little bit of time away from ME was much less of a loss of opportunity than today when time between games can sometimes be measured in seasons of a year.<br/><br/>The field mice scenario was tied into ME as they mice were avoiding and taunting an extremely young and thus clumsy Great Eagle as it was learning to fly and hunt.  The Great Eagle was a special character for a player and that scenario was his introduction into play.<br/><br/>I apologize that I wasn't clear about what was what.  My post was getting long - yet again.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Hey Paul,

I use the word "scenario" poorly and out of habit. The problem is I don't know of a better word of vocabulary to employ.<br/><br/>Back when we played frequently the DM would often sit down at the table ask the players what characters they wanted to play and generate the game on the fly.<br/><br/>Now that we play far less frequently the DM will spend time ahead of time generating NPC's, some motivations, a bit of scene framing and possibly what is now called a kicker so that the game begins with an impetus.  Rarely is anything fixed as far as what the characters must do.  But the world will roll on and the NPC's will do what they are motivated to do whether or not we choose to involve ourselves or not.  I think back at the Forge I posted in the AP boards about when a dragon attacked Rivendale.  One could argue that was specific event that was going to happen, period.  Several year prior the DM hinted something terrible was about to happen when a player's character, an Istari, had a "vision" of himself riding in all haste towards Rivendell looking over his shoulder with a look of horror on his face.  That was all we got and it was the last thing to happen on the week long gaming retreat we were on.  What a cliffhanger!!<br/><br/>Several years later when we finally got back to the event that the PC had seen in his vision was a dragon crashing into Rivendell. Long afterwards the DM had mentioned that he had waited 30 years to play out that "scenario".  I guess that could be called a "specific event" but again it was more kicker than programmed plot.  But consider, not too long before in game time, Turindir had slain Elrond's sons and grandsons in a terrible moment with Gurthang.  For all his losses Elrond, brother to Elros first king of the Numenoreans who chose the mortal way and had been dead for nearly the entirety of the second and third ages would not forsake the Dunedain who had been living within the bounds of his demesne.  Bilbo was also in residence.  I had a character who was near and moving towards Rivendale in a completely unrelated scenario as was (PC) Turil, half-elven, in yet another completely unrelated scenario.<br/><br/>So over the course of years and wildly different scenarios/game sessions the DM had been slowly maneuvering PC's into position for this hugely calamitous event.  Mind you there was little that could be done to stop the dragon.  Even the player of the Istari, who threw everything he had into 10x strength lightning bolt, dropping 10 "tomahawk 20's" merely caused it a scratch.  An important scratch that would come into play later but did nothing at the time to slow it down.  Elrond decided to retreat out of Rivendell and we headed down to Moria to seek refuge.  In the same session all the Dunedain, under Aragorn (less one PC Dunedain who quarreled with Aragorn and refused to go) who had foreseen the need to pass through Moria to Durin's Gates at the west end.  So in the same "scenario" we are elves retreating from a Dragon to Moria and Dunedain desperately fighting our way through Moria for whatever awaited us.<br/><br/>In the end both parties met in the cavern just inside Durin's Gate.  On one side was the Dragon and thousands of Orc and on the Moria side were many hundreds more of Orc.  Now we get back to Bilbo and Turindir.  Though grievously wounded from the "scenario" where in the end he had slain Elrond's scions, he made the trek to Moria with us.  When coming to after losing consciousness Bilbo presented him with Gurthang "thinking he might have need".  Gurthang, if you recall was the most powerful magic sword created in the whole history of Middle Earth and as we played it, it loathed dragons.  In short Turindir demands the gates opened, he exits and orcs flee the sword and approaches Durudin, the Dragon.  The dragon tries to beguile Turindir but due to the "scratch" to his eye delivered to him by the PC Istari earlier in the night, Durudin's ability is vastly diminished and Turindir shakes off the attempt.  Stepping forward with the Sword the Dragon recoils but sword that was embedded in heel of its foot (when it stepped on and killed a PC earlier in the night) caused it to lose balance and it rolled forward as the sword was thrust upward.  Both Durudin and Turindir perished.  (Turindir's player back east, 30+ years ago) had been told when he picked up the sword that it would betray him 3 times ere Turindir's end. This was the 3rd time.)<br/><br/>In all of the games I've played this was the most "plotted" I've ever played, by a looooong way.  I would say the Dragon attack, both parties heading to the same place and the Death of the Dragon and Turindir were plotted.  While this was the largest world event that I had witnessed, it did feel a bit forced in my heart.  Both my elf and my Dunedain could have freely refused their roles but I would have missed out on something terribly world shaking.  I had complete freedom to play my characters as I saw fit, yet I felt the resolution was a bit Deus Ex Machina.  Aside from this very unusual event saving our collective bacons' is our own jobs.  Which isn't to say that death wasn't a real possibility.  One of the PC's had died to the Dragon when he was stepped on.<br/><br/>Like I said, this was an extreme outlier.  I was instructed by the DM when I took my hand at running for a while to make a sheet with quadrants.  One section would hold the list of PC's.  Another would hold at least one "test" per PC incase I couldn't think of anything on the fly.  Yet another a list of encounters that the PC's might run into incase I couldn't think of anything on the fly.  The last was list of possible treasures or other interesting finds.<br/><br/>Ugh...blathered and gone waaaaaaaaaaay off topic.  Sorry Paul.  I'll come back to your post when I can and try to answer directly.  I'd delete this outright but I've put a lot of time into it and maybe a few nuggets can be sifted from the dross.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

Jay,<br/><br/>This is very important and something I have missed about Sim play for a long time. I am not sure that it's <i>universal</i> about Sim play or if it's only a priority when your Sim play is related to some external reference like <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. I suspect it's universal in some way though!<br/><br/>Is this the first time you've seen this syuzhet idea expressed in the context of Sim play? It is for me.<br/><br/>My interpretation of what you said is this:<br/><br/><i>Reading Lord of the Rings made you feel a certain way. You want to get back there through an RPG, so all of your game techniques are designed to reignite that spark.</i><br/><br/>How's that?                        </div>

I think the way Cary and the group worked failed attempts and prior events into the resolution of a larger event is a really neat technique (and seems like a perfect example of bricolage).<br/><br/>I'm going to reread it later!                        </div>

                            Jay is using "syuzhet" in a new way, different from the usual meaning from Russian formalism, where <i>syuzhet</i> means the technique of the story, or the way the plot elements are organized. <br/><br/>Jay: "The 'syuzhet' of a piece of fiction is the affective aspect that we feel when reading or recalling a piece of text."<br/><br/>That's a total misuse of the Russian formalism term (which is its own bit of jargon), but it's good enough for me, because he defined it.<br/><br/>In English, we call this "getting lost in a story" or more formally, "transportation." I feel like the word "nostalgia" ought to do the trick, too, though that has melancholy connotations that don't apply.<br/> </div>

                            Hey Adam,
<blockquote>That's a total misuse of the Russian formalism term (which is its own bit of jargon), but it's good enough for me, because he defined it.</blockquote>
Whoops.  Well <i>THAT'S</i> embarrassing! <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/><br/>I knew that my grasp of the meaning of the word was tenuous but I hadn't figured on being completely wrong.  Ugh...

It would have to be for me since that was the first time I ever used "syuzhet" in a post! <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/>   I've never even seen it used outside of a thread from long ago that explored the idea of textuality and RPG's.  I linked to the thread in an earlier post.  I guess my complete misunderstanding helped in the end?  I've never studied semiotics or the like, but I've been thinking on what it was that we're trying to capture in our games.  I'm not married to the word and if a better word exists that is more accessible to readers without a bunch of connotative baggage I'm all for it.  However, if it works then lets run with it.
<blockquote>My interpretation of what you said is this:<br/><br/><i>Reading Lord of the Rings made you feel a certain way. You want to get back there through an RPG, so all of your game techniques are designed to reignite that spark.</i><br/><br/>How's that?</blockquote>
Absolutely, ten ring, perfect!
<blockquote><blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">@Silmenume</a> said:<br/>The "syuzhet" of a piece of fiction is the affective aspect that we feel when reading or recalling a piece of text. <br/><br/>. . .<br/><br/>I think this is important because this "syuzhet" experience is what we're trying to bring to life in our port over of a piece of fiction to an RPG. We truly cannot "play" the source text.</blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> said -<br/>This is very important and something I have missed about Sim play for a long time. I am not sure that it's universal about Sim play or if it's only a priority when your Sim play is related to some external reference like Lord of the Rings. I suspect it's universal in some way though!</blockquote>
Though I've only recently formally stated the thesis, it's an idea that's been bumping around in my brain box for quite some time.  I'm operating, for now, on the idea that it is universal to see where it takes the conversation.  However, I do see the idea haunting an awful lot of posts (but not clearly articulated) about what people are trying to grasp at when trying to design or play in that CA.  We'll see if the idea holds, eh?<br/><br/>It is rather essential to my Semitoic Jazz analogy.  What is it about the aural experience of the Standard the we are so excited about and want to riff on?  Moving over to fiction it becomes, what is it about the source fiction that we are so excited to experience again in play?<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Hey Paul,<br/><br/>I'm going to revisit this question as a conversation I had with my DM not long ago came back to me...
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>You keep speaking of "the GM's scenario". Reading between the lines, it sounds like Cary plans a specific events or series of events, and then uses some "cutscenes" with a variety of characters to set it up or to give it a large room context. Does that sound about right?</p></div></blockquote>
I don't recall how I formulated the question to my DM but I discovered his usage of "scenario" was very different from what I had assumed.  I used "scenario" to refer to the events in a given night's play.  His usage was turned a complete 180 degrees around from what I had understood.  His "scenarios" are the major peoples, powers and cultures of the world and what <i>they</i> are doing.  In essence his "scenarios" are what is happening in the whole known world quantified into a useful structure.  From these "structures" are born characters and/or a given night's general outline/location/kickers.
<blockquote>What are "scenarios" like, and how open-ended or scripted are they?</blockquote>
That is a very difficult question to parse and answer.  Sometime's an evening's "scenario" is group oriented (think a unit of Ithilien Rangers) yet far more frequently an evening's "scenario" is a congregation of individuals who happen to be at the same place for various differing reasons.  It's tough to explain and I'll have to think back on specific games and give a list of examples.  Typically the initial scene framing is fairly tightly scripted.  The antagonist NPC's are considered and given motivations and resources so that they can be played as game play developments dictate.  Sometimes the DM will have some ideas about a character's development and put those into motion during the evening's play while leaving the player free to choose how and in what manner to respond.<br/><br/>So I guess it could be said the openings of "scenarios" are heavily scripted with some events prepared but not inevitable while play itself tends to be very open-ended.  This doesn't mean the DM doesn't try to influence but the players have tremendous freedom.  Once I described this a such.<br/><br/>The Player's have much say over their character's but the DM does sometimes lay direct claim.<br/>The DM has much say over Setting but players' do sometimes lay direct claim.<br/><br/>Ha!  Now I remember!  His philosophy regarding "scenarios" is simple plot, complex characters.  IOW get the scene framing done so the characters have a vested interest, let the NPC's work on their plans and then turn up the heat.  Many times he'll include an NPC or two in a group just so he can use them to stir the pot if the pacing starts to flag.
<blockquote>It seems telling that the NPC you played had a fate (their death) which the GM knew before the game even began, for instance. That suggests some careful planning, which would be a good fit with the procedures of Spicy Dice play.</blockquote>
I'm not sure how to answer this as I don't know exactly just how much thought he really expends prepping for a game.  By nature he's extremely improvisational and is incredible for thinking outside the box.  IOW he's an excellent bricoleur.  Ironically he's terrible at Western style analytical thought.  In this particular scenario the NPC I played died to an event that he had set into motion long ago in the "scenario".  The NPC I played and three others had all killed the original gold miners in what would eventually become the hamlet.  After getting the various PC's in place the game began with the death of one the children of the original four murderers.  For the character I was playing the story was his decline and fall as the revenants of the murdered took their justice.  So in a way it wasn't intended so much as a pre-planned plot moment as much as the natural outcome of the motives of the revenants.  I don't know if I'm splitting hairs or making semantic arguments or not.  You'll have to tell me.  I will say that each individual PC is considered so that at one point or another during the night they will have their "test"/moment to shine.<br/><br/>I hope this sheds some more light.  (Much of what I'm writing is either me recalling that which was long forgotten or me just figuring something out while on the keyboard.)<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

I think I would tend to agree.  It is a technique well suited to for running a looooong campaign.  I also agree that it is indeed a <i>technique</i> and not a <i>process of play</i>.  My concern would be how to handle character death or that characters, unless held firm by some sort of unbreakable bond, will drift apart.<br/><br/>One would think they are natural and sensible approaches but one just doesn't hear about it.  Point in fact your post is the first time I've ever read anyone else doing such a thing.

Fair enough.  You're the game designer and I defer to your wisdom, but allow me one last concern.  Task resolution mechanics "modelling the physics of the world" is a design paradigm that is over 40 years old and is still employed by the largest game publisher out there right now.  This isn't even the largest problem, SJ (mythic bricolage) is a type of thinking process that is <i>utterly lost to the West</i>.  While it can be easy to pick up watching others play explaining, to readers, where text itself has been held up as sacrosanct, such "mechanics" are frequently treated as inalterable.  Akin to describing music without an audio device so it can actually be listened to.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it has to be theory with jargon but ingrained cultural habits are hard to think past.<br/><br/>However, I'd say, you've been doing a wonderful job! I look forward to seeing your next efforts.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

I think I would tend to agree.  It is a technique well suited to for running a looooong campaign.  I also agree that it is indeed a <i>technique</i> and not a <i>process of play</i>.  My concern would be how to handle character death or that characters, unless held firm by some sort of unbreakable bond, will drift apart.<br/><br/>One would think they are natural and sensible approaches but one just doesn't hear about it.  Point in fact your post is the first time I've ever read anyone else doing such a thing.</div></blockquote>
I've always been interested in this, too. I've tried it, and have seen other people try, but I'm not sure I've ever seen anyone really pull it off. <br/><br/>(Two exceptions I can think of are Vincent Baker's free form <i>Ars Magica</i> game, which he's written about some, and the D&amp;D campaign I played with Eero [another poster on this forum], which also had multiple GMs.)<br/><br/>I was working on a game called <i>Inconceivable</i> for a while, which was designed to do this on a shorter timescale. I'm still unsure whether it was a success or not, but it was fun and interesting to try!<br/><br/>A published game which shares some features of this approach is <i>In a Wicked Age...</i>, which does really lovely things in a long-term campaign.<br/><br/>A Finnish designer, Petteri Hannila, is working on <i>The Varangian Way</i>, which is a game specifically designed to do this kind of "exploring an enormous world through a variety of character perspectives", but apparently he's finding it incredibly difficult to make that work.<br/><br/>I have a question for you, Jay:<br/><br/><i>"My concern would be how to handle character death or that characters, unless held firm by some sort of unbreakable bond, will drift apart."</i><br/><br/>I'm trying to understand what your concerns are, here, but I can't quite follow this sentence. Can you maybe describe a quick example of how you see character death or characters drifting apart would hurt the game?<br/><br/>It seems to *me* that characters dying and drifting apart is precisely something this format of play would handle better than other ways of structuring a game... so I must be missing something!                        </div>

My concern was that to <i>not</i> use the technique (i.e., to not use "Troupe play", to borrow a term from <a href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">@hamnacb</a> ) would lead to problems in a long term "campaign" under the circumstances of character death or characters drifting apart.

Aside from Vincent and Eero could you describe why you feel those other games fell short of the desired goal?<br/><br/>On the other hand would you describe why or how Vincent (and if you can provide a link to the posts about his <i>Ars Magica</i> game) and Eero succeeded?<br/><br/>I think the contrast and compare might be illuminating.  I know I am asking for a lot of effort on your part, but I you could find your way to do so I would be mightily pleased!<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Jay,<br/><br/>I've been thinking about this discussion for some time, and I realized I never answered your question here. The reason is that, perhaps, I don't really have a clear answer. I can't think of any particular and obvious reason for failure in those campaigns; I've just never seen someone actually pull it off. The social challenges (scheduling, etc), the logistical challenge of remembering what's happening and where and to who, the interest the players have in particular characters but not others... I've not seen a group overcome that yet, but I see no reason for it not to work, in theory (as it seems to be, in your game).<br/><br/>However, I did just remember another example. Unfortunately, it's a long time ago, and I only participated in a handful of sessions, so I can't speak to it too much. I had a friend who ran a long-term Star Wars campaign (using the WEG rules, for what that's worth), and had players occasionally dropping in and out of the game.<br/><br/>A clever thing he did was to make all new players take on the roles of minor NPCs who had already been established. It led to lots of interesting long-term developments across the tapestry of the campaign, as minor characters got reincorporated and then further developed. Like your game, it was heavily GM-guided, as opposed to handled through the initiative of the players, who were responsible for playing those characters faithfully within scenes and storylines, but not in any real sense in charge of creating the characters or the storylines themselves.<br/><br/>However, that game also used a fair bit of D&amp;D-style "PC glow" to function. (What I mean by the expression "PC glow" is that the players all reacted to characters differently depending on whether they were PCs or NPCs. So, for example, when I joined I (and another player who just joined) took on the roles of two thieves/burglars who had broken into the other PCs' demesne and were caught red-handed. However, now that those burglars were recreated as PCs, we were let out of our cells and invited to participate in their adventures, instead (something they would presumably never have done if the burglars had remained NPCs). This worked well in that particular game, but I can also imagine it being very jarring in other games or for other gamers.<br/><br/>Which brings up an interesting question:<br/><br/>Jay, in your campaign, how often (if ever) do PCs end up at odds, as opponents, fighting against each other? If so, is it handled any differently (in terms of mechanics, rules, or the way the GM adjudicates outcomes)?                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">@Silmenume</a>, I do have a question (forgive me if this has been answered, this thread is quite lengthy!). Does the game have any rigidly-defined subsystems that are used? Think like D&amp;D's combat: roll initiative, then you can move up to your speed and perform one action plus one bonus action (and those actions are Attack, Dash, Shove, etc.).<br/><br/>If so, would you mind detailing them? If not, how do you handle conflict resolution in a way that leaves the players satisfied?                        </div>

                            From what I've seen/heard, there are no formal subsystems at all, except for a "skill checks" system, which looks more like a loose experience system (it doesn't appear to factor into an kind of resolution, but just act as descriptive tracking on paper).<br/><br/>But that's precisely why I'm curious how PC vs. PC conflicts might be handled!<br/><br/>Jay will, of course, correct me if I'm wrong.                        </div>

                            Paul,
<blockquote> Like your game, it was heavily GM-guided, as opposed to handled through the initiative of the players, who were responsible for playing those characters faithfully within scenes and storylines, but not in any real sense in charge of creating the characters or the storylines themselves.</blockquote>
I'm going to ask a question that I should wait for a response to before responding to this but I'm going to be foolish and bull ahead anyway.  So here's the question - What do you mean by "in charge of creating the character[s]"?  Do you mean <i>character creation</i> during roll up or do mean <i>character development</i> through play or both?<br/><br/>I'm going to tentatively take the meaning of <i>character development</i>, but definitely tell me if I misunderstood you.  During play it is definitely up to the players to determine how they have their PC's respond to the situations.  How we respond is character development.  Given that the GM is primarily responsible for the world that means he has primary responsibility for generating situation.  This can make it difficult but not impossible to make a radical change in character but such changes had best make some sort of sense.  IOW there needs to some sort of rationale even if it is entirely emotional.  Outside of game we can talk to the DM about where we're looking to go with our characters so he can incorporate the proper situations into the next scenario with that particular PC.<br/><br/>WRT creating storylines again I'm going to have to ask if you can give me an example of what you mean.  Every decision we make creates the storyline.  I will agree our GM employs aggressive "scene (scenario) framing" in the opening of a game session but after we're rolling that opens up quite a bit.  Yes once the all chess pieces are laid out and put into play we are constrained by what's before us but we are free to choose what to do given the circumstances.  Yes the freedom of our characters to choose is also constrained by who our characters are, but if they weren't they wouldn't be identifiable characters.  FREX - John McClane in Die Hard did not choose to be in a building that would be taken over by thieves.  Nor did he in the beginning choose to confront the bad guys as he first tried to use the phones to call for help and when that didn't work he used the fire alarm system.  We learn about who and what John is capable of as the story progresses.  The progression of which is affected by his choices and actions.<br/><br/>Given how infrequently we play nowadays the GM tries to make the game big and exciting which does tend to require a heavier hand on the tiller.  Back when he used to play frequently (back east 30 years ago) he played a whole session of Elrond in bed hovering near death from a (near) mortal wound sustained by Black Commando when the survivors of the massacre of Tharbad were taken to Imladris to heal in safety.  He didn't have anything planned and the players were free to do as they wished.  A much lower intensity game of pure character play. Back then they played several times a week but only for about 4 hours at a time so the GM could mix it up.  Much harder today given how rarely we play.<br/><br/>I suppose that I should say that character development does exist but it moves at much slower pace.  As far as creating storylines we as players do not scene frame.  We can and do put plans into play and they too take a number of scenarios to develop and come to fruition.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                         </div>

                            Jay,<br/><br/>Keep in mind I'm just operating with guesswork here; if I am wrong, that wouldn't be a huge shock!<br/><br/>In that brief quote, I am talking about the larger "architecture" of play, which makes a frame for the stories being told (but it doesn't mean that the characters can't make interesting and meaningful choices within it).<br/><br/>My sense from what I know of your game is that it is the GM who frames new situations and storylines: "Let's find out what's happening on this island. You two can play two young boys, and you will be an old hermit living on the mountain. Here's what their situations are like, in brief..."<br/><br/>The other end of the spectrum would be a player saying, "Ok, the next session is going to focus on a war in Near Harad. I know we haven't seen anything in that part of the world yet, but I think there is a violent conflict brewing there. I'm going to be playing the leader of a rebellion [which I just made up] near a long-lost city. We are opposed by a new cult worshipping some twisted old legends..."<br/><br/>In other words, to use your Die Hard analogy, the GM is responsible for "the terrorists have taken over the building, and you're stuck in the middle of it. The phones aren't working". The player is responsible for, "I am John McClane. What am I going to make of that situation?"<br/><br/>Is that close?<br/><br/>One part I'm not sure about:<br/><br/>In the Star Wars game I'm referring to, the GM largely decided the "You are John McClane" part, although the players had lots of freedom to create the character as they wished (assigning stats, skills, personality, and so forth, on top of the basic character concept - you could make your own, unique John McClane, in other words). I don't know how this falls out in your game, or how consistent it is (I wouldn't be surprised if it varied, from storyline to storyline, either).<br/><br/>I'd love to hear more about how the multiple storylines and multiple characters for each player to play develop, who takes the lead on that, how many you end up with, and so forth. How does that whole aspect of play take shape? Who decides when new characters and storylines start and end, for instance, and how many character might you end up playing a) over the long term, or b) at any given time (let's say, within a handful of sessions)?                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>,<br/><br/>Forgot to address this part - 
<blockquote>However, that game also used a fair bit of D&amp;D-style "PC glow" to function. (What I mean by the expression "PC glow" is that the players all reacted to characters differently depending on whether they were PCs or NPCs. So, for example, when I joined I (and another player who just joined) took on the roles of two thieves/burglars who had broken into the other PCs' demesne and were caught red-handed. However, now that those burglars were recreated as PCs, we were let out of our cells and invited to participate in their adventures, instead (something they would presumably never have done if the burglars had remained NPCs). This worked well in that particular game, but I can also imagine it being very jarring in other games or for other gamers.</blockquote>
I would agree that there is a fair amount of "PC glow" in our game.  Most of the players (myself included) are loath to kill another player's character.  That being said if a PC is obviously a problem or a "bad guy" they frequently would not be accepted into the group unless there was some extremely compelling in game reason for them to be allowed in.  FREX - I've played a Ranger of Ithilien and have arrested PC's in the past as have other players.  Not long ago I was playing a nascent cleric who for complex reasons was travelling with a group that contained a "magic user".  The magic user was not Istari or any other special race, just a mortal man.  My "intuition" was telling me that whatever he was doing the source of magic (which had alway been forbidden to mortal men - remember what happened to the Witch King?) it was not coming from a good source so I rode this guy hard.  Another time I was playing a bad man in charge of a small town where strange events started to occur.  I called a meeting of the three other men involved to figure out what was going on and plot a course of action.  A PC took the opportunity to listen as the door and rolled a '1'.  He was discovered.  I kicked the living sh*t out of his character and was going to kill him when an emergency arose that demanded my immediate attention.<br/><br/>Yes, there is "PC glow" but only if we can find a way to justify it.  Another concern is that sundering a given night's group really slows the game down.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

Extraordinarily rarely.  On the rare occasion that such a combat happens the difference in the combat is the GM pulls the players' "hero's saving throw."  Like so much else in the game individual player skill is the predominant factor followed by relative weapon skills/character level.<br/><br/>Hi <a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">@ValyrianSteelKatana</a>,
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">@Silmenume</a>, I do have a question (forgive me if this has been answered, this thread is quite lengthy!). Does the game have any rigidly-defined subsystems that are used? Think like D&amp;D's combat: roll initiative, then you can move up to your speed and perform one action plus one bonus action (and those actions are Attack, Dash, Shove, etc.).<br/><br/>If so, would you mind detailing them? If not, how do you handle conflict resolution in a way that leaves the players satisfied?</p></div></blockquote>
Hi <a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">@ValyrianSteelKatana</a>,<br/><br/>Like most things in the game how and what we can do is pretty much left up to the actual player's player skill as seasoned by secondary skills and their values.  Using your example of combat it happens in "real time."  There are no initiative rolls, no table grid map with movement allowances, fixed number of actions per turn/segment or what have you.  <br/><br/>That being said there is some "crunch" to the mechanics as to if you hit and when you are hit.  The things that matter and are called into play are weapon plusses (these are numbers that are added to your D20 roll), Armor Class, Armor, Stamina, PBP (Personal Body Points - these represent your physical body and typically come into play when you run out of Stamina).  But what you do and how you go about doing it is pretty much up the actual player's abilities.  If an orc is charing you and you freeze up you're going to die.  Now the DM slows the "clock" down for new players giving them time to think but the old players have to think and act on our feet.  We have a few other modifiers like called shots which carry heavy penalties but have powerful effects and directional modifiers.  Attacking from behind gets you hefty bonuses which decrease as you move around the clock until you are facing the person in which there are no modifiers.  Finally there are smotes, full smotes, thrusts, and full thrusts which substantially add to damage but leave you out of position and with an increased vulnerability to a counter attack should one be forthcoming.<br/><br/>For all the above I would say that our mechanics during combat are primarily bookkeeping ones and what we can or cannot do is primarily limited to our speed of thought, our imaginations and what is plausible given the circumstances.  There are no "rigidly-defined subsytems" other than if damage rolled against you surpasses your stamina it goes into PBP.  If a body part's PBP goes to zero is no longer functions.  If it goes to zero you start bleeding out and if gets to a negative value the opposite of the positive value you roll your hero's saving throw and if you fail that you are dead. FREX you have 7 PBP in your arm and it gets to -7 you've bled out.<br/><br/>I don't know if I've helped or confused the issue.  If you have more questions please feel free to ask more questions!<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Hey Paul,<br/><br/>As "real time" as possible.  During combat the only number the players have to compute is adding their weapons plusses to the D20 role.  I should note that much of our combat is mimed between the player and the DM with any additional emphasis spoken by the player as both are trading swings.  If a player makes a move that catches the GM off guard he'll call for a die roll.  If it's a hit we roll damage and percentile for location.  When this happens we do our level best to expedite the search and handling time so we can get back to the fun stuff.  Usually this is a matter of a handful of seconds.<br/><br/>Conversely when the GM says we take a hit he'll say something like, "You take 30 stamina."  We note the loss on our sheet and move on.  Again its just a few seconds before we get back to the fury of combat.<br/><br/>For myself when I know I'm heading into combat I'll write my weapon pluses, damage die and stamina on a separate sheet of paper so I can easily keep track of my numbers.<br/><br/>If we do get into PBP damage area (our stamina has gone to zero) it's good that we slow down for a moment as we search for the PBP values on our sheet as we are getting perilously close to death.<br/><br/>Sometimes the extra pause that comes from trying the calculate 1.5 damage from dealing a full smote can add extra drama to the moment!  Just as in most of the play a natural '20' is exploding so though the combat has technically paused the drama of dice adds significantly to the moment.<br/><br/>On the whole we spend vastly more time in the act of combat than we do in search and handling.  Again we have to respond in "real time" to what the GM is doing or he automatically hits as if our character was standing there mouth gaping.  If the GM swings we don't have minutes or even seconds to determine our response.  It has to be immediate.  And you know what?  It's absolutely exhilarating!  While all this is going on the GM is cross cutting like a movie from combat to combat so not only do we need to keep track of our own condition we have to keep track of the overall battle. <br/><br/>Does that make any sense?<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

You have the right of it.
<blockquote>Personally, I'm fascinated by all this, and I wish I could witness a session in action to fully comprehend it.</blockquote>
Our hiatus should be coming to an end in a few weeks.  I'll try and get permission to record at least a portion of combat.  No promises.  If I could record myself in combat I'd be happy to do so and share.<br/><br/>Hey Paul,

I've mentioned in earlier posts that combat by necessity of the SJ process and the human condition is more crunchy than the rest of play.  However, just because it is more crunchy does not mean that combat is not "spicy".  What one does and says still has a powerful influence on outcomes.  Hard target numbers are used extremely rarely and when used are more of a means to "communicate" in a shorthand just how difficult something is to accomplish rather than to actually set a number that is a pass/fail value.  A die roll by a play that could <i>reasonably</i> be "interpreted" as a miss can succeed if the idea catches the GM off guard or is just to clever not to be allowed some level of "success".  Conversely what might be reasonably interpreted as likely to succeed can "fail" due to other factors like playing an overhead swing and forgetting they are in a densely wooded area striking a branch.<br/><br/>Again, while combat is far and away the crunchiest part of the game, it is still very "spicey."<br/><br/>The only other area that might be considered "crunchy" might be the spell casting system, but again that's mostly a matter of book keeping.  However, I've both read the notes on the how the magic system is supposed to work and seen it in play and it too is veeeeery "spicey" in practice.  This works in our game because in ME as opposed to, say, "The Dresden Files," as magic is less an exercise in engineering and well, rather, magical!<br/><br/>I'm not very sure what is meant by your question re: "skill checks".  Are you asking do we use them?  Are you asking how they function mechanically?  In practice our GM very rarely calls for a specific "skill check."  There are several reasons for this.  First his memory is freakishly amazing.  He remembers more about our characters numbers than we do.  Many, many times he's called out a skill value on our sheet and been spot on.  Bear in mind that we all have many characters, there are many skills on a sheet and a fair number of players at the table.  When he's off its rarely by more than +/- 1 level.  So when we're told to roll he already knows the skill value for each player.  Another reason is that our game is an experiential process with him feeding us perceptual information and leaving it up to us to figure out what he's giving us.  This forces us to really pay attention to everything that is happening to everyone and to listen very intently to what he is saying.  If he specifically calls for a tracking check and the player rolls poorly we now have an objective fact rather than an experiential interpretable event.  Finally there are certain skills such as intuition, perception or events like surprise that don't work emotionally if you know you're rolling for them.<br/><br/>On occasion where it would make for the greatest dramatic impact he may call for a specific skill check where rolling hi/low would a strong moment of frisson.  Near as I can tell, and I'll have to check with the GM, practically speaking skill checks can be used to limit PC effectiveness if the player is narrating attempting skills that only a much high leveled/skilled character would have.  We all try to play at our limits but sometimes we forget in the heat of the moment that we are playing our 3rd level Ranger in training and not our 13th level Dunedain.  I also suspect secondary skills and skills checks are used to help differentiate characters functionally within a group.  There are a good number of skills that are common to all characters and there are those unique or unusual skills we create when we roll up a new character that helps color and differentiate the PC.  FREX chess, card sharp, whistling, court etiquette, etc.<br/><br/>Far more common is the player who'll "call" for a specific skill check.  Let's say we have a group travelling through a forest tracking the MacGuffin and lose the track.  Let us further say that one of the player's is an Elf who has Animal Empathy.  The player indicates to the GM that he stops, closes his eyes and tips his head as if listening intently.  The player might say, "Cary, I stop and open up my heart.  Do I sense any grouping of animals in any particular direction that are agitated or upset in some way?"  The player is cueing the GM that he wants to make an animal empathy check.  We don't know the target number because a die roll may indicate a fail of the character to employ the skill effectively or it may be that there is nothing <i>to</i> detect.  However the higher the skill level is the smaller the chance of a false positive/negative or an incorrect interpretation.<br/><br/>I know I've been a bit vague but secondary skills and the perception/subjective nature of our game are intimately tied.  It's very close to asking exactly how do we actually play and as you know that is a very complicated topic.  I hope I've at least shed a little light.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

I'll have to ponder all this... it's still not easy to imagine without some kind of example.<br/><br/>In the meantime, what about "marking skill checks" on your character sheets? What's that for? Is it a number that's added to a particular d20 roll when applicable? How and why do you accrue these? Is it GM whim, or can you do things as a player to accrue them or decide when and where they accrued, or some combination?                        </div>

                            Hey Paul,<br/><br/>I know I was a bit vague but in the second to last paragraph I did give a very specific example of a situation and a piece of dialogue of how a skill check could be called for.  I must be not understanding what you are actually looking for from me.  Would be so kind as to clarify further how my example was not what you were truly looking for?  It would help me tremendously!<br/><br/><i>In the meantime, what about "marking skill checks" on your character sheets? What's that for?</i><br/><br/>Many skills are listed on a generic character sheet.  Most every character will have some facility in theses skills.  This facility is represented by a number.  These skills values are used in two different ways.  The first way is fuel for the imagination.  These values help us imagine and/or recall who and what our character is and can do.  They also represent a kind of record of what a character has done and to what degree.  FREX - if a character has a high value in dungeon lore that means that character has not only spent a significant amount of time underground but has survived that time.  It's a very rare skill and rarer still is a high value in it.<br/><br/>The second manner a skill value is used much more directly impacts play and does have a mechanical component - though still "spicey".  The skill value is added to the die roll and any situational modifiers are added/subtracted and if the value is above a 20 some sort of success is noted.  However as nearly all skill checks are FitB we don't know what skill is being rolled against, if a skill is even being checked in the first place.  As you indicated earlier you noted just how frequently we roll during a sessions.  I would estimate the vast majority of those rolls are "fate steering" rolls.  IOW the DM is using to roll to determine if the current situation will move in a positive or negative direction.  Maybe he's fishing for a '1' or a '20'.  Maybe he's having us roll just to keep the tension high.  But if a die roll is a straight up skill check then its d20 roll plus skill level plus/minus situational modifiers with a 20 total need for a "success".  As crunchy as this might seem remember this is still SJ and all successes/failures are open to DM interpretation and player perception.<br/><br/>Now onto "marking skill checks."<br/><br/>The general rule of thumb in our game is the more one uses a skill the better one gets at said skill.  The awarding of checks to a skill reflects this increase in ability.  There are several circumstances that typically result in skill checks being handed out.  Rolling "20's", "10's" and sometimes a "1" outside of combat represents the greatest opportunity to getting a skill "check."  Sometimes during play the GM will hand wave a lengthy period of travel and will hand out skill checks to reflect the usage of applicable skills over that period of time.  Sometimes he'll go through each appropriate skill and give out specific numbers of checks other times he might say, "Everyone roll 3d4, no more than 2 checks in any given outdoor skill" and we apply them as we see fit within his constraints.  Sometimes a player employs a skill in such a unique and intelligent fashion that the GM will just hand out checks as a reward for clever thinking.  Finally a PC can try and learn about a skill from another more skilled character (PC/NPC).  This is fairly rare and to be honest I'm not entirely sure how this last method is sorted out but I do know that the relative skills values are important and die rolling (D20's) on the part of both parties is involved.  Does this last paragraph touch directly on your question and did it help at all?<br/><br/>A player who has since passed had a pretty good take on what all the values on our character sheets <i>really</i> meant - they represented the currency by which we purchased our fantasies.  They were the tangible things by which we constructed the mental imagery and informed the creation of the character we were playing.  Numbers aren't destiny but they do fuel the imagination.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

Remember that a player can roll a '10' failing the skill check while still possibly gaining a check in said skill.  So rolling a '10' and a '20' are not the same as two different conditions are being examined at the same time.<br/><br/>Did you gain any insight regarding the skill from the attempt at using the skill?<br/>Did you employ your skill successfully and learn something about the situation?
<blockquote>I picture this : "check a skill when you fail by 1 : you see what you can improve". Everybody now wants to fail by one...</blockquote>
As described above there are a variety of different circumstances where a player can get a check to apply to a skill.  However, given that we play a game based on subjective perception as described by the GM, we rarely know what skill we are actually rolling against and even less frequently do we know the "target number".  Did we fail our climb roll or did the branch break?<br/><br/>When the GM has us roll a D20 and it happens to be a skill check one does not want to fail as that can lead to all kinds of Very Bad Things happening.  And bad things happening to the PC's <i>usually</i> means bad things happening for the world in some lesser or greater fashion.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                          </div>

When we haven't played in a long while, there's a new player or he playing a "big" scenario he'll spend a couple of hours mulling things over, but not in the way you've described.  He does not create plots, NPC scripts, scenes prior to play.  What he does spend time considering is which PC's are going to be in the scenario, generating motivations for why they would be bound to the scenario (many times a game is the first time that the PCs are coming into contact with each other) what the "bad guys" are attempting to accomplish (their goal), who the "bad guys" are, what means the "bad guys" have at their disposal, names for NPCs and their motivations, where the scenario is taking place in ME, other encounters than might be bumped into (be they geographic or "monsters" or a magical item, etc.)  He might guess at where the story might go but he <i>does not plan out where the nights event will/must go</i>.<br/><br/>Other times, especially when we've been playing regularly, he'll just ask what characters we want to play at the table and go right from there.<br/><br/>I hope that was useful.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Ah! Interesting. I feel like I could have given the same answer Jay provided about the skill checks to DeReel; this means I'm starting to get a good handle on this game! (Even though there are still so many surprises!)<br/><br/>(Jay, my earlier questions were about "marking skill checks", which you have now answered in great detail. Perfect! Thank you.)<br/><br/>I have another question:<br/><br/>In the session you and I have discussed elsewhere, one of the characters levels up and reaches 10th level.<br/><br/>I have a lot of questions about that!<br/><br/>* Why did he level up (I can't see anything nice particular happening in those circumstances, so what "triggered" it)?<br/><br/>* How often do characters "level up", generally speaking, and what does that entail in terms of the game mechanics?<br/><br/>* Does levelling up (and having levels, in general) carry specific connotations in the fictional reality, as well?

Are there certain positions in the gameworld a character couldn't hold without achieving a certain level, for instance?<br/><br/>* There is a hearty round of "congratulations" when this happens. What is being celebrated? Is leveling up to 10th level (specifically) particularly notable, or just levelling up at all? Is it a question of time spent playing, certain player decisions, or something that it's possible to fail at, making success a rare thing (if, for instance, characters die regularly enough, achieving a high level could be a very rare accomplishment, even if it would be otherwise more or less guaranteed).                        </div>

                            Hi Paul,
<blockquote>* Why did he level up (I can't see anything nice particular happening in those circumstances, so what "triggered" it)?</blockquote>
Leveling up is both a "simple" mechanical process tied in with a complex "subjective" process.  Mechanically leveling occurs when a number of experience points is exceeded.  Most XP is gained from combat.  This character had rocketed up multiples levels on several occasions and was 1xp short of 10th level for quite a while.  However to both prevent Gamist play and to encourage and reward play beyond just being murder hobos a player also needs "wisdom checks" to go up levels.  The rate is 10 times the level you're going to, i.e., you need 50 wisdom checks to get to 5th providing you have the XP.  Finally there are occasions when players do amazing things where they gain enough experience and wisdom checks to rocket up levels very quickly.  So the GM institutes a kind of period of "reflection" for the PC who has experienced so much so quickly to process everything that has happened.  (In short a player needs XP, wisdom checks and <i>time</i> to go up level[s].  Normally this happens slowly enough that the processing period is not needed). This was not the case with Dax's character.<br/><br/>In this game the DM felt that the time was right and declared Dax's character as part of the night's celebration.
<blockquote>* How often do characters "level up", generally speaking, and what does that entail in terms of the game mechanics?</blockquote>
Lower level characters level up faster than higher level characters - if they survive.  How often is a really difficult question as we don't play the same characters from session to session and we play so irregularly.  If a player is hot and the scenario is hot a low level character can earn enough XP to raise up to 4 levels in a night (very rare but it can happen - e.g. Dax's character) where as high level character can take years to go up a single level.<br/><br/>The actual roll up is a fairly quick process.  Stamina is rolled as is Armor Class.  The next thing rolled is "natural attack" and finally any appropriate weapon skills are rolled.  "Natural Attack" is a reflection of an idea that a character that has been through a lot of combat is going to have a general combat ability no matter what weapon or circumstance.  This is the foundation of all weapon skills.  Individual weapons are then rolled depending on how much you used them and that roll up is added to the Natural Attack to come to a final composite value.  This value determines your plus to hit with your weapon.
<blockquote>* Does levelling up (and having levels, in general) carry specific connotations in the fictional reality, as well?

Are there certain positions in the gameworld a character couldn't hold without achieving a certain level, for instance?</blockquote>
Reaching 10th is a difficult achievement given the lethality of the world as well as the time invested in getting there.  In this case this was the player's first 10th level character.  It is milestone at the social contract level that we feel truly marks a player as having "made it".  Congratulation is in order!  A job well done as it is no easy task.<br/><br/>In game its bit more nebulous.  <i>Around</i> 10th level a PC starts to come to the attention to the powers of the world.  For better or worse.  It's not a strict correlation but around this level (give or take) such PC starts to become involved in the councils of wise and becoming instrumental in the decisions that can influence the direction of the world.  Such a character moves from just reacting to becoming proactive in the politics and the decision making of the world.  You start entering into the councils of Gandalf, Elrond, Aragorn, the Steward, etc.  You start to become a captain whose decisions and actions start to have far reaching consequences.  Etc, etc, etc.<br/><br/>Did I touch on everything?  Let me know if you have further questions.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Wow, very interesting! (And I'm somewhat surprised that combat is the source of most XP in such a Middle Earth-centric game.

The timing is entirely opaque to me. Is Cary simply distracted by this thought all of a sudden (to me, it seems like he is in the middle of narration when he makes the announcement), or is something happening in the fiction of the game linked to the character leveling up? What happened to "trigger" the leveling up, in other words? Why did Cary say it at that particular moment?<br/><br/>(Thanks for all the thorough and thoughtful answers lately. A lot of the puzzle pieces are starting to slot into place!)                        </div>

<blockquote>what is it in that particular session/moment/scene that leads to the character leveling up? The timing is entirely opaque to me</blockquote>
A few days to actually playing Cary had told me that he was going to "give" Dax his 10th level.<br/><br/>Why he chose that particular moment in the game to announce it, I don't have a clue.  That Dax had achieved the level Cary had determined outside and prior to the session.  The announcement was a formality executed before all the players so that everyone knew of his achievement.  At some point in the future he and Dax will actually roll up the numbers as I had described in an earlier post.<br/><br/>The determination of a player's level (The calculation of XP's, the checking of the wisdom checks, etc.) is always determined out of game.  Game time is always far too precious to spend on bookkeeping and the like.  Don't get me wrong, we like our levels and the increased survivability that comes from them, but what's the point of leveling if we aren't playing?
<blockquote>And I'm somewhat surprised that combat is the source of most XP in such a Middle Earth-centric game.  Is this just a carryover from D&amp;D - or whatever game system this is based on - or does it have some deeper rationale?</blockquote>
It's a combination of a holdover from D&amp;D and from a scene from the Hobbit.  In the Hobbit when the Dwarves had been captured by the Spiders in the Mirkwood, Bilbo kills a spider at some point.  There is a description in the sequence somewhere that talks about a change that comes over Bilbo.  A type of personal growth.  So it's a combination of both.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>
