So I've been to Dreamation a couple of times now and just attended GPNW.  From what I can tell of Jiffy Con, Nerdly, Go Play Beach Party et.al. the same is probably true of them.  What I've noticed is you have tables full of amazing story gamers coming together with the expectation of having great fun with each other at one of the few times many of them get to get together to play.  And invariably...they do.  They do have great play, and they write about what great play they had in AP reports.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I got to wondering...given those rarified circumstances...wouldn't they have had great play, playing...pretty much anything.  I mean these are some of the most incredible improvisational roleplayers on the planet.  You could pretty much give them the crappiest set of rules ever written and as long as they can come up with a compelling initial situation they'll find a way to have a fun time...because that's what they're there to do.  They know how to make characters interesting.  They know how to recognize compelling conflicts.  They know how to engage in dramatic and interesting dialog.  They're going to do that regardless...cuz that's what they do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here comes a designer with a new game design.  And its the new hotness.  And its getting some play at these story games cons.  And the AP reports are fantastic good fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here's the discussion I've been having with myself in my head that I now wish to have with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre those experiences really valid data points for the designer to use when judging how solid their design is?  Does the specific situation of con play where people are interested in having fun playing with people they don't normally get to play with automatically disqualify the session from being a real "play test".  In other words, are those sessions too much "play" and not enough "test" to count?  How easy is it to distinguish when the talent around the table is making the play work inspite of the rules instead of because of them?  When you're just playing to maximize fun with your friends are you self aware enough to recognize when you're actually using the rules and when you're just making it work because having fun improv roleplaying is what you do?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo what extent then do amazing AP reports from such conventions have to be taken with a grain of salt because they are not representational of typical play circumstances?<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219980/#Comment_219980" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T18:52:12+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  6:52PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, as one who has played in many a truly horrible game at a con, I can say that the quality of the players does of course matter.<br><br>Still, the system is a huge factor as well- although you can have fun even with a crappy system if you're good, presumably you would have had more fun if you'd have been playing a more interesting game. <br><br>I'd say that any AP report isn't exactly an objective experience, so you should perhaps take them all with a grain of salt.

Because Yo-Yo Ma knows what makes a good cello: he has the experience and he has the talent to make an honest, expert appraisal of the instrument's worth.  If he plays it and says it's good, that means something.<br><br>So if you're a game designer and you hand your baby over to people you think are great players, and they come back and say "Yes, this was a really good game," you should be pleased.  Because I promise you, if they've got the talent and the experience, they'll know what's making the game more fun and what's working against the fun.  If your rules suck, they will tell you (assuming they're giving you a playtest report and not just being nice 'cause they don't want to say mean things on the internet), and then they will tell you what they did to have fun DESPITE your suck-ass rules.  And you can use that information to repair your mistakes and incorporate any useful feedback they gave you.<br/><br/><br/>The flip side to this is that games are more a matter of taste than a cello is.  A game which is roundly loved by your story games cognoscenti may be a total flop when played by every other gaming group on the planet.  Getting your game played by as many different groups as possible under as many different conditions as possible will give you more useful information than just reading the Big Story Games Hootenanny Actual Play report.  Maybe you don't want to make the game that appeals only to them: maybe you want to put in rules they think are unnecessary, but which other gamers in other places will find invaluable.  It's up to you how much you want to cater to their specific tastes: you may discount or ignore their opinion whenever it fails to match up to whatever audience you DO want to cultivate, and feel just fine about it.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219991/#Comment_219991" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T19:51:14+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  7:51PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, those terrific improvisational roleplayers are two important things to me.

But often these games don\u2019t get written up as APs. I\u2019ve walked out on a few games. <br/><br/>Sometimes a game\u2019s concept and core system are good but those involved hack out rules intentionally and often unintentionally. This happens with PTA quite a bit. So the game has something to it but it may not be clear what.<br/><br/>Sometimes a con isn\u2019t the best environment for the game at all and hacking or streamlining is needed to make it fit into the time slot. This used to be the case with Burning Wheel. The con experience and the at home experience were very different. <br/><br/>I know as a player I have stealth-GMed to save a game. Meaning there were games going bad that I used my PC as a tool to subtly co-GM to up the fun factor without anyone knowing. For all I know people have done that to me in other games! <br/><br/>The converse can be true. Sometimes storygame baggage can make a good game go wrong. You saw this with In a Wicked Age early on. In those AP reports, was the game really bad or was something else going on?<br/><br/>To complicate things further, often people know they had a good time but don\u2019t know why. The AP report might accurately communicate enjoyment that can be attributed to a system but not the specific reason for it. <br/><br/>Luke likes to watch his games playtested without participating. That way he can make observations based on how people react in game rather than their interpretations after the fact. For example, I\u2019ve seen people have a horrible time 75% of a game but the last 25% was so awesome they forgot the first part. And vice versa. <br/><br/>I think APs are useful. I wouldn\u2019t look to them for actual research into the details of the matter. But they can be a useful barometer for general enthusiasm. The fact that someone bothered to write an AP, good or bad, is a sign worth exploring.  Ultimately, I would look to patterns in a series of APs rather than focus on just one or two. It\u2019s like how I read the news. I\u2019ll read the same news reported from different perspectives to see what patterns and contradictions shine through.<br/><br/>I think what APs are very bad at is communication the value of a game\u2019s text. Often many of us playing haven\u2019t read the rules and are riffing off of someone else\u2019s interpretations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220010/#Comment_220010" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T23:08:34+00:00" title="July 21, 2009 11:08PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, first of all, even if a game was only good at cons, and was horrible elsewhere, for whatever reason, that doesn't make it a bad game, it just means it's a good con game and a bad elsewhere game.

I trust great gamers to be more objective analyzing a game far more than I would run-of-the-mill hacks. Half the fun of going to conventions is talking shop with smart people who spend their free time thinking about such things.<br/><br/>On the other hand, at JiffyCon, I played a game that, I am told, has been very popular at conventions that, frankly, made no sense to me. The game provided a great character in a seriously messed up situation, and the convention provided great gamers to play off, but what I was supposed to do with the fiddly bits, I never did sort out.

If that guy is really good, and the players are really good, then the experience will be really good, even if the game is seriously flawed.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote, "flawed", not "completely broken".

My only other notable con experiences where I played a game there then brought it home and played it some more was 3:16.. And 3:16 simply delivers on what it promised, to me.

This can have a strong effect on the experience. Firstly it's often the case that the players haven't even read the book because the creator is telling them how to play and instilling in them his own sense of enthusiasm for the product, which can be infectious under the right circumstances. This means that you can't be certain the text of the book is clear, concise, and lively enough to enthuse the reader with the game. For a proper, proper test you have to give the book to someone who's never played the game and see how they get on running it. Annoyingly this is one of the hardest things to persuade playtesters to do.<br/><br/>Conventions do tend to get some people excited too, and under such conditions they may be more easily pleased than they would be normally.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220031/#Comment_220031" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T03:33:26+00:00" title="July 22, 2009  3:33AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the other hand will those expert players have experience from many other games.

Unfortunately, sometimes these sessions end up promoting a flawed game.  <br/><br/>The one game I haven't really talked about from GPNW that I participated in was a playtest that was sort of lukewarm, so at least judging by my own behavior the awesome count may be inflated if you take AP as representative of overall experience.<br/><br/>Design goals may come into play here, too - again from my own experience, in the past it has been my friends and people like them that I've been writing for, so that carries with it certain expectations about engagement, skill, and approach that may not map one to one with every gamer everywhere.  At cons it is self-selecting, for the most part, so the experience these games produce at cons is generally accurate.  I'm not taking this approach any more, so for current and future projects it probably won't be accurate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220042/#Comment_220042" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T05:22:24+00:00" title="July 22, 2009  5:22AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Judd on this one.

If a game can't work with great players and the game designer running the game that certainly says something as well but if a game does work there it doesn't tell you much. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou get a lot better feedback when you stress test a game. A Gen Con run with the game designer running the game shows a game can stand up to a general audience (keeping in mind that Gen Con RPGers tend to be quite good so it's still a special audience). A beta test at Gen Con where the designer passes on the game to someone else tells you a whole lot more. I've certainly learned from my Matrix Game demo referees over the years and modified my rules when I saw them spontaneously come up with great ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen an interested person who you've never met runs your game and it comes out well that's golden and the full jack pot is of course when an average gamer picks your game up in a store and has amazing play. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo my impression is that elite game play tells you very little but it is a nice tidal pool to grow in when a system is very young. The AP reports that are generated that way are more word of mouth marketing than play tests. <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel good when I read stuff on line about my games where people who I've never met write about my games explaining things the way I explained them because it shows me the idea worked and is now out there propagating itself.

When people attend a playtest at a con, I tend to see that it's advertised as a playtest, so they are interested in trying something new out and are very forgiving. People want to have a good time in your game, especially at a con where their time is limited . Those aren't traits that you will necessarily be able to count on from the buying public. But it's not useless, it just tells you different things from hands-off playtesting, or blind playtesting, or a playtest that lasts many sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220096/#Comment_220096" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T09:55:08+00:00" title="July 22, 2009  9:55AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2009 9:56AM by Brendan.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was about to make sort of the same point, Robert:<br><br/>1) System matters.<br/>2) The system is defined as the means by which the group agrees to imagined events during play.<br/><br/>The first is to say that one can't discount the effects of a game's rules on the outcome of <i>any</i> play session; the second is to say that the game's text is never identical to the game being played.  Even when run by its creator, and especially when played by people who haven't read that text.  We all have that much down, right?<br/><br/>It's hard to answer both Ralph's original question ("to what extent does AP have to be taken with a grain of salt") and Graham's clarification ("should a designer trust con play for playtests") because they're both asking for answers on an undefined scale and all the evidence at hand is anecdotal.  I've personally had mostly amazing sessions at good cons.  I've also played a couple con games, with awesome fellow players, run by their designers, whose other games I like...  and had no fun whatsoever.  The nice thing about that is that I know the problem isn't with the social dynamic or the atmosphere or player skill level:  the blame lies squarely on the system.  That's valuable.  And therefore, the good games are valuable data too.<br/><br/>One thing:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>When you're just playing to maximize fun with your friends are you self aware enough to recognize when you're actually using the rules and when you're just making it work because having fun improv roleplaying is what you do?</blockquote>\nEven in specific playtest-focused mode, <i>you should never not be playing to maximize fun with your friends.</i>  Games that do not have this as their chief objective will always fail, and that makes their data useless.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220098/#Comment_220098" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T09:59:14+00:00" title="July 22, 2009  9:59AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9902&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">I started this thread</a> to further discuss writing out key Lumpley Principle stuff, as to not muddy this thread further.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220102/#Comment_220102" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T10:11:29+00:00" title="July 22, 2009 10:11AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Several things:<br/><br/>Should you trust con reports for playtests (I know it's not the question meant, but bear with me). I'll take Accounting for Taste's reply and take it one step further. The AP is a story constructed after the fact*. Don't trust that to serve as playtest feedback, because that's not what it's there to do.<br/>But if those people also give you feedback, as in playtest feedback, trust them. Skilled players can make a meh game work (sometimes), and still know what makes it meh, and apparently, also how to make it better (for them, at least).<br/><br/>As for the real question? That's something I call "Blinders"*. The solution is simple. Have it played at GenCon in one of those random slots, have it played in GPNW by those "awesome players", have people who don't go to cons test it. If all your tests involve the same category of players, and/or they are all in the same sort of setting, then the results will be skewed.<br/>Could they be trusted? Yes. For that arena.<br/><br/>Only getting reports from awesome players at cons? Then think of it as applicable only for awesome players at cons.<br/>The "At cons" part matters, because great players who get a meh game at home are likely to just pick up something better, even if they could fix it, why bother when they can get something they don't need to fix? At the con, their time is spent, and the con experience is part of it.<br/><br/>* Imagine a link here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220111/#Comment_220111" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T10:31:51+00:00" title="July 22, 2009 10:31AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2009 12:43PM by Valamir.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I agree Brendan  Unless you're allowing for the "fun" to be had when you're sitting around trying to figure out why the game you're playing is so damn broken.<br/><br/>If your primary goal is "having fun" then most likely you're going to overlook flaws to keep things moving.  You're not going to dwell on the rough parts.  When you encounter a hole you're not going to let it derail the game, you're going to get past it as best as you can and keep playing so you can get to more fun bits. I think this is especially true when you're talking about improv heavy games being played by improv skilled people since its exceptionally easy to have fun just by enjoying the experience of improving with friends...and pretty easy to get completely off the reservation in the process.<br/><br/>When you're actually play testing you don't skip over the flaws...you intentionally seek them out.  You stress test it by doing exactly the sorts of things that aren't expected and see if the game survives.  You catalog what went wrong, when it went wrong and spend some time trying to figure out where the source of the problem was.  Sometimes it was you not playing right.  Sometimes that's due to assumptions you brought, other times sloppy text.  Much of the time its a situation the rules hadn't considered yet.  Usually, unless the game is pretty close to being done...the actual play part is NOT fun.  If it were, it wouldn't be so hard to find people willing to playtest.  The TEST part can be fun, if you like that sort of thing.  But its a different sort of fun...not the sort of fun that makes for entertaining AP reports.<br/><br/>Now I may be in a minority here, but I'm actually pretty suspicious of playtests that are fun.  For me there's a big difference between Play, and Play Test.  If a game is getting alot of Play and that's being treated like Play Tests...ehhh...I'm not really so sure that works.<br/><br/>Like I played Fiasco at Go Play NW.  It was a ton of fun, that game is really really close to being completely baked.  I don't know whether or not Jason considers that session to have been a "play test" but it definitely wasn't from my perspective.  We were playing...there was no testing going on...we were just playing.  When my group actually playtested Fiasco a few months ago...we play TESTED it.  We poked it, we prodded it, we intentionally tried to see if we could find weak spots either in the rules or in the text.  And I think the feed back we gave wound up being pretty helpful.  But if we'd just played...we could have made it work...but I don't think the feed back we'd have given would have been that helpful.  I don't in any way consider the hours spent play testing Fiasco to have been not worth it...but I also wouldn't call those hours...fun...not in the same way the session I played at GPNW was fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220114/#Comment_220114" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T10:35:50+00:00" title="July 22, 2009 10:35AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>And I think the feed back we gave wound up being pretty helpful.</blockquote>\nYeah, they were lowdown bitches about it and they basically saved the game with their feedback.

Personally, I'm looking forward to this game seeing print so I can score a copy. And I'm glad our feedback was that helpful.<br/><br/>But yeah, everything that Ralph says about playtesting is true. (Good thing we agree on it, given that we're in the same playtest group.) I would offer some nuance. I think that early playtests that are about proof of concept can be treated gently. But, at some point, you have to unleash my wife at the game; she's a fiend for finding the stress points in a game (mechanically, procedurally, or fictionally) and then exploiting them. It's really quite valuable for playtesting, but not fun like gameplay is fun.<br/><br/>This is why we separated out our playtest night from our regular gaming. Playtesting is work. Yes, it's work I enjoy, but it's still work.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220353/#Comment_220353" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T12:17:26+00:00" title="July 23, 2009 12:17PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2009 12:18PM by Brian_Minter.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>...the Big Story Games Hootenanny Actual Play report. </blockquote>\nSUBSCRIBE                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220357/#Comment_220357" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T12:22:39+00:00" title="July 23, 2009 12:22PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2009 12:30PM by Graham.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph, I do disagree with you on this, as I think you know.<br/><br/>If you're not playtesting with the intention of having fun, you're not performing a valid test, in my opinion.

That's not at all what the results of the road test said.  The report should have been "It's smooth, so long as you don't drive over that pothole there, that bump over here, and slow down a lot when you get to this part," since that's what the test revealed.  Going out of your way to have a smooth ride just can't happen by accident on a road with as many problems as that.<br><br>Really, that just doesn't sound like a very good road tester; apparently he's bright enough to spot and navigate around the rough patches, but not bright enough to notice that he's doing it?  Is he some kind of asphalt savant, possessed with mysterious and inexplicable senses to find the smoothest path but incapable of translating those revelations into our feeble mortal language?

Unfortunately one does what one has to; I <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9742&amp;page=1#Comment_216287" rel="nofollow">wrote my Spectre of the Beast report</a> because nobody was doing it for me (Mickey gave it a <a href="http://geekgirlsrule.wordpress.com/2009/07/01/geek-girls-rule-90-go-play-nw-recap/" rel="nofollow">very nice mention</a> on her blog, but not really a <i>report</i>). My "report" did start out on a simple "it was awesome!" note, but I've tried recently to move it to a more analytical approach. I will keep in mind the idea to have someone else report on playtest games; it's a good one. But generally I'm lucky to get purely <i>verbal</i> feedback.<br/><br/>The issue is very real, and a bit thorny. I definitely agree with some people that ONLY playtesting at cons is a mistake, but I don't think I've seen evidence of that actually happening much. Seems like a lot of folks here have a handle the right balance: playtest in all kinds of different groups and environments: cons, home, friend, strangers, experienced, newbies. Myself, I've playtested in my home with people I know, and a bit at cons when I got the chance. I've had very little blind playtest, and would like to get more. What I got was valuable.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Now I may be in a minority here, but I'm actually pretty suspicious of playtests that are fun.  For me there's a big difference between Play, and Play Test.  If a game is getting alot of Play and that's being treated like Play Tests...ehhh...I'm not really so sure that works.</blockquote>\nHuh. That strikes me as an odd distinction to make. Maybe I've just been lucky, but when I've playtested my (admittedly, first and only) game, I've always had fun. I've always approached a playtest with the purpose of getting at the fun of <i>play</i>--otherwise what would a playtest tell you? I aim toward finding weak spots, but I do that by <i>playing</i>, and in the course of <i>that</i> trying out all the play components, pushing the break points, watching for the awkward or unfun, etc. I check the text by paying extra attention to what's written down there, verbally making sure we go through all the steps, and so forth. Informal stuff that works well or streamlines play finds its way into the text; that's what happened with the revised ashcan of Spectre. And I seek input from the players on all that. But it's still Play, approached as Play, with the aim of Fun.<br/><br/>Maybe it helps that my design is fairly simple with few moving parts. But when I someone admonish that we all remember that "Playtesting's work, not fun," it sets off all kinds of bells. It's true in a sense, but at the same time. . .ech. It's exactly the "fun" that I'm testing for!<br/><br/>peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220434/#Comment_220434" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T16:43:11+00:00" title="July 23, 2009  4:43PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As long as we're tossing anecdotes into the bonfire, I've had the experience of reading an amazing Actual Play writeup, picking up the finished Indie game, and finding this huge gap between the game described in the writeup and the game in my hands.

Ralph's road tester analogy is <i>exactly what you should do</i> in terms of how to test. The report was ass, obviously.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut note that pothole, and go around it. Note that lump of asphalt, and go around it. Note the grading scrape, and go slowly over it. Make sure you note HOW you went around or over all the rough spots. It's not your job to say "Dude, you need to fill that pothole, scrap down that lump, and smooth out the grade." It's your job to say "These are the problems I noted, and what I had to do to keep playing." The very worst thing you can do* is hit that damned pothole, go back and tell the road maker that his road is borked. You have failed to test the majority of his road at that point. You've pointed out one problem and quit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's the road maker's job to decide what to do about the pothole, lump and scrape. Maybe he'll just put signs up and say "go around this pothole" and "go slowly across this scrape". It may not be the best choice (obviously) but that's his choice. If all of the drivers follow the instructions and have a smooth ride, then that's what really counts. If the drivers see it for a half-ass fix, and don't like it, then the drivers will let him know that they don't approve of his choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n* Okay, obviously the worst thing you can do is not test it and say you did, or test it and give a false report.

Assuming you want to know if it works outside of cons, well then, you should test it outside of cons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220850/#Comment_220850" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-26T21:59:56+00:00" title="July 26, 2009  9:59PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think playtesting at GPNW and similar can be very valuable.  As Ralph points out, you're going to be knocking heads with the some of the best story gamers out there.  <br><br>But make sure people know that, or they won't playtest; they'll just play.  For example: I didn't playtest Fiasco at GPNW.  I played Jason's work-in-progress.
