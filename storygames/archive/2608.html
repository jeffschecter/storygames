I don't have any really specific things to tackle at the moment; I'm just trying to get at some kind of general principles of game design.<br/><br/>What games have done combat (conflicts) particularly well or badly?<br/><br/>How do you incorporate player input/creativity into combat actions in interesting ways?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59933/#Comment_59933" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T11:36:15+00:00" title="March  8, 2007 11:36AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The big question is.. <br/><br/>What role does combat play in your game?<br/><br/>You can't judge whether or not combat systems are working correctly or not until you answer this question.  Think about the difference between combat in D&amp;D and combat in Dogs in the Vineyard.  Both these games have combat systems that work.  Both combat systems are completely different.  Both games utilize combat for different things.  It's the fact that these systems want different things from combat that makes both work despite their vast differences.<br/><br/>So, what are you wanting combat to do in your game?<br/>Serve as an escalation for conflict?<br/>Simulate battlefield conditions accurately?<br/>Create an arena for competition?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity" title="Sempiternity"><img alt="Sempiternity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/bcp5010/stefan2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity">Sempiternity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59940/#Comment_59940" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T11:55:42+00:00" title="March  8, 2007 11:55AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2007 11:56AM by Sempiternity.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love Burning Wheel's melee combat rules.<br/><br/>I'd say the cleverest thing about it is that movements and actions are resolved at the same time, unlike most combat heavy rpgs, but still in detail.

Admittedly it's a social / emotional combat system, but it's a solid system, and the basic idea - the unequal dice pairs, extends far beyond social situations. <br/><br/>On a less self-plug note:<br/><br/>The problem with your attribute choices for Tokyo Heroes is that you have locked yourself into Attack, Defend, and Initiative, so there's not too much depth for interesting combat decisions - so it shouldn't be used for long combats. But in the source material (sentai and maho shoujo - for those unfamiliar) the combats are extremely short - everything is determined quickly - heroes either defeat their foe at a given power level /technique or must escalate to the next one. Perhaps something like a "let it ride" rule for combat would help, unless one side or the other escalates. <br/><br/>Come to think of it, that sort of escalation is common in related martial arts genres as well. Fights always go something like: basic technique, better technique, signature technique, signature technique with life on the line, last-ditch succession technique which you've never quite mastered. (Even bringing in allies works this way.) I'm reminded of Ruroni Kenshin and Bleach as typical examples of this sort of technique escalation. In D&amp;D if you hit repeat your action, it might work this turn, in anime and sentai shows a failing attack means that attack won't work unless you change something. <br/><br/>You know, listen to this more so than about Savagery here...<br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59948/#Comment_59948" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T12:39:30+00:00" title="March  8, 2007 12:39PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never played a fun combat system.

Which is that RPG systems do not actually create the cool color of action fights. All of that color is provided by the narration. To that extent, if your only goal is to have your fights be as colorful as, say, a martial arts movie, then you should not have a combat system.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr at least none that I've ever seen. And I really doubt that one could be devised that would aid a narrator in this. Because all systems slow things down. Whereas narration speed is the only thing that's going to even potentially create the sort of feel you're looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I think that even sans any system, your desire is doomed to fail. That is, what it sounds like to me is that you want to be able to create a movie in play. No, not action like that which happens in a movie, it sounds to me like you want pictures to erupt before you in real time. Just not going to happen. TTRPGs are a narrative form, and I just don't think that they deliver what you're asking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's not to say that they don't deliver other things. See Andrew's (Gaerik) post. There are fun things that a RPG system can provide. Even slow motion color, if you're into that. It'll just never excite you like some cimematic kinetics display.<br/>\n<br/>\nEwen, I've played tons of good combat systems. As Andrew says, all depends on what you're in the mood for. If I want to test my actual gamer abilities, in terms of tactics, etc, then The Riddle of Steel is number one (BW is OK, but largely comes down to Roshambo - even more than TROS does). But if I want to understand how my character plugs into the fight that's happening - in more detail than just TROS's spiritual attributes - then I want to play Hero Quest. If I want slow-mo detail, I'd play Phoenix Command...<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59976/#Comment_59976" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T14:21:30+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  2:21PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just had to link this:<br><br><a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=1010" rel="nofollow">DM of the Rings LXXII: A Truly Thrilling Encounter</a>.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity" title="Sempiternity"><img alt="Sempiternity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/bcp5010/stefan2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity">Sempiternity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60023/#Comment_60023" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T18:22:18+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  6:22PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>BW is OK, but largely comes down to Roshambo - even more than TROS does.</blockquote>\nHah!

After going the "traditional" route with CrossRoads combat system I tried for a more abstract system with Panty Explosion that pushes conflict over combat and totally relies on description. I know you're (Ewen)already familiar with it, but I thought it was worth mentioning. Mike Holmes wrote something a few years ago about having conflict resolution instead of combat, and ever since then the idea has struck me as veryy powerful and very right. So in Panty Explosion (and Classroom Deathmatch, which has much more fighting) players can bring on the crazy descriptions and super cool stunts and anthing else thats going to make the game what they want it to be. Success or failure is still determined by the roll of the dice, but what those rolls mean and how the events they represent play out are all up to the playaers imaginations. Of course theres tons of games that do this really well.<br/>\n<br/>\nJake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60040/#Comment_60040" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T21:34:24+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  9:34PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>I think you've got a sort of good point, Simon.

RPGs aren't like the movies, they're more like literature. And there's a reason there aren't many "action books" out there. In light of that, it's sort of surprising how important and common combat has become in RPGs, when the medium just isn't suited for it. Although historically, I guess it makes sense. It's also a bit funny how so many try to design combat systems that are "fast", when it simply will never be as fast as in the movies. I think I (and you, too, Ewen) might want to check out some literature that has good combat scenes. It can never be fast-paced in writing, so what makes 'em good there? If you can find that out, and make a mechanic that supports it, I'd say you're on your way to a good combat system.<br><br>My funnest combats have all been about conflict resolution, rather than task resolution. Instead of "I want to hit him", I'd say "I want to kick him out the window". It made for much more interesting scenes, and it gave room for ways that the fight could end other than "they die" or "you die."                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60041/#Comment_60041" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T21:45:29+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  9:45PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>BW is OK, but largely comes down to Roshambo - even more than TROS does</blockquote>Mike,<br>Do you mean Roshambo as in "rock, paper, scissors," or Roshambo as in "take turns kicking each other in the nuts" (the <i>South Park</i> definition)?<br><br>-- Alex                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity" title="Sempiternity"><img alt="Sempiternity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/bcp5010/stefan2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity">Sempiternity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60042/#Comment_60042" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T21:50:39+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  9:50PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2007 9:54PM by Sempiternity.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alex</cite><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>BW is OK, but largely comes down to Roshambo - even more than TROS does</blockquote>Mike,<br>Do you mean Roshambo as in "rock, paper, scissors," or Roshambo as in "take turns kicking each other in the nuts" (the<i>South Park</i>definition)?<br><br>I'd wager he meant RPS, but i took it as the latter - 'cause it's totally both! <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br><br/>(Most combat games boil down to RPS after enough iterations, though... move and countermove, and counter-countermove, and so on...)<br/><br/>(edit: by "combat games" i'm talking about the one-on-one interactions of units, within any game of war or strategy - think of the interactions of the pieces in Chess.

Unfortunately, even in 2nd edition counting successes still lags the system quite a bit.<br/><br/>Ditto on Iron Heroes - there's so much crunch people have to double-check their character sheets all the time to remember all the awesome their character is capable of. The zones idea from the GM's book is good, though, and they have a much more solid <i>mechanic</i> for stunts than Exalted does (though it's not any faster).<br/><br/>Shameless plug: In my current project (Sufficiently Advanced) I managed to make combat "scale" very well - you can start some psychohistorical maneuvering (timescale:years), initiate a presidential campaign to help with that (timescale:months), then the other side can launch a smear campaign through the media (timescale:weeks), then you challenge them to a debate (minutes), wherein someone else tries to shoot your candidate (seconds), and the lower ones affects the next higher one when they resolve. It also all feels like the regular game flow - no initiative, no special rules beyond some situational modifiers - so people can go in and out of conflict very easily. I'm proud of it.<br/><br/><b>More generally:</b> Incorporating player input can be done the Iron Heroes way (by providing useful scenery and rules to go with it), the Adventure! way (letting Inspiration points change the surroundings), the Amber way (description is <i>everything</i> because you can't pull dirty tricks without it), the Exalted/Wushu way (by giving bonuses for it), and no doubt in other ways as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60230/#Comment_60230" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-09T14:17:10+00:00" title="March  9, 2007  2:17PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gaerik</cite>The big question is..<br/><br/>What role does combat play in your game?<br/><br/>You can't judge whether or not combat systems are working correctly or not until you answer this question. Think about the difference between combat in D&amp;D and combat in Dogs in the Vineyard. Both these games have combat systems that work. Both combat systems are completely different. Both games utilize combat for different things. It's the fact that these systems want different things from combat that makes both work despite their vast differences.<br/><br/>So, what are you wanting combat to do in your game?<br/>Serve as an escalation for conflict?<br/>Simulate battlefield conditions accurately?<br/>Create an arena for competition?</blockquote>\nI think this is right, the first question is what purpose does combat serve in the game, the answer can take you to very different places.<br/><br/>Contenders, which I really hope to get to play this year, has combat as a vehicle for fundamental changes to the characters lives.  Runequest seeks to accurately model a melee, Millennium's Edge to accurately model modern gun combat, Over the Edge (which generated some of the best rpg combats I have seen) leaves it mainly to narration as combat is not a focus of play.<br/><br/>Combat in Dogs serves a different role to combat in Deluxe Recon.<br/><br/>So, the first question, is what do you want from combat in the game.
