And that's by including <br/>you in the creative process of a new television series called Bar Karma--the <br/>first show of its kind. Utilizing Will Wright's StoryMaker Engine, you can <br/>develop the stories and characters you want to see. You'll also be able to vote <br/>on ideas submitted by other members of the Creation Studios community. The most <br/>popular ideas will become contenders for the actual plot developments on the <br/>show, written and filmed by our professional production team. It's not reality <br/>television; it's real television made by real people, including you."<br/> <br/><a href="http://current.com/shows/bar-karma/92800839_bar-karma-the-most-mysterious-bar-in-the-universe.htm" rel="nofollow">http://current.com/shows/bar-karma/92800839_bar-karma-the-most-mysterious-bar-in-the-universe.htm</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
