Specifically, I want a game with the following attributes, or something close to it:<br/>- Good for two players. (GM-ful or GM-less doesn't matter much, as long as it's collaborative in that story-games way and works well with just two people.)<br/>- Has, or can be given, a sword-and-sorcery-ish vibe, or a dark fantasy vibe, or something of that sort. I'm more interested in alluring than gritty -- fantastical places, vibrant people, and lots of protagonist-y ass-kicking. In general, something that can carry a serious fantasy world and not make it feel like I'm just playing D&amp;D again.<br/>- Isn't too "heavy" but has fairly intensive conflict-oriented rules. I want something that's a bit more like DitV than PTA/TSOY-without-engaging-BDtP in this regard, though with fewer steps than DitV has, ideally.<br/>- With characters, gives you some hand-holds. By this I mean little mechanical bits that you can grab onto to really crystallize that character in your head. (It's fine if these elements aren't "gameable" at all, like how stats in Polaris don't really define your power.)<br/>- Makes magic quick, fun, and totally badass. (And, also, characters have to be able to pick it up and kick ass.)<br/>- Generally works well for stories of daring, sacrifice, power, and amazing baddassitude. With narrativist awesomeness but some room to pull it back a bit if you want to cool off or take it easy.<br/>- Is good for long-term open-ended casual-ish play. Like something we can pick up for two-three hours whenever we feel like it or file away for a while if we're not in the mood.<br/><br/>Some background to help:<br/>- I already have Trollbabe and TSOY in my possession. I've played TSOY and like it, and don't mind falling back to it for my gaming needs, but I feel like TSOY is better in a group. Trollbabe still awaits play -- the resolution mechanics seem cool but I think the other bits are a bit too light for this particular purpose.<br/>- I've also read Sorcerer &amp; Sword (and Sorcerer itself) but their focus isn't quite what I want.<br/>- I've heard good stuff about Conspiracy of Shadows and Reign, and want to learn more. CoS's rules kind of confused me when I looked at their wiki-fied form, but I still found them somewhat intriguing. Reign's ability to play both lone warrior and great king is appealing. Those are already on my radar, but I'd love to hear more about how they could relate to this-specific-thing-I-want-to-do-right-now.<br/>- I'm still, in some ways, a newbie to story-game-style play, and the person I'll be playing this with (my girlfriend) likes to tell stories and be awesome but is a little wary of feeling "pressured" to come up with things by the system.<br/><br/>-- Alex                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87578/#Comment_87578" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-11T23:58:12+00:00" title="August 11, 2007 11:58PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2007 11:58PM by Mike_Sands.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Beast Hunters might suit well, although the system does have some pressure built in.<br/><br/>Reign is probably more group oriented than TSOY for your purposes, although it could work well too. That opinion's based solely on reading, mind you - it might be fine. Also the system has a lot less direct player control than most story games. Stolze includes a few optional rules in this direction, but it still falls short of Keys in TSOY for controlling where the game goes. The magic in here is both pretty simple to get a handle on and totally badass, as are some of the esoteric disciplines and martial paths (i.e. cool stuff a character can learn to do).<br/><br/>HeroQuest might work too, that should be fine with two players and the system is probably about the level of crunch you describe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87594/#Comment_87594" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-12T03:03:34+00:00" title="August 12, 2007  3:03AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can only advise trying Trollbabe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87595/#Comment_87595" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-12T04:07:54+00:00" title="August 12, 2007  4:07AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about Mortal Coil?

Especially this part:<br/><br/><i>Generally works well for stories of daring, sacrifice, power, and amazing baddassitude.</i><br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, the <a>Beast Lunchers thread</a> is a great example of one-on-one play in short sessions.<br/><br/>You can check out the <a href="http://www.berengad.com/public/beasthunters_demo.pdf" rel="nofollow">free demo of the conflict resolution rules</a>. Some accounts of how that demo worked for people are posted here on SG, for example <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3427&amp;page=1#Item_19" rel="nofollow">in the Go Play NW thread</a> and, more focused on feedback for me, in the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3488" rel="nofollow">Demo thread</a>.  <br/><br/>You can always take the pressure down by making challenges easier or resolving them through Negotiation (not shown in the demo).  Brand <a href="http://chgriffen.livejournal.com/143599.html?thread=725231#t725231" rel="nofollow">talks about playing many short evening sessions with Mo</a> that were more focused on Negotiation and collaborative storytelling rather than step on up challenge-based play.<br/><br/>I would have also suggested Sorcerer, but you already said that it doesn't strike the right chord for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87616/#Comment_87616" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-12T08:26:32+00:00" title="August 12, 2007  8:26AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it's not going to be Sorcerer or The Shadow of Yesterday, I think you ought to take a closer look at <a href="http://www.bobgoat.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mechanics" rel="nofollow">Conspiracy of Shadows</a>.<br/><br/>The conflict system is quite nice: sort of a mix of tSoY (conflict setup, "weapons") with Burning Wheel (maneuvers though they're optional), without being as complicated as either Bringing Down the Pain or scripting. It works for all types of conflicts, not just combat. There's the quite nice addition of Momentum, which gives some additional interesting tactical choices without layering on the complexity.<br/><br/>Between the Witchblood and Ritual Magic, you should be able to cover any Sword &amp; Sorcery-type magic you can dream up. The mechanics of it are fairly simple too.<br/><br/>One thing that doesn't get touched on often is that Keith actually did some very good work in the Creating the Game and Playing the Game sections. He walks you through creating a series and the elements of a good episode. It's a great primer.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's worth giving it another shot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87632/#Comment_87632" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-12T10:09:56+00:00" title="August 12, 2007 10:09AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Alex, even though Thor did not, I am going to recommend Burning Wheel.
