In more structured games, teams are handed the initiative and in less structured they have to seize it.  Surely the latter is better for drama?

While I do feel that your definition is a bit too narrow to my taste (though I'm yet to find a better one, I'm afraid), I feel like your descriptions of structured and un-structured games \u2013 while fascinating \u2013 lead me to a different conclusion: un-structured games don't necessarily lead to better drama, even by your definition. True, they can be less surprising (though not always), yet they can lead to huge amounts of drama \u2013 just look at some of the Nordic freeform games. Some of the games I've ran and/or played were extremely structured and without a tidbit of a surprising happening. Sometimes, knowing one will have to make a difficult choice is more dramatic that being surprised with having to make one on the spot (I think Hitchcock said something about it, will have to look for the quote when I'm back home).<br/>\tTo put it differently, I'm not sure one method is absolutely better at creating drama.

I don't think it needs to be exciting for it to be dramatic either.

The more rules there are about something, the more it matters; it's a simple issue of attention on the author and the player's part. <br/>As a player, you don't have the luxury of deciding what is important: if you do, you are modifying the game (and fighting against it) or using it as a customizable toolkit to create the actual game you mean to play, instead of following the rules.<br/><br/>This principle goes further than specialized rule systems that emphasize as much as desired obvious, "realistic" elements of the fiction (e.g. D&amp;D has many ways to attack more effectively and defend more effectively in melee, but nothing about accounting or mathematics even if both activities obviously occur somewhere offscreen).<br/>RPG rules can (and should) also deliberately distort realism to offer abstractions and models with a certain behaviour (e.g. many games restrict themselves to fungible "hit points" to avoid dealing with localized wounds and their varied and debatable effects) and they often define systems of completely abstract entities they are dealing with (e.g. periods and events in <i>Microscope</i>, character level and alignment in D&amp;D, moves in PbtA and similar games, scenes and player turns in too many games to count).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480550/#Comment_480550" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-19T18:04:13+00:00" title="February 19, 2019  6:04PM">February 19</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The idea that what matters is in the rules I have found incomplete.
