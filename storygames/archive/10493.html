It's very nice to meet you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've played a few story-type games in my day, and I've even had the great opportunity to attend Jiffycon over the summer; it's great fun. I'm fascinated by the culture of people who play story games; the shared terms and continuing discussions. There is clearly a growing community with an emerging identity all its own. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my Writing and Rhetoric class, we are being asked to write a fieldworking research paper on a subculture of some sort, and I intend to focus on those who play story games, which is to say "The Story Gamers." I was wondering if anyone here would like to share their thoughts on the subject or would be willing to be interviewed as a member of the community. <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you very much for your time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233126/#Comment_233126" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T18:57:19+00:00" title="September 18, 2009  6:57PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2009 6:58PM by Judd.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure.<br/><br/>What do ya need?<br/><br/>EDIT: Why is it doing this again?

Well, you see, I'm interested in learning about how people who play story games view other story gamers. I mean, do you feel a sense of camaraderie? Who are the people who play these games and how does it affect their lives? I mean, the hobby is obviously growing, but how does the community help or hamper that? Has there ever been a time when you've felt you've identified as a part of this thing that's bigger than just you? Just go nuts, guys.

Although he doesn't identify with "the community" (because he hasn't designed, not interested in designing, issues aimed at designers, etc; it just so happens that a lot of the vocal members here are either doing design or interested in it as well as play the games, too), he is nevertheless an important member of these forums (because he does PLAY these games, he is a player and GM, is somewhat up-to-speed on the games coming out of the S-G scene, plus organizes community events aimed at making playing role-playing games more fun ---&gt; Which is exactly the goal of this actual website, in the end).<br/><br/>So I think his viewpoint might be worthwhile. <i>He's like Eric from Head of the Class</i>: Technically is 'one of us' because of what he does and who he is, though his focus/interests in many ways are outside the focus/interests of others here (design-wise, design-focus, etc).<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://thepilver.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/head-of-the-class-1.jpg"/><br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233210/#Comment_233210" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-19T13:47:47+00:00" title="September 19, 2009  1:47PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>JD's post is very interesting.

First and foremost, lots of experts seem to disagree about what exactly constitutes a community, so we're in good company. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_community" rel="nofollow">Virtual Community</a> article is also really interesting.<br/><br/>One of the definitions includes four elements of "sense of community": 1) membership, 2) influence, 3) integration and fulfillment of needs, and 4) shared emotional connection. Call me crazy, but I get that stuff from my interactions with storygamers online on forums and in private correspondence, and offline at game conventions and in my house and other people's houses. <br/><br/>The idea of "social capital" also seems to be an element of communities, and there's definitely a bit of that involved in the storygaming-community. I'd argue that some of the folks who fight against the idea of there being a storygamer community actually have a fair amount of social capital in this gaming subculture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
