Start with imagining what the demon looks like an what you would like it to do, then go to the list of abilities and look for ways to combine them to produce the desired effect.  When I GM Sorcerer I rarely have the players look at the list of abilities.  I just ask them to tell me what the demon does and I write it up myself.  After all, it\u2019s my NPC anyway.<br/><br/>Playing the Build-a-Demon game is one of my favorite Sorcerer \u201cexercises.\u201d  Let\u2019s play a couple rounds right now.  I\u2019m thinking of little girl Sorcerer named Emily and her \u201cimaginary\u201d friend Billy.  Billy is an inconspicuous demon that protects Emily from harm.  Any damage done to Emily is done to Billy instead.  So, how to best accomplish this?<br/><br/>Well the most obvious choice is Armor that confers to Emily.  That will handle the damage reduction part but what about the transfer?  The ability Link is a foundational start.  I see two options for actually hurting Billy.<br/><br/>1)\tThe Currency Way: For every victory converted to Fists damage by the Armor ability simply apply damage to Billy based on the original weapon chart.<br/><br/>2)\tThe Ability Purest Way: Give Billy Special Damage (Non-Lethal).  Every time Emily gets hit the GM simply has Billy attack himself the following round.  That may sound kind of dumb but it\u2019s not when you describe it correctly.  Basically while Emily is standing there absorbing bullets, Billy is reeling around in pain.  It\u2019s kind of a creepy image.<br/><br/>Here\u2019s one I got recently that was a bit of challenge.  The player wanted her possessor demon (hosted in an animal) to be able to see past and future events.  I pointed out the ability Hint but she felt that was overkill because she didn\u2019t care about accuracy, reliability or deliberateness of it.  She liked the idea of it being kind of dreamy, metaphorical and impossible to interpret.  I realized that what she was doing was basically handing me a ready made Bang delivery system.<br/><br/>Here\u2019s the core challenge: The animal host can\u2019t talk and possessors can\u2019t confer their abilities beyond their host.  So how does the player character actually have access to this prophetic information?  Well for obtaining the information itself I went with Perception (Short Range Time Stream).  I noticed that Link includes a \u201cgeneral awareness\u201d of the demon\u2019s immediate surroundings so I figured that was sufficient to act as the \u201cdelivery system\u201d for intentionally vague and dream-like \u201cvisions.\u201d   As a general note I wouldn\u2019t have allowed this ability or would have insisted on using Hint if the player had wanted perfect \u201csecond sight\u201d so to speak.<br/><br/>So, let\u2019s get into the text of demon abilities a bit and discuss all those seemingly out of place complexities and details.  First let me say that all the mechanical bits of demon abilities are just applications of the currency system used to adjudicate (the word \u201cmodel\u201d is inappropriate) \u201cweird effects.\u201d  If your problem with demon abilities is that the mechanics of Armor converting victories to Fist damage seems like overkill relative to the rest of the system then I suggest that your understanding of the currency system is too simplistic.  It isn\u2019t that the demon abilities should be simplified to fit the rest of the system; it\u2019s that the application of the system to other situations should be elevated to the complexity of the demon abilities.  I suggest that adjudicating such things as suppressive automatic fire, grenades, lasting emotional distress, the narrative impact of \u201cset pieces\u201d or thematic objects, is much more akin to how demon abilities work than the simple victory roll-over mechanic.  I suggest going over the rules with this in mind: All the \u201cdice tricks\u201d listed are not exceptions or special cases.  They are examples of the currency applied to a few common situations but are no means \u201cexhaustive\u201d rules.<br/><br/>The trickier part of demon abilities is all the text that seems rather limiting compared to the customizable flexibility of the game.  Examples include the size limitations listed under the ability Big, the duration limitations on Shapeshift or the speed limitations on Travel.  Ron has admitted that this text is some of the weakest in the book.  What I intend to do here is throw out a few basic principles that will hopefully make it easier to understand this text in a functional manner.<br/><br/>The first principle is that nothing in Sorcerer is instant, infinite, eternal or can be diminished to zero.  The idea here is that even if your demon can teleport there is always the chance that something can interfere with that.  If you go gallivanting around as a werewolf all night long that has consequences.  When some action is successful it has some minimal impact and can\u2019t be totally negated.  Regardless of what an ability can do there are always opportunities for outside forces to interfere or take advantage of it.<br/><br/>The second principle is about understanding that the text was written with certain narrative assumptions (more on this in the third principle).  Mainly, modern occult stories such as Hellblazer and The Exorcist and all the Swords &amp; Sorcery stuff listed in that supplement.  As such the abilities are all written with that particular look and feel in mind.  A consequence of this is that some abilities may need customizing if your game steps outside those narrative assumptions.  The text simply didn\u2019t account for demonic black holes and virtual reality subroutines.  This is really no different from customizing the list of descriptors to change the nature of appropriate Sorcerer character types.<br/><br/>The third principle is that the verb \u201cmodel\u201d is inappropriate when discussing Sorcerer.  The rules of Sorcerer do not model anything.  They do not model the fictional world.  They do not model the fictional world as represented by the source fiction.  They do not even model the source fiction itself.  What they do is adjudicate the narrative weight of consequential action relative to the here and now fictional situation.<br/><br/>What this means for demon abilities is that stuff like duration and speed kick-in only when that would have weight in the narrative.  If Jack Bauer can make it from Santa Monica to Downtown L.A. in 15 minutes through rush hour traffic than so can your demon moving at \u201cnormal human speed\u201d right up until all of a sudden we\u2019re stuck in traffic and that bomb is going to go off in 15 minutes.  Those eight minutes of Shapeshift on your Power 8 werewolf demon start ticking when a character is locked in the basement and says, \u201cIf we can just make it until dawn then he\u2019ll have worn himself out.\u201d<br/><br/>So, that\u2019s my attempt to get at the underlying principles behind Demon Abilities.  I hope it has been useful.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135857/#Comment_135857" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T14:36:36+00:00" title="March 21, 2008  2:36PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> Those eight minutes of Shapeshift on your Power 8 werewolf demon start ticking when a character is locked in the basement and says, \u201cIf we can just make it until dawn then he\u2019ll have worn himself out.\u201d</blockquote>\nOh.

Sorcerer resolution requires motivated action towards that goal and if you break it down that way, you'll see that you're really rolling a bunch of other conflicts.<br/><br/>First we bar the door!  It holds!<br/>The werewolf starts tearing up the floorboards!  We snap shot a Contain rune on them.  The Werewolf recoils in pain!<br/><br/>etc.<br/><br/>The durations gives all of that OTHER action context, particularly how often Shapeshift needs to be reapplied, whether the Demon starts "fatiguing" and at what point it goes into need from sustaining the shapeshift for too long as per the Demon Abilities &amp; Stamina rules.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135866/#Comment_135866" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T15:52:47+00:00" title="March 21, 2008  3:52PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2008 3:53PM by Alan.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I have to agree about the interpretation of what can be rolled for in this case. I got that from Ron's posts too. I'm disapointed because at one point, I thought the technique might eliminate the need for durations and dimensions for abilities.<br/><br/>About duration and fatigue for shapechange -- I think I'm understanding that, as long as the werewolf doesn't get involved in a scene, he can be assumed to run around in changed form all night long -- the duration and fatigue limitations only kick in when a scene is in play. Does that agree with how you see this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135869/#Comment_135869" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T16:07:11+00:00" title="March 21, 2008  4:07PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, with one caveat.  If the "running around all night" suddenly becomes relevant.  Like the player deliberately waits until just before dawn to go confront the thing.  Thus the "running around all night" is now a relevant tactical consideration (and not just narrative color).  Thus it's a simple matter of saying that the werewolf shows up fatigued and in Need assuming certain Power and Stamina ranges.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
