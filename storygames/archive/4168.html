I was looking at insuring our big screen TV (because, y'know, <i>kids</i>) and I pointed out that with the rapid turnover in models, such insurance must provide powerful problems to the insurance agency ... not being able to monitor whether people keep taking care of their precious (but now accidentally refundable!) hardware.  My wife handed me the term <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard" rel="nofollow">moral hazard</a>, and I immediately thought "Oh!  I get an immediate sense of what that term is ... there's a danger in incenting people in some way that they'll act in ways counter to the original purpose.  Happens in RPG design all the time.  But OH, what a shame it's so provocatively phrased.  It's not necessarily about morality at all, after all."<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I went and found out that it's not actually about incentives (directly) either, but a special case ... anyway, it's the wrong term, and I was momentarily excited because I thought "Maybe the <b>right</b> term isn't so freighted!  It'd be nice to have a way to talk about how games with certain incentives don't <i>force</i> anyone to do wierd stuff, but can create an environment that powerfully influences them in one direction or another."<br/>\n<br/>\nSadly, the correct term (I think) is <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive" rel="nofollow">perverse incentive</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo these people WANT to make it impossible to use these terms to a layman without insulting them?

Sometimes rules systems don't actually end up encouraging the sort of behavior their designers intended for them to encourage.<br/><br/>Example:  I tested out a game (long ago) where people <i>could not</i> gain happiness for themselves, but rather could only be given happiness (and empowerment) by other people who sympathized with their plight.  Sounded good enough, was intended as a whole uplifting "Look to each other for strength" thing, but the players took the incentive to its ultimate extreme, and many of the characters very rapidly set out to be radically self-destructive (bordering on the actively suicidal) because they were incentivized for getting people to <i>notice</i> how much they were hurting.<br/><br/>Now if I were to discuss such a ruleset with people who are using it and who are NOT going in that direction, should I say "Well, this game will make your characters suicidal"?  Nah ... it hasn't made <i>their</i> characters suicidal.  But there's a perverse incentive there ... and it'd be nice to have a clean term to discuss that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93498/#Comment_93498" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T11:20:44+00:00" title="September  6, 2007 11:20AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>But there's a perverse incentive there ... and it'd be nice to have a clean term to discuss that.</blockquote>\nDev's right on the money with "unintended consequences".

In fact, I'm probably going to go away from these boards using the term "perverse incentive" to describe every instance of a game mechanic which either undermines the system or takes some negative aspect of the system to extreme, but logical, extremes.<br/>\n<br/>\n(For instance, in the old White Wolf LARP mechanics, you could take "Shy" as a drawback, thereby making your character more powerful. The perverse incentive this created was a desire in players to avoid interacting with one another, because they were so into their Shy But Powerful characters. Since LARP rather requires a great deal of interaction in order to fly, well, for most people, anyway, this made for some dull games. I remember walking into a room once where six unimaginably-powerful, city-controlling overlords were all sulkily facing different directions, unable to even make eye-contact, let alone work out an age-old delimma or order their minions about.

Unintended consequences may or may not be perverse, meaning creating consequences that run <b>counter </b>to the interests of the one who is making the incentives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110646/#Comment_110646" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T09:01:21+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  9:01AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "perverse incentive" already exists and has a definition that one can apply.
