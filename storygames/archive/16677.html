If you have a game in need of playtesting, we will do you the dis/honor of playing those games for you. Look at our podcast's blog for examples of the games we playtested for others.<br/><br/><a href="http://momsbasementpodcast.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://momsbasementpodcast.blogspot.com/</a><br/><br/>The format is we record the playtest, send you a link to listen to it, and talk about the game on the podcast. We will give your game the full treatment; the good, the bad, and the weird. So, if all that fits your needs, send it. We won't immediately play your game, but we usually play them in less than a month. In general, we will usually tell you when we plan on playtesting.<br/><br/>Send us your game to: momsbasement@miserytourism.com                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381359/#Comment_381359" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T23:53:53+00:00" title="June  7, 2012 11:53PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would you playtest a game that required you to learn the Korean alphabet before playing?

If so, I've got a game for you! (Not even a little sarcastic)</blockquote>\nIf everything we needed to learn was included in the game's text, yes, we would.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arpie</cite>Can we vote for guys we'd like to see get played? </blockquote>\nIn the past, we've basically just had a queue, with the designers who submit their games first getting played and reviewed first. We try to get to everyone, so there shouldn't be a need to vote. If there's a designer whose game you'd like to see playtested, just encourage them to submit it.<br/><br/>We haven't taken requests from people other than the designers in the past. Since these games are usually works-in-progress and since we will be critiquing them on a public broadcast (albeit one with a tiny audience), I feel its best to at least get the designer's permission. I can imagine some people being concerned about a discussions that mentions some of the (perceived) bugs in an unfinished game getting out.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arpie</cite>I like to see new designers get a shake.</blockquote>\nDitto. That's really my primary motivation for doing this.<br/><br/>Plus, we've discovered some really awesome games in the process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381369/#Comment_381369" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-08T02:36:28+00:00" title="June  8, 2012  2:36AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You guys will hear from me in a couple months, I promise!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381374/#Comment_381374" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-08T03:30:47+00:00" title="June  8, 2012  3:30AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafu</cite>You guys will hear from me in a couple months, I promise!</blockquote>\nLooks like you need a vision quest.

Even then, a little jab isn't too bad, as long as it was only set to stun. Initially when the crew talked about it, we were a little hesitant because we knew you guys would have games for people to read. Even though this isn't Praxis, fellow story gamers do have ideas for what constitute a game. They also need playtesters, badly.<br/><br/>Pretty much the first concern was getting too many requests at once since nobody I know told you guys up front about us being a playtester for games. I just saw too many people in the 'small games subscription' and the 'what would you like a designer forum to be' want playtesters and was a wee bit surprised since Mom's Basement had given the shout out around March 2011. It was sort of a, "Dude, why haven't those Story-Games people heard about us?"<br/><br/>Overall though, I'm with William on this. If too many people send their games, temporary shut down for requests (but not forever). Make sure your game has a solid foundation. If you don't really know what you are doing, it'll reflect in your rule set and how we play your game, for better or worse. Also, if we start getting a lot of requests, it'll be unlikely we get a second time around to help you. I'm not saying to send us gold, but make sure you have what you think is the core point of your game done. Whether that is the resolution system (like for my game, Crystal Capers), or the setting, because it'll probably be your only chance for us to playtest your game on the podcast.<br/><br/>Much love my peeps, and I look forward to playing your game. Side note: Sean Nittner, WTF man?! You have your forums on RPG Crosstalk with us and our plea for playtesting games is on there. Just kidding, but truly though, did you not see it? I know Jenn from the Jennisodes hinted about maybe sending us her game (that Ninja Panda Taco Project), but no word so far. Also, I understand you're a busy guy, it just threw me off because of that. No hard feelings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Nittner" title="Sean Nittner"><img alt="Sean Nittner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Nittner">Sean Nittner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381455/#Comment_381455" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-08T11:46:21+00:00" title="June  8, 2012 11:46AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whduryea</cite><br/>Sean, can you send us an email?
