You can find a lot of series bibles, pitches and pilot scripts in this <a href="http://leethomson.myzen.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">archive</a>, including bibles for <a href="http://leethomson.myzen.co.uk/Star_Trek/3_Deep_Space_Nine/Star_Trek_-_Deep_Space_Nine_Bible.pdf" rel="nofollow">Deep Space Nine</a> and <a href="http://leethomson.myzen.co.uk/The_Wire/The_Wire_-_Bible.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Wire</a>.<br/><br/>My question to you is whether an RPG could follow a similar format. I imagine a long-form Lady Blackbird, with a cast of pre-gen protagonists, secondary characters, loosely outlined setting and a bunch of situations for them to be in. Would something like that be interesting? Would it seem too much like a frustrated novelist publishing his notebook as an RPG? :P                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312807/#Comment_312807" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T06:00:22+00:00" title="February 16, 2011  6:00AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first impulse would be to build my own, which is sort of what you end up doing with PTA.

It's my way of getting the characters snugly into the setting and making sure that future adventure ideas stem from them or are otherwise thematically about them, etc. A series bible is sort of like the RPG core or sourcebook for the TV series, in some cases, but with a much stronger ability to mandate or predict what will come in the future, since gameplay isn't a consideration.<br/><br/>It's not revolutionary, but this is sort of what my side project, <i><a href="http://wordstudio.net/thegist/?p=2340" rel="nofollow">Databank</a></i>, does\u2014establish a trajectory through a narrative as a kind of linked series of situation-driven scenarios with the same characters. Pre-defined episodes. And the series bible is sort of how I've been approaching part of the product itself. <br/><br/>So, I think series bibles are a great resource for world-builders in any profession to get familiar with, and they certainly have value for the RPG creator, from designer through to GM. They're like reading the outline for some favored source material\u2014often informative.<br/><br/>That said, I'm not sure about posting that link here, Daniel. Those scripts and bibles are almost certainly not the property of whoever's hosting them, there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DaveC" title="DaveC"><img alt="DaveC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DaveC">DaveC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312833/#Comment_312833" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T08:18:46+00:00" title="February 16, 2011  8:18AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>Primarily, the difference would be that the game assumes you're playing those premade characters.

TV series do tend to go through some pretty heavy cast changes over time.<br/><br/>That's interesting. What struck me in reading through the bible for The Wire from Daniel's link is how much change there apparently was between the draft of that document and the filming of the first episode. Not only character names, but also some fundamental character characteristics. In an RPG sense, I wonder if you could have the GM come up with the initial bible, but then have the players customize it before the cameras start to roll. <br/><br/>If not, I expect the tool could be considered too over-prescriptive. One of the purposes of the TV series bible is to have a document you can point to when writing an individual episode in order to say "no, that character wouldn't do that". If you try to use that to constrain players actions during a game (the closest analog, I guess), you're liable to get some static, and rightly so.<br/><br/>Interestingly, I think in older TV shows when bibles like this were less common, it often fell to the actor portraying the character to be the primary keeper of character continuity, since the writers could change so often over the course of the series. Leonard Nimoy had some reflections on this; in the original Star Trek series, he became the defacto judge of what Spock would or wouldn't do, with the power to override the writers. Some of this is attributable to where he sat on the totem pole, of course, but it was also true that he had the most consistent picture of the character by virtue of his position.<br/><br/>I do think that the "Setting" pages in some of these bibles are excellent examples of how to get across the essentials of a setting in a very short document. People in Hollywood have notoriously short attention spans, it is said. Being able to boil down so much information about your show (or your game) into a single page is a great skill to have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312969/#Comment_312969" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T17:03:22+00:00" title="February 16, 2011  5:03PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will Hindmarch</cite>I'm not sure about posting that link here, Daniel.
