We've had two sessions; the first one was just character building (including kickers and demons), the second real play. We're playing in Louis XIVs court.<br/><br/>The thing I like the most, I think, is how it hones my thinking. It is demanding, and I've done a LOT of prep (much more than for any recent campaign I can recall). Watched several movies. Read dozens of Wikipedia articles. Set up detailed R-maps in google docs. Written historical timelines. Read and re-read the book, including parts of the supplements. Each player has their own little binder/folder, with all the papers they need, and their own pencil with a fake gem on the end <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> (so cute! and I love how doing little things like this makes the whole experience a little more meaningful.)<br/><br/>I plan the sessions from a facilitating perspective: We need to try this out, I should explain this, let's spend some time making sure these kickers work and these questions are answered before play. <br/><br/>Knowing where to focus is essential, too. Ron does tend to say "this is hugely important and don't ever forget it" about a lot of things (in my reading), but in Sorcerer, I think this is #1: Sorcerers must have a strong motivation. In this case, one character wants eternal life; another wants to be the king's favorite mistress (which, if you know the setting, is extremely hard and might get you killed); and a third wants to be king instead of the king.<br/><br/>I was sort of worried about the bangs. But, possibly due to a lot of GMing experience and a touch of sadism, they were easy to administer, both planned ones and on-the-fly ones.<br/><br/>My main worry is how to keep the pressure high, but not make the players feel completely powerless and over-frustrated. So I've asked each of them for feedback on whether they want more, less or the same amount of challenge and trouble next session.<br/><br/>We've only rolled dice a few times, but it mattered when it happened, and it's a good way to show what the characters can do - and where they should be careful. A staring contest with a countess, resolved with dice, showed the players how badass the countess was (and what to expect from the inner courts of the King). The whole thing where you can use victories from one conflict as dice for another is very promising, too, and will probably make for some cool play.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398322/#Comment_398322" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T09:25:34+00:00" title="November 21, 2012  9:25AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds line a great setup <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I hope you'll keep writing about how it's going.<br/><br/>Hans said something recently that I experienced, too: Sorcerer can be intimidating, but it's actually petty easy once you get the hang of it.<br/><br/>That one thing you point out, the strong motivations?

We had a character building session last week and are playing again this week (<a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/adept/index.php?topic=72.0" rel="nofollow">more about our game here</a>). We're doing Sorcerer &amp; Sword, using the Dictionary of Mu setting supplement.<br/><br/>For the first session at least, this\n<blockquote>I plan the sessions from a facilitating perspective: We need to try this out, I should explain this, let's spend some time making sure these kickers work and these questions are answered before play. </blockquote>\nseemed to work well. We took a very long time to make characters, but I was constantly drilling things down into the realm of the concrete, and I think we have a very juicy, tangible set-up thanks to that. The players were very committed to making interesting, fleshed-out characters, and in the case where a character may not be as interesting to the other players as another character, they at least all have strong motivation, as you've said.<br/><br/>Also, as you've said, a lot of prep has helped in this regard. I've listened to every podcast talking about Sorcerer probably three times, I recently re-read Sorcerer, Sorcerer &amp; Sword, and Dictionary of Mu twice each, I'm reading Conan stories and the Book of the New Sun as we speak, and I'll be doing my game prep and R-map tonight (I don't tend to watch movies much as prep, but then I don't watch many movies anyway). I'm a teensy nervous about providing good bangs, but I think running a lot of Apocalypse World has taught me about this, as well as just running a lot of different games for a lot of different people at meetups. Playing Sorcerer with Jesse doesn't hurt at all, either.\n<blockquote>T\\<br/>Hans said something recently that I experienced, too: Sorcerer can be intimidating, but it's actually petty easy once you get the hang of it.</blockquote>\nThat may have been me RTing Ron, or something? I don't remember. Anyway, I hope to find out that's true! Ron did say this, in any case: "The problem is not that the game is too hard or requires too much, but that it's way simpler than most people expect. Enjoying it is more about what not to do, not what to do."<br/><br/>I look forward to hearing more about your game, Matthjis!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398361/#Comment_398361" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T16:30:25+00:00" title="November 21, 2012  4:30PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you guys like the supplements?<br/>I have Soul, but I'm not sure if I'd want to bother with Sex or Swords.
