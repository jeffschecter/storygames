I want to focus more on inspiring settings I'd love to play - without being too judgemental about the underlying system.<br/><br/>Last year 2015, I've spent way more time designing games and hacking them than actually really playing. When looking at a new game, I started dissecting (and harvesting) the underlying mechanics before I even had a chance to appreciate the full game. Before giving a new game a chance, I'd already started hacking it in my head to improve it.<br/>Often, I've ignored entire settings and adventures as mere "fluff", focusing only on the skeleton of the system. And there is so much stuff I've developed, that has never been played...<br/><br/>So, this year 2016, I want to resist the tempation of analyzing every new game mechanic I see. Instead, I want to focus on games and settings I'm actually excited to play. <br/>Oh, I've also started to like <i>play-by-post</i>, so I want to go deeper into that.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
