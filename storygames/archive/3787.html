The game is set in the world of The Night Watch (loosely) in Seattle (setting = about 4 printed Google maps, and LOTS of Starbucks gags). As I've mentioned, the players are lit the fuck up, and it's been some of the hands-down most awesome gaming I've done, like EVARRRRrrrr (tm).<br/><br/>That being said, I have a lot of small questions (some which I can't recall now but will undoubtedly remember later). Looking for help from folks in the know.<br/><br/>1) Because I won some conflicts, as GM my hand is full of the player's cards that I took from them after increasing the suffering of their aspects.  I have about, say, 7 of these cards ("Hero Deck Cards").  Then, in the next conflict I throw them down against the players. After that next conflict is over, where do those cards go? Do they go back into the Hero discard pile (because they originally came from the hero's deck) or the villain discard pile?<br/><br/>2A) What's a good way to do GM enrichment scenes without performing a puppet-play in front of the players?  <br/>Up until now, I realize that I've done few (that is, only 2 scenes in three play sessions), and I guess I haven't found a good reason to do them, and take the spotlight off the player characters to spotlight the villains (not entirely true: I have just realized now that there were a few "cool things" that I could have revealed about the villains through GM enrichment scenes). Thoughts?<br/><br/>2B) What's a good ratio of "GM scene to Player scene"? <br/><br/>3) In enrichment scenes with multiple PCs/heroes, the card value is "+1". Just curious as to the reasoning behind that?<br/><br/>4) In an enrichment scene between 3 players and Me, the GM: A pullls a 3 of hearts, B pulls a 6 of clubs, The GM pulls a 9 of hearts, and Player C pulls a 10 of diamonds. I assume that Player A gets his 3 of hearts back with the GM's 9 of hearts.  What happens to Player B and Player C's cards? <br/>*OR, is this incorrect, and the GM should actually be pulling one Enrichment card to oppose every player (instead of one card, the GM should place 3 cards)?<br/><br/>5) What's so bad about Devastated aspects?  "Devastated Aspects belong to the GM"... what does that really mean, though? It seems that, from a story perspective, as well as looking at those juicy wilds, it's quite interesting as a player to have one or more aspects get devestated.

The principle is the same with cards the players take from the Villain Deck--they get returned to the Villain discard pile.\n<blockquote>2A) What's a good way to do GM enrichment scenes without performing a puppet-play in front of the players?<br/>Up until now, I realize that I've done few (that is, only 2 scenes in three play sessions), and I guess I haven't found a good reason to do them, and take the spotlight off the player characters to spotlight the villains (not entirely true: I have just realized now that there were a few "cool things" that I could have revealed about the villains through GM enrichment scenes). Thoughts?</blockquote>\nDo it the same way players would! You take the role of the villain you're enriching, and hand out other parts in the scene to the players of your choice. Give them their motivation and go!\n<blockquote>2B) What's a good ratio of "GM scene to Player scene"?</blockquote>\nI usually start with one enrichment scene for a villain every time all the players have had an enrichment scene. Sometimes it's good to do an enrichment scene for each villain early on, just to give the players an idea of what they're up to.\n<blockquote>3) In enrichment scenes with multiple PCs/heroes, the card value is "+1". Just curious as to the reasoning behind that?</blockquote>\nSimple! It encourages players to bring their characters together in Enrichment scenes and start twining their hero lives and personal lives together.\n<blockquote>4) In an enrichment scene between 3 players and Me, the GM: A pullls a 3 of hearts, B pulls a 6 of clubs, The GM pulls a 9 of hearts, and Player C pulls a 10 of diamonds. I assume that Player A gets his 3 of hearts back with the GM's 9 of hearts.  What happens to Player B and Player C's cards?<br/>*OR, is this incorrect, and the GM should actually be pulling one Enrichment card to oppose every player (instead of one card, the GM should place 3 cards)?</blockquote>\nYou should use one card per player with a conflict in the scene. If the player loses the conflict he gets your card and the card he played back. If the player wins the conflict, you take his card and your own card back.\n<blockquote>5) What's so bad about Devastated aspects?  "Devastated Aspects belong to the GM"... what does that really mean, though? It seems that, from a story perspective, as well as looking at those juicy wilds, it's quite interesting as a player to have one or more aspects get devestated. Fact or Un-Fact?</blockquote>\nYou want to Devastate aspects in order to get more Wild Cards! But at the same time, Devastated aspects no longer generate new cards for you. And, in fact, the GM now has control of those aspects and may increase their Suffering as he would his own aspects, generating more cards for him! So you gain more Wild Cards when you Devastate aspects, but you also give the GM more resources.<br/><br/>In addition, aspects that are Devastated are now in danger. That aspect is going to change in some way. It has to. But the question becomes: will the player define that change or will the GM? If the GM can increase the Suffering of your Devastated aspect to Transformed on his track, then he gets to tell you how that aspect has changed!<br/><br/>This is how you strip the Adamantium from an Adamantium Skeleton, or turn America's Champion into Public Enemy Number One and so on. <br/><br/>In the course of an issue you can do all those things through Suffering, but until it reaches Transformed it doesn't "stick." Once it's been Transformed it stays that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84949/#Comment_84949" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T09:33:29+00:00" title="August  2, 2007  9:33AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very slick, Thor, you've covered each and every one of my questions.<br/><br/>Anyone ready to take on the BONUS QUESTION CHALLENGE?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84963/#Comment_84963" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T10:03:16+00:00" title="August  2, 2007 10:03AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The best answer is probably to get Michael or Kat to send you a copy of one of their demo scenarios. Both of them run awesome 3 to 4 hour games.<br/><br/>Other than that: pre-gen characters with 3 aspects (fewer than that and the players will struggle to generate cards). Let them choose the aspect that appeals to them as the Strife aspect and craft your Plan around that.<br/><br/>With a maximum of 3 players you only need one villain, which is good. Since they'll all be focusing on the one villain, you'll probably want at least 3 aspects (including The Plan) so they don't blow you away too quickly.<br/><br/>Finally, allow each card spent on the Story Arc to cover two spaces rather than just one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans" title="Hans"><img alt="Hans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans">Hans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84978/#Comment_84978" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T10:31:37+00:00" title="August  2, 2007 10:31AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since Andy brought the subject, and risking being designated a thread hijacker, here is a question or two I have about WGP:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Supervillain teams:  I can see different ways to work this.  1) Each villain is its own sheet with its own plan.  2) There is one sheet, say with "Syndicate of Evil" as its "name", and each villain is listed as a separate asset (probably power).  3) There is one sheet, but only one Power Asset ("Powers of the Syndicate of Evil") and any other aspects that are appropriate. 4) Extra villains are just color, like Polarity as hero colour in the example in the rule book, 5) some combination of the above; some villains have their own sheets and plans, others are combined, others are just color.  Any thoughts and/or actual experience on how this works best? <br/>\n<br/>\n* Thor suggests that for three playes, the villain should have three aspects.  Is this a hint at a rule of thumb (# heroes = # of villain aspects)?  Or is it not so simple.  How do you best determine how many villains/villain aspects is bring to the table for X players given Y amount of playing time?  For example, I have four players, and want a game that will go roughly six hours, using the one card=2 slots rule on the story arc.  How many villains/villain aspects?  How much does it matter in practice if aspects are spread across different villains or all on one sheet?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm running for the first time this Saturday, and want to do well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84987/#Comment_84987" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T10:42:43+00:00" title="August  2, 2007 10:42AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think of it this way: Does your villain have a plan of his own or is he working for someone else? If the villain has his own Plan, he gets his own sheet. If not, he's a Lieutenant aspect of the villain who's calling the shots.<br/><br/>My suggestion of three aspects was just based on my feel. There's no rule of thumb that I know of for the number of aspects a villain should get. However, I'm pretty sure Michael lays out how many different Plans (and thus villains) you should have based on the number of players. My book's at home, otherwise I'd find a page number for you. With four players, you probably want to have two Villains. Otherwise they'll probably take your villain down too quickly.<br/><br/>I think though, that the number of aspects you give your villain is probably the least important variable. More aspects just gives you more ways to spread out your Suffering in order to generate cards, without risking Devastation. But since the GM generally has no problem hitting his maximum hand size and more, especially at the beginning, it shouldn't be that big a deal either way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller" title="Kat Miller"><img alt="Kat Miller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.enter.net/~whim/picks/ittykat.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller">Kat Miller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85016/#Comment_85016" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T12:23:12+00:00" title="August  2, 2007 12:23PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) What Thor said: Hero cards go back to hero discard pile, villian cards go to villian discard pile.<br/><br/>2A &amp; <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> for a small group (3 players) I do one Villian scene per round of enrichments but for larger groups (4-5 players) I do  a villian scene every 3rd or 4th enrichment.  Its not really puppet theater since you can cast the players to play minions, leutenants or helpless victims.  Play up the opportunity for the players to set nasty counterstakes on the villians.<br/><br/>3)What Thor said.  Plus the new thing is to cap the highest card at ace (rather than ace+1) so that there are more opportunities for escalation.  <br/><br/>4) If there are multiple players in an enrichment scene, the director of that scene sets his stakes (and counterstakes) first and he and the GM play a card.  If the other players want to set stakes for that scene thats fine.  Taking turns, one at a time.  Each player sets stakes (and counterstakes) one at a time then plays agains the Gm.  <br/><br/>5) Devistated aspects are quite the thing,  Its a risk to let your aspect get devistated, as Thor said not only does it now generate cards for the GM as he makes that aspect suffer, but there the risk that the gm will transform it, and its a god risk.  To be honest, I only played in one full story arch game that I came close to reaching my master plan.  But there have been many games where I have been able to transform aspects.  <br/><br/>For the bonus Question: <br/>Mike and I can set you up our Demo pkg.  But if you'd rather build your own, Limit the Hero aspects to 3 or 4. <br/>Use the annual method of 2 spaces covered in the Story Arc per card played.  <br/><br/>Side Note:<br/>Cancelling.  Cancelling can make the game boring and frustrating if all thats done is to erase the action.  Instead of "No you don't" I mostly use the "yes, But-"  Taking their action idea and changing the end of it so that its not effective.  The mechanic is the same, but the feeling of play is different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller" title="Kat Miller"><img alt="Kat Miller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.enter.net/~whim/picks/ittykat.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller">Kat Miller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85025/#Comment_85025" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T12:44:45+00:00" title="August  2, 2007 12:44PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans</cite>Since Andy brought the subject, and risking being designated a thread hijacker, here is a question or two I have about WGP:<br/><br/>* Supervillain teams</blockquote>\nI often use Supervillian teams.

In short, before an Aspect is Devastated, nothing that happens can affect it for more than a scene. For example, a hero or supporting NPC might be kidnapped, but that just means he starts off his next scene in captivity, but can easily break out. He doesn't even need to make it part of his stakes in the new scene, unless he wants to.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce an Aspect is Devastated, the GM can change it in any fashion that will last to the end of the story--but no farther. These are the kidnappings that keep the girlfriend chained to the villain's throne in his secret headquarters until the big finale.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce an Aspect is Transformed or Redeemed, it must get changed in some way that will last into the next story. These are changes that stick around for a long time. Gwen Stacy dies. MJ marries Peter.
