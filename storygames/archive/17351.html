Here's the link: <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sandandsteam/one-shot-a-roleplaying-game-of-murder-and-vengeanc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sandandsteam/one-shot-a-roleplaying-game-of-murder-and-vengeanc</a><br/><br/>One Shot is a look at what you're willing to sacrifice to get vengeance on the person who ruined your life. You, the Shooter, have been given one shot, guaranteed to hit. The Forces (the GM-type role) gave you the shot and makes the material world bend to your will; money, resources, they're all yours. People however? They push back against you. And every Shooter must deal with the people closest to them in order to take their shot.<br/><br/>With there being just two players, the tension, the emotion, and the sacrifice have no one to diffuse them. It's close, personal, and messy. I'm really proud of my work with this game. I hope you'll take a look at it, and give a chance if you like what you see.<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/makrdp" title="makrdp"><img alt="makrdp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/makrdp">makrdp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393203/#Comment_393203" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-12T08:01:39+00:00" title="October 12, 2012  8:01AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Backed!

I'm pretty sure that even if I don't reach the anthology level, I'll be doing a separate Kickstarter for the anthology. I've gotten a lot of authors interested in submitting, and it's a neat topic to explore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TheOtherTracy" title="TheOtherTracy"><img alt="TheOtherTracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/711/nUY8JIY0C5ZHL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TheOtherTracy">TheOtherTracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394277/#Comment_394277" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T07:27:29+00:00" title="October 22, 2012  7:27AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've updated the campaign to include some samples of the soundtrack that now comes with the game for all backers $10, and higher. I think the music could really add to the experience.

I think the game experience is a very compelling one, and I hope that I'm able to produce it in the manner I think it deserves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
