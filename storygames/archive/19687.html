Interestingly, it's a very intuitive way of splitting the adjucating and adversarial halves of a traditional GM. The group adjucates, but only one member provides adversity.<br/><br/>I think the great bit about these games is the tension provided by having an unknown adversary. Plus the opportunity for sneakiness.<br/><br/>Actually, you've got me thinking along two different lines here. One is a traditional "traitor" game, but the other is Coup-inspired, where you have access to a limited slice of the authority pie, but can claim any authority you wish, until someone calls you out on it.<br/><br/>Just need to find a good narrative fit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437366/#Comment_437366" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-15T15:00:05+00:00" title="August 15, 2014  3:00PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, a fantastic idea. Some kind "heist movie"-type setup, with an Agent infiltrating the group, could work well, although something a little more esoteric would be more interesting.<br/><br/>The problem lies in how to hide generating *fictional* adversity. <br/><br/>The way I would go about this (sadly, don't have the time to do full-on design at the moment) would be to create a setup where every player benefits from the creation of fictional adversity, the more the better. (Danger dice in Danger Patrol are a simple example of such a mechanic, although even the desire to score XP from the group in D&amp;D could work with a lot massaging.)<br/><br/>However, certain players have a vested interest in things getting thoroughly screwed up and the other PCs getting killed. Their roles are hidden.<br/><br/>Resolution in this game includes some kind of hidden input from every player, so we can never know for sure why certain conflicts/events are failures and others are not.<br/><br/><i>Capes</i> (RPG) and <i>The Resistance</i> (boardgame) would both be good reading for this subject.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437367/#Comment_437367" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-15T15:19:44+00:00" title="August 15, 2014  3:19PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I'm as intrigued as the others here about hiding the antagonist amongst the players (a common murder mystery game arrangement), I didn't necessarily hear that in the OP.

Any system to some extent is lightly antagonist.  Sure rules and play materials can function as antagonism, but having a person along with that makes it smarter.  Pandemic is just a tough game(to win), not a smart game.  It doesn't really adapt like a person would.  If Pandemic had a Carrier role, it might make a better game?  Certainly different.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/maracanda" title="maracanda"><img alt="maracanda" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/236/nYDJK66XVHRHJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/maracanda">maracanda</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437397/#Comment_437397" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-16T07:12:45+00:00" title="August 16, 2014  7:12AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2014 7:13AM by maracanda.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doesn't <i>Paranoia </i>do this as well?

I think it would be pretty easy to do this for one-shot play in much the same fashion as how similar board/card games handle it: Everyone secretly views a card indicating whether they're loyal or a traitor (and perhaps, as in Shadow Over Camelot, there a players+1 cards so there's always the possibility that no one is actually the traitor). The tricky thing would be how you'd handle scenes in which the traitor does traitorous things without giving away which player is in control of that character. I feel like that would be most easily facilitated by online play (or even people in a room together with chat programs and laptops), where back-channel communication between the traitor and GM allows the GM to describe what's going on without letting you "see the face" of the traitor.<br/><br/>For longer play, I think it would be really interesting to develop a system that could recreate the popular narrative trope of the traitor unexpectedly warming up to the "good guy" enemies, and facing a crisis of conscience. You could always just leave that decision in the player's hands, of course, but some kind of encouragement or reflection of this choice in the rules would sweeten the pot for a lot of players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437417/#Comment_437417" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-16T13:50:17+00:00" title="August 16, 2014  1:50PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><a href="http://groundhoggth.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/the-thought-police.html" rel="nofollow">The Thought Police</a></b> was a conscious effort on my part to port some of the mechanics of games like <i>Werewolf</i> and <i>Are You The Traitor?</i> into a storygame, so I think it could easily be done in a more antagonistic way.

Any player who doesn't fulfill both victory conditions loses the game. Very interesting mechanism: everyone has needs, so any player who wants to win needs to satisfy their own needs as well as the needs of the group.<br/>2: lots of hidden information. You gain cards, and don't show anybody. (Like in Battlestar Galactica.) These cards help the group. And if you put the wrong cards in the pool that the group uses to defeat crises, bad things happen. (Naturally, you play facedown, and shuffle the resource cards before checking against the crisis.) Also like BSG. (Basically, everyone gets a chance to throw cards in, then you check to see if you met the requirements.)<br/>3: interlocking mechanisms. There's a few different threat meters and loss conditions, and various things that interact. A more sophisticated system means that you have more opportunities for a traitor to gum up the works undetected.<br/><br/>So stuff can be learned from that.<br/><br/>~~~<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I have some thoughts that could make for a simple game.<br/><br/>Every player draws an Objective card, and the group has a Goal. This would work great for a heist game where everyone is part of a ragtag team with self-serving needs. Then, the players draw Heist cards. Heist cards have "hard moves" (like in Apocalypse World) printed on one half. The other half has player moves.<br/><br/>You start with a player, who flips over a Danger card. It describes what happens, and people work out what that means: who's in danger, and what sort of danger it is. This is probably linked to everyone's location (maybe there's a sort of map players move around?). Anyone who's in danger needs to play a player move or else face a hard move from someone's hand.<br/><br/>Since hard moves could do anything from "injure" to "split off from the group" to "take equipment", any given player has a lot of leeway when they're assigning hard moves. And some are more severe than others. Also, a hard move has to get played from someone's hand.<br/><br/>With me so far? Is this all just confusing?<br/><br/>So let's say that a player has these cards...<br/><br/>"Injure a crew member" / "Sneak past guards"<br/>"Set off an alarm" / "Wait out the searching"<br/>"Split a group" / "Disable security"<br/>"Suspicious guards investigate" / "Find an easy way in"<br/><br/>If they play "Injure a crew member" as a response to another player who can't play a card in response to their Danger (maybe they don't have a matching card, maybe they want to save it for later, maybe they want to screw someone over with the hard move on it), they might claim that it was the least-bad card in their hand. Or that none of the others fit very well.<br/><br/>And you keep running it like that, with players playing cards in response to Dangers and getting screwed over by one another (or not, as it happens), until they finish their Goal (and achieve their Objectives) or utterly fail.<br/><br/>So it's like a typical semi-cooperative game, but replacing the number-ish mechanics with fictional positioning and narrative-based mechanics.<br/><br/>I should probably explain this when it's not almost midnight here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437436/#Comment_437436" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-17T12:30:11+00:00" title="August 17, 2014 12:30PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><b><a href="http://groundhoggth.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/the-thought-police.html" rel="nofollow">The Thought Police</a></b> was a conscious effort on my part to port some of the mechanics of games like <i>Werewolf</i> and <i>Are You The Traitor?</i> into a storygame, so I think it could easily be done in a more antagonistic way.
