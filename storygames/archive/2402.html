                    Over on Sin Aesthetics, I posted <a href="http://games.spaceanddeath.com/sin_aesthetics/55" rel="nofollow">My Gaming Census</a> which gives a demographic profile of the people I play with and the games we play. I'm interested in other people's gaming census data, so thought I'd nudge folks on SG to post them here, or at SA or back at your home blog.                </div>

                            Doing that for SGBoston will be tough, but maybe I can team up with Dev and Nathan and we can run a little informal survey at the next meeting.  A lot of our answers are going to be similar to yours, but some of them are rather different, since we're a slightly younger crew (a couple years out of college) of people who had no real relationship 6 months ago and we've been playing one-shots every week for the best 4-5 months.                        </div>

                            Ok, I'll give it a crack. I have two real life gaming groups but I'll lump them altogether for the sake of the census. I've been playing with one group for 4 years, the other for only 18 months.<br/><br/>Life:<br/><br/>There are 11 guys and gals who I game with regularly (once every 1-2 weeks face to face), plus me.<br/>10 are men (including me), 2 are women.<br/>7 of us are 20-25, 2 of us 26-30 and the remainder 30+<br/>All are white. Ethnicities are mainly English, but also Irish and Greek Cypriot.<br/>I'm not sure about socio, religious, economic or political backgrounds. If I had to hazard a guess I'd think most are left-leaning folks. And we're mostly middle-class for added fun.<br/>5 of us are involved in IT, 1 in finance and the rest are students.<br/>None of us are married, although 4 are in relationships (2 with other members of the group!).<br/>5 of us have undergrad degrees, the remainder are all currently studying for one.<br/>1 of the 11 is my brother, 1 is an ex-housemate of mine, 3 are housemates together, 2 are old school friends of each other, the rest we know through gaming. We're all good friends beyond the gaming table.<br/><br/>Notable Experience:<br/><br/>Four of the group are artists, 2 animation artists, 2 filmmakers.<br/>At least two are musical.<br/>Two of us have been paid as published writers.<br/><br/>Gaming:<br/><br/>4 of us have GMd games in which I've been involved.<br/>1 of us is new to gaming in the past 5 years, 4 of us new to gaming in the past year. The rest have been gaming for 10+ years.<br/>5 of us have played around with new fangled hippy games, the rest regularly play them.<br/>5 of us came out of wargaming, none out of boardgaming, 2 out of computer gaming.<br/>1 was heavily into MMORPGs but has recently returned to the land of the real life gamer.<br/>1 has extensive MU** experience.<br/>3 of us spend a fair amount of time on gaming forums and blogs, and 1 even moderates a games related forum.<br/><br/>On the games:<br/><br/>The games I've played in the past 4 years with these folks: Dead of Night, Unknown Armies, Iron Kingdoms, Mutants &amp; Masterminds, Delta Green (3 games), Burning Empires, WFRP (3 games), Savage Worlds, Earthdawn, Spirit of the Century, Trinity, My Life with Master and Growing Pains.<br/>WFRP, Trinity and Delta Green represent the majority of my gaming time.<br/>Most of the games lasted 4-6 weeks. Trinity lasted 3 months, WFRP 6 months and both Earthdawn and Spirit of the Century are new but ongoing.<br/>None of these games were based on pre-written adventures.<br/><br/>EDIT: I also have an online group, made up of friends from uni, but for the sake of brevity I've discounted it here.                        </div>

                            I'll lump my three groups together as well.<br/><br/>17 gamers total.<br/>15 male.<br/>2 female.<br/>2 married couples in the groups.<br/>100% hetero, as far as I'm aware.<br/>Only 3 people are not married; two are single (one in a committed relationship, one not), one is recently divorced.<br/><br/>All are between 30-40 years in age, tending toward 35+.<br/>Middle to upper-middle class economically.<br/>9 are employed in some realm of IT.<br/>4 have theater experience.<br/>All but 1 have somewhere around 20+ years of gaming under their belt.<br/><br/>All of us are "white"; I'm half-Punjabi, and comprise pretty much all of the "color" in the groups. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>All of us are Christian, Pagan, or agnostic/atheist.<br/>I believe everyone has at least an undergraduate degree; a few have master's.<br/>Most everyone grew up near a city of significant size.<br/>Politically, the majority are typical Democrats, with a few Republicans and 1-2 self-identified Libertarians.<br/><br/>About 7 had extensive friendships or relationships with each other prior to the formation of the groups.<br/><br/>4 are regular GMs, 2 others are occasional GMs.<br/>0 have any experience with hippy games, other than what I've attempted to force upon them. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>5 probably enjoy tactical/strategy games (e.g., <i>Axis &amp; Allies</i>, M:tG) as much, or more, than they do TRPGs.<br/>6 enjoy CRPG/MMORPGs as much or more than they do TRPGs.<br/>4 participate in online RPG forums on a regular basis, but none more than myself, by a wide margin.<br/><br/>The games we've played, in toto and order of frequency (most to least): D&amp;D and HERO consistently; SWd20 and M&amp;M1e 2-3 sessions each; d20M, IH, <i>Buffy</i>, BW, and BE were all one-shots. <i>Serenity</i> is going to start in a few weeks.<br/><br/>One D&amp;D campaign has been playing consistently, every session, for going on four years. One HERO campaign has been playing mostly consistently for going on four years, another for 1-2. Other D&amp;D and HERO games have been sporadic. Any and all other systems were one-shots or campaigns that died after 2-3 sessions.<br/><br/>The two long-running games were homebrewed. The sporadic campaigns are a mix of homebrew and published adventures.<br/><br/>The long-running D&amp;D game has been tactically-focused, though an overarching goal emerged after a few years of play, and the whole game is now building to the completion of that goal.<br/><br/>The long-running HERO game has been a sprawling Marvel-like ongoing story, with many plot points surfacing over the years, and no end goal in sight.<br/><br/>The D&amp;D games (and some of the d20 one-shots) have been heavily emphasized on fighty miniatures play. There is no emphasis on character or story.<br/><br/>The HERO games have had heavy emphasis on character and story, with little emphasis on fighty miniatures play.<br/><br/>None of the games, afaict, have ever been adapted to fit the social contract. They are what they are, and you like 'em or you don't.                        </div>

                            Here's my two regular gaming groups. I could do another one on the "player pool" I have - a 50 or so people whom I can draw into one-shots or campaigns and whom I LARP with, but numbers with them would be really rough estimates. <br/><br/>People:<br/><br/>7 players<br/>5 male, 2 female<br/>Ages:<br/>28-30 3<br/>30-33 4 (me)<br/><br/>2 players married, with children (including me) - 2 others in stable relationship (together)<br/>I'm not very aware of the sexual side, but I'm guessing that two have bi-sexual experiences.<br/>All white caucasian, six Finns, one Finn-Swede.<br/>All atheist (two might be habitual lutherians, I don't really know)<br/><br/>3 working in IT sector (incl. me), one completing her doctoral studies, one has recently been admitted to dramaturgy studies, two doing translation &amp; publishing work. 5 out of 7 have written for roleplaying and computer gaming magazines both. <br/>Three have done university studies, three have bachelor's degrees, one high school graduate.<br/>Five come from capital area, one from other large city, one from mid-sized city/countryside.

                            Can I get away with just saying that I play a lot? FTF, and online with people from all over the world? To say nothing of convention play, which I get a lot of? Sometimes with people I've just met, other times with friends that I have from all over the US and beyond?<br/>
<br/>
I'd say it's possible that I've played with more than 100 different people in the last year alone. I'd say that they're mostly white, mostly male, mostly from the US. Which is probably unsurprising and unhelpful.<br/>

P.S. Mostly Hero Quest for game system, but around 20 others or so at a guess.                        </div>

                            Mike, <br><br>Believe it or don't, that actually is useful. The one thing I'd ask for more detail about is how those 100 people break down in terms of how you've played with them. How many were at cons, how many online, how many in one shots, how many in ongoing games? <br><br>Rough guesses are fine, I'd just like to get a picture here of trends rather than hard data points.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Here's the census for my Tuesday RPG regulars:<br><br>Life:<br/><br/>* 7 players.<br/>* 6 are male, 1 is female.<br/>* Ages are all early to mid-30's.<br/>* All are white.<br/>* All are middle class.<br/>* 6 are married (one pair to each other).  The last is in a long-term relationship.  Two of the men have children.<br/>* Religion isn't something we discuss often.  I don't think any are particularly devout.  I think at least a few consider themselves agnostic or atheists.<br/>* Politically I think it's mostly a range between moderate left and right-leaning libertarian.  One describes himself as an anarchist.<br/>* All work in IT (support, administrators, programmers).<br/><br/>Gaming:<br/><br/>* 4 have GM'ed games in which I played.<br/>* I think I'm the only one with LARP experience, and that was only once.<br/>* All have PnP experience going back years.<br/>* All play boardgames.<br/>* All but me have been playing WoW since it started (I quit after 9 months, the rest lasted longer and then resumed when the expansion was released).  Most have played other MMORPGs as well.<br/>* I believe only 3 or 4 have online MU* experience.<br/>* Only 2 read online RPG forums that I know of, only I post regularly as far as I know.<br/><br/>On the games:<br/><br/>* Games we've played: Mutants &amp; Masterminds 1E (4 episodes), Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3E (3 episodes), All Flesh Must Be Eaten (3 episodes), Buffy: the Vampire Slayer (1 episode), Heavy Gear (1 episode), Paranoia (1 episode), GURPS Traveller (1 episode), Jovian Chronicles (1 episode), Universalis (1 episode)<br/>* Of those games, M&amp;M, D&amp;D, Buffy, Paranoia, Traveller, and possibly JC and HG were conceived as campaigns.  The AFMBE games were designed and played as one-shots, as was Universalis (a game about Jacques Cousteau and his time travelling whale).<br/>* Most episodes ran from 2 to 5 sessions, including the AFMBE one-shots.  Universalis ran one night.<br/>* The typical session lasted around 2.5 hours.<br/>* 2 of the D&amp;D episodes were pre-written modules (Sunless Citadel and Forge of Fury), as was the Heavy Gear episode.                        </br></br></div>

                            I'd be hard pressed to list the people I play with online; I don't even know many of their ages. Some of them, I'm not sure what their gender is. But let's take the example of our nadan group, playing chat-based in a Chel'qhur-inspired tribe on a roughly weekly basis (with several small group scenes in between that involve 2 to 4 of the characters), I get 3 male/4 female players, late teens to 40s, at least one African-American with the rest probably Caucasian, two married couples and three non-married players, with professions that include homemaker, student, office worker, IT, and craftsperson. Most of the players have never played table-top RPGs, with me being the big exception. I don't think anyone but me plays MMORPGs either (GuildWars FTW!).  And we don't play published rules systems together, just your standard freeform or GM'ed chat play.                        </div>

                            Christian, <br/><br/>Yea, that's one of the reasons that when Mo was doing the census I didn't kick in all the people we play online with. It was just TT. I've thought about doing another one for online, but I'm not sure how accurate I could be in it. (More girls than boys, more games that are either very short run plot based or long and meandering life-based, more geographic diversity... other than that....)<br/><br/>However, would you say that most of your gaming happens online? And do you think that effects the way you approach game and the types of things you want game to do?                        </div>

                            My datapoint should sit right on the median, i'd imagine. <br/><br/>My sample here is the core of the group i began rpging with in highschool, and although all of us have played regularly with other groups since (including my only traditional "campaign" game) i have continued to game with them off-and-on to the present day. (I think everyone else we gamed with in HS has quit tt-gaming.) We seem to have adapted regularly &amp; readily to new developments in gaming, including adopting d20, and are currently playing Burning Wheel &amp; Iron Heroes.<br/><br/>So, stats:<br/><br/>- 5 players, all male, ages 19-25, all americans of ~ western european extraction, upper middle class, all roughly single &amp; probably straight<br/>- all students (2 chemistry, 1 computer security, 1 linguistics, 1 biology), although i already hold a BS degree<br/>- religion: 3 atheist or agnostic, 1 unknown, 1 fairly devout christian<br/>- politics: i'd say left &amp; anti-authoritarian leaning over all, but with lots of specific &amp; pragmatic variation; i'm probably the most "liberal", with respect for Green, Libertarian, &amp; Socialist ideology<br/>- as for art, we've all dabbled with bad genre fiction - not so bad at all in one case - and two are quite good at online comic art, but son't have regular strips (yet)<br/><br/>gaming:<br/><br/>- all but 1 have GM'd various games we've played together (and i'd say that one is the best role-player of the group)<br/>- i've larped, once or twice, but i don't think anyone else has<br/>- we all started playing RPGs, CCDs, &amp; Warhammer together, and we all readily play various boardgames (cosmic encounter &amp; risk, especially)<br/>- we've all (except one?) played MMPOGs - Ragnarok, Final Fantasy, Anarchy Online, Ryzome, Guild Wars, WoW - and two are still WoW fanatics; (while I've pretty much given up on MMPOGs)<br/>- i think only i hang out on online gaming forums!<br/><br/>games:<br/><br/>- in chrono order: AD&amp;D, GURPS, Storyteller, more GURPS, D&amp;D3e, more GURPS, more D&amp;D3e, Exalted, Hunter (hacked with forgey goodness), Burning Wheel, Iron Heroes<br/>- we've done deliberate one-shots, mini-campaigns, tpk scenarios, and several attempts at campaigns that fizzled, but never a long term game; our most common theme is three-session games<br/>- typical sessions are intense: 5 hours or longer, fri, sat, sunday affairs<br/>- we've only used pre-written modules for our beginning AD&amp;D games, but did do a loose interpretation of Luke's "Sword" BW demo last year                        </div>

I'd been considering going and volunteering to do a program at my local Y. That's really cool.

                            Brand,<br/><br/>Yes and yes.<br/><br/>In more words than that, there are two main reasons I play mostly in chat-based games.  First, it's easy to drop into the forum and start a scene with another player or two.  Second, and more importantly, it's how I play with Lisa.<br/><br/>As for the second question, I have yet to finish any designs for chat interfaces, though I've been thinking about that a lot.  I do think that Beast Hunters, for example, is influenced by the way combat is done in those environments: by persuading the other person with creativity and coolness to take hits.<br/><br/>Now, "real life" group info: my last AD&amp;D 2e group was all male, I was the youngest with the other players in their early 30s, consisting of three people in the law field (judge, attorney, paralegal) and one community college English teacher.  That group's probably more representative of many other groups out there <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            From my regular group + HolmCon (yearly con, my house), a total of 19 people:<br/>
<br/>
Gender: 13 m, 6 f<br/>
Age: 19-45, most in their mid-twenties<br/>
Ethnicity: 18 white, 1 "mixed" (for lack of a better word)<br/>
Nationality: Norwegian, whaddayaknow.<br/>
Married: 5, all with children<br/>
Religion: I have no idea. Norway is pretty secular, and a <i>lot</i> of people are semi-christian, in that they go to church occasionally, but it's not a huge part of their life. I know 2 or 3 of the crowd are, or have been, atheists. No muslims, buddhists, wiccans, catholics, mormons or jews that I know of.<br/>
Politics: Most would lean left of center, though a few are right-wing. (Compared to US standards, we're all pretty far left, I believe).<br/>
Work etc: I dont' know for everyone, but from what I know...<br/>
[ulist]<br/>
* 2 work in IT<br/>
* 3 work with people (school psych councellor, addict work, teacher)<br/>
* 1 journalist<br/>
* 1 human rights (or similar)<br/>
* 1.5 writer<br/>
* 5 students (nordic languages, technical, psychology, 2 unknown)<br/>
* 1 fan organization employee.<br/>

And gamer data, do the folks in your group do other related things like PBEM, MMORPGS, MU**, LARP, Console Gaming?                        </br></br></div>

                            From my two regular groups, six and three people (I'm in both, so 8 total).  <br><b><br>Gender: </br></b>8 male<br><b>Age: </b>Late twenties to late thirties<br><b>Ethnicity: </b> We're all white dudes but one is a Goth, does that count?<br><b>Married/committed: </b>6, no children<br><b>Religion: </b>Two are semi-religious but this isn't something we ever discuss.<br><b>Politics: </b>I think we're all American left, but see religion - not really a topic.<br><b>Work: </b> 5 work in IT, 1 is a student, 1 in publishing, 1 is unemployed<br><b>Education: </b> Ranges from "some college" to multiple Masters degrees.  We had two PhDs but we lost 'em recently. <br><b>Skillz: </b> 1 does art and art direction, 2 have theater backgrounds, 3 are musicians, 2 are game designers. I'm sure I forgot some stuff because we are all spectacular.  <br><br><b>Games:  </b>One group has played only long-term TSoY (in various home-made flavors) in the last year.  The other group runs through games for 3-5 sessions each:  PTA, Sorcerer, Heroquest, FLFS, Galactic, TSoY, Mortal Coil, AG&amp;G, Heroes Banner, Elfs, Cold City, and so forth.  <br><br>Of the 8, 3 other than me also have other gaming groups, playing D&amp;D 3.5 and Savage Worlds I believe.

                            John, that is some impressive *lot* of data, and great to see a somewhat more diverse crowd. Is that diversity consistent through all of your seven groups or do demographic similarities tend to clump ( is there older and younger groups, more racially diverse groups and less etc. or is everybody kind of a mix among all of the groups? Similarly, do find that game style, length, duration and intensity varies by group, or is your gaming consistent across the board?<br><br>Also, I'm curious, did you actually poll, or did you know it all off the top of your head?                        </br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mo</cite>Is that diversity consistent through all of your seven groups or do demographic similarities tend to clump ( is there older and younger groups, more racially diverse groups and less etc. or is everybody kind of a mix among all of the groups? </blockquote>
The answers to your questions correlate directly to how the players met each other. The players who met through school (mostly high school), family, and work tend to be much less diverse (all white, all male, employed in arts or IT, all from NY). Players who've met online and at conventions tend to be extremely diverse. And friends brought in from the merging of all these groups tend to be in the middle ground of diversity. Players from NYC, Boston, and Buffalo seem to also be very similar. 
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mo</cite>Similarly, do find that game style, length, duration and intensity varies by group, or is your gaming consistent across the board? </blockquote>
Game style, length, duration, and intensity seem to correlate directly to age, marital status, children, and job responsibilities. Although this is all mixed up across multiple groups. 
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mo</cite>Also, I'm curious, did you actually poll, or did you know it all off the top of your head?</blockquote>
Partial poll for this specific survey. I performed several searches on <a href="http://www.nerdnyc.com" rel="nofollow">nerdnyc.com</a> looking for past threads where we've polled many of the players on ethnicity, sex, religion, politics and more. I also know most of the players intimately, some I've know for 14+ years, I've lived with some, some have worked for me, I've helped many with accounting/taxes/finding jobs/finding apartments, and I've helped organize many of the groups and introduced many of the people to each other or met them at conventions and brought them into other groups. So I'm pretty familiar with the majority of those involved. I would say the following are probably somewhat off: Politics (economic), Religion (between Atheist and Agnostic), and Income (many people have been layed off, quit or have had raises in the last 1-2 years since I've had these conversations with them).                        </div>

                            Brand, I couldn't hazard. Just looking at the SW Wiki there have been 26 people who have played in the past year alone (if I go back to when you played, it's more like 40). Some of who I didn't recall having played until I read the wiki. Part of the problem is that these folks are of varying regularity. Some play every week. Some play off and on. I just had a player return to play on Monday who we'd not seen for a couple of months. Occasionally somebody like JB will drop in - and he first played in the original demo for the game 4 years ago, and has only played like 3 times since.<br/>
<br/>
Also, many of the people in my online game, or who I played with at the conventions, are the folks here and from the Forge (of the 26 people on the Wiki, half are posters here). We don't want to be recounting anybody, do we? Or doesn't that matter? How many people I've played with that nobody else here has played with in the last year? Got no idea.<br/>
<br/>
Just to give an idea of how little I'm aware of all of who I've played with, it's quite possible that I played a game with Andy in the last year. ForgeCon, GenCon... Couldn't say for sure, tho. In fact I can't absolutely recall ever playing a game with Andy. Though I think it's unlikely that we haven't at least been in a demo together. Not because Andy is unmemorable. Simply because I have a crummy memory for things like that.<br/>

                            Ok, I'll give it a whirl:<br><br>- There are 20 people, roughly comprising three groups (with some crossover) that I've gamed with in the last year, including me.<br>- 13 are men<br>- 7 are women <br>- Ages range from 26 to 40, with the biggest cluster around 30-32 -- I don't know everyone's specific age, so I can't do an average<br>- 19 are some permutation of white, one is black<br>- I know that 10 of us identify to some extent as "queer" or gay; it wouldn't surprise me to learn the number was higher.<br>- Historically, we're clustered around the lower and middle range of middle class; many of us are students or non-profit workers, which puts us in the lower middle class at the moment.<br>- Religion-wise, at least five of us are culturally Jewish, and I know we have at least two practicing pagans.  At least two of us have a religious fundamentalist background, and now identify as agnostic or atheist.<br>- There are five couples who game together, so half of us are in committed relationships and game with our partners.  13 total are in committed relationships.<br>- The majority have at least undergraduate degrees, several of us are doctoral students or hold graduate degrees.<br/>- All of us are politically left of center; several have socialist or anarchist leanings.<br/>- I was friends with 11 of the folks prior to gaming with them, and we all socialize outside of gaming contexts.<br/><br/>- 5 have GM'd games in which I was or am involved (4 men and me)<br/>- 5 of us, including myself, are relatively new to gaming, having started in the last year.<br/>- All of us have experience with indie games of one stripe or another.<br/>- The games I've played in the past year with these folks: The Shadow of Yesterday (2 different games with two completely discrete groups), The Mountain Witch (1 game), Corvus's homebrew game, and in the near future we'll be playing Dark Ages Vampire.  All of these were/are relatively long-run games of several months, with the exception of The Mountain Witch, which was completed in 4 sessions.  We all tend toward what could be termed Narrativist play.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            This thread makes me wonder how much we really know about the people in our groups. I'm in one of Jason's groups, and I'm trying to figure out which slots I'm in.<br/><br/>I have two groups, one weekly and one bi-weekly, with a total of 8 people. We're all Caucasian males.<br/><br/><b>Married:</b> Four that I know of, three I don't know, and 1 in a long-term relationship.<br/><br/><b>Straight-i-tude:</b> All publicly identify as straight as far as I know.<br/><br/><b>Religious:</b> Well, I'm a Unitarian, with strong liberal Christian leanings. The rest, I don't know a lot about, except one is at least kind of Buddhist and another I would guess has a Christian background.<br/><br/><b>Politics:</b> Again, I don't know, but I would guess 5 very liberal, 3 moderate.<br/><br/><b>Jobs:</b> Most of us are technical. One is in financial stuff.<br/><br/><b>Education:</b> I can't believe I don't know. I think everyone but me has degrees, and I'm in college. (as an adult learner.)<br/><br/><b>Age:</b> All of us are 30 to 40, I think.<br/><br/><b>Games we play:</b> One group is the assorted group - see Jason's post. We play everything. The other one is in a mid-to-long term Unisystem game in the world of Fallout.<br/><br/>One group is friends outside of gaming; the other group is, too, I think, but not with me. I'm new to the group. The first group are (watch me embarrass myself) my closest friends in the area. We've met each other's parents and wives and pets and know all their names.<br/><br/>If Jason didn't count me as a musician, I am disappointed!<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>Over time, my data's more interesting. Out of the last 17 people I gamed with regularly, one was female. One was Asian and the rest were Caucasian. Most were agnostic or atheist, with a smattering of neo-pagans (1) and liberal Christians (2) and Buddhist (2).                        </div>

Too true.  Even with my weekly group, comprised of my closest friends, there were several details I only had to guess at.  I didn't even bother trying to do a census for the bi-weekly group because there's so much I just don't know about them.  They're great guys and I'd like to think we've become friends over the time we've been playing, however we haven't gotten together outside of gaming.                        </div>

                            Mo,<br/><br/>I did! I've moved a lot, actually, which is one reason I don't know my game groups as well as some people do. My groups in Seattle and New Orleans were together longer, though, so I got to know them even better.<br/><br/>As a side note, this is an odd thread, because my local players read SG. Anyway, to talk about them more: Jason mentioned that we don't discuss politics or religion. That's true, but strikes me as weird: I enjoy my time with that particular group outside of gaming, as much, if not moreso, than when we are gaming. I'm not sure why we have certain lines, but it's interesting.<br/><br/>I am definitely looking forward to having another group like my Seattle groups: that is, a group of primarily friends that also play hard. I remember going out for beers with those guys and <i>talking</i> - expressing reality about problems at home, or in my heart, or whatever. Those groups take a lot of time, though.                        </div>

                            Clinton, <br/><br/>Good point. I've been friends with all my current group, save 1, since I came to Toronto. Some I knew online before that. Mo's been friends with most of them for at least 8 years, and sometimes upwards of 13. <br/><br/>Which is interesting in terms of Matt's comments in the other thread about people moving and turning to the net for connections and their games.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton R. Nixon</cite>This thread makes me wonder how much we really know about the people in our groups.</blockquote>
I wonder if that depends on how you got involved in the group. I mean, with my online group I went to uni with those guys, so I know pretty much everything about them. But my current rl group I found through a messageboard and although we're now friends beyond the game, I don't know a whole lot about them because we mainly talk about gaming.<br/><br/>Which begs the question I guess - how much do you have to do with your gaming group beyond the gaming table?                        </div>

                            I have at any given time 4-8 regulars, depending on the games I am currently running. These people come from a pool of maybe 50 or so (which overlaps Merten's pool significantly, I suspect). Right now there's 8 (including your truely).<br/><br/>Life:<br/>- Age late twenties to early thirties.<br/>- Nationality and native language: Finnish.<br/>- Married with children: 1.<br/>- Living together with significant other: 5.<br/>- Atheist or as practically atheist: 8. (I am not aware of anyone being devotional.)<br/>- Politics: generally greenish left liberal.<br/>- Men: 6.<br/>- Women: 2.<br/>- Sexuality: While the norm is heterosexual, bi- and homosexuality is also represented, and BDSM inclinations are not exactly rare. (This refers to the pool of 50, not to current group.)<br/>- Jobs: plenty of IT people, several people in academia (both humanities and hard sciences), some journalists, some artists/writers, some retail, some odd jobs. (Referring to the whole pool.)<br/>- Education: Pretty much everyone is at least an undergraduate, several graduates, a few doctorates. (Referring to the whole pool.)<br/>- Several people in the pool hang out outside gaming, but this has varied greatly over the years.<br/>- Almost all live in an urban area.<br/><br/>Gamewise it depends how you split it: only games I currently run or play in are a homebrew, Earthdawn, Call of Cthulhu, and Warhammer FRP. If you count games that have made appearances over the years, or games that other people run -- the list pretty much explodes.<br/><br/>Almost everyone in the pool has played more then one game, most have 10+ years of gaming, several have 20+. Most have played in several LARPs, some have written and organized LARPs. Several play MMORPGs. Most play boardgames irregularly.                        </div>

<blockquote><br/>Which begs the question I guess - how much do you have to do with your gaming group beyond the gaming table?</blockquote>
before I moved 2200 some miles away from my gaming group, we did family things together, holidays, birthdays, dinner, coffee, shopping, weddings, best men in each others weddings, that level of 20 plus years of friendship. <br/>Since moving I dont have a gaming group locally, but I consider my annual trips back up north to consist of my gaming, where over a 10 day trip get in several late nights of gaming, catch up with kids and who grades are going, go out to eat, do coffee, sit and chat while they are working from home, etc. Things long time friends do, in addition to Board, Card, Scrabble, RPG, Computer games as well.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tadk</cite>Which begs the question I guess - how much do you have to do with your gaming group beyond the gaming table?</blockquote>
Clinton, I <i>totally </i>counted you as a musician!<br/><br/>Not to be a boaster, but watch me boast - Tuesday we all got together - with our spouses and GFs, along with Andy K and his wife Orie - and took Blake, a cool guy I met at Dreamation who was in town for work, out to our favorite Korean restaurant for a family-style dinner.  There was nerd talk (Nerdly talk, anyway), but also house talk, cat talk, and so forth.  <br/><br/>Amusing anecdote - in my other, long-time gaming group we're all friends in and out of gaming, but there's this one guy who's a little .... <i>mysterious.</i>  He doesn't talk about himself much, and we've always, always just given him plenty of space and never asked any questions (even though we game at his house!).  One time we all went to a drive-in, and my wife Autumn rode with him on the way.  In a twenty minute car ride, she learned more about him by asking friendly questions then we'd learned in five years.                        </div>
