But did I think instantly of D&amp;D alignments? Well ok, yes I did, but then I thought Hang on, there\u2019s a game in there somewhere. Ok, but what kind of game? No-brainer, a game about ever so slightly incompetent trainee demons of course. It\u2019s also by way of being a dig at the \u2018D&amp;D turns harmless teenagers into psychopathic killers\u2019 school of journalism. <br/><br/>Lest I get whacked by the same stick, I\u2019ve made clear in the rules that the characters can only do very low-level evil, and that the GM should explicitly steer players away from disturbing themes. Not sure that\u2019ll be enough to ward off potential criticism however. I haven\u2019t got a system yet, but tbh if folks say \u2018Don\u2019t do it, it\u2019s pants\u2019 I won\u2019t bother.

Wait till you've read it though: you might think it's pants after all <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=":wink:"/>.\n<blockquote>This game sort of reminds me of a "safe for work" version of Kill Puppies for Satan, albeit with quite different sounding rules (although without the actual rules it's hard to say by how much), at least in that the players are out to cause trouble, but the real evil is reserved for the higher ups.</blockquote>Yeah, that\u2019s pretty much the size of it. I think there\u2019s a lot of mileage to be had from a game about comic evil, but without the death threats (of which VB has apparently had a fair few due to KPfS). Rules I\u2019m still working on, but it\u2019s going to be very heavily PvP, with the GM playing the characters off against each other. PCs gain at the end through completed missions and in so doing win favour with the Boss, so there\u2019s an incentive for them to try to derail each other\u2019s missions. This they do by paying to be in a scene and using their own powers to deflect those of their rivals.\n<blockquote>I also find it somewhat hilarious that a game called "Chaotic Evil" restricts the characters to acts that I would not blink an eye at seeing Chaotic *Good* characters in D&amp;D perform, let alone some of the truly heinous acts I've seen supposedly Chaotic Neutral players perform over the years. </blockquote>Well, the whole thing\u2019s a bit of a joke really. I\u2019m playing on the two meanings of Chaotic Evil: in D&amp;D an unremittingly monstrous alignment, and in general usage bumbling and inept. I\u2019ve also got an idea for a WWII-themed espionage game, provisionally entitled Teatime For Hitler, that plays on the idea of well-intentioned but incompetent, stiff upper-lipped British secret agents (think the spies in \u2018Allo \u2018Allo- \u2018Good moaning\u2019 etc.).  \n<blockquote>I'd thought it would be more a mix of paranoia XP and I Kill Puppies for Satan but with more D&amp;D crunch.</blockquote>Now this is interesting. As D&amp;D features in the game*, I thought it would be a good idea to make it reasonably crunchy, so I could subtitle it something like <i>trad rules: indy spirit</i>. In keeping with the theme of bungling ineptness, I\u2019m toying with the idea of having negative, rather than positive stats. Frx, you have average stats in all your basic skills, but would also have an Ineptness stat which would come off your roll, which could however be modded by various traits and triggers accruing to your human form, so if you were playing a hard-drinking construction worker you could get a bonus when you used STR, or in a scene in a bar. Alternatively, <i>all</i> your stats could be minus numbers, and the TN would be say half d+1 (i.e. 6 off a d10, 7 off a d12, 11 off a d20 etc.) the more missions you complete the higher the hedrality you can use. You can spend MP (Mwa-ha-ha Points- yes, I know, <i>very</i> close to the Evil Points of KPfS- will work on differentiating) to buff your stat, or a ton of them to guarantee success. The scene would then go from being PC&gt;NPC to PC&gt;PC, potentially cutting the NPCs out of the action entirely. <br/><br/>I\u2019ve got an idea for char gen which I think is pretty cool (standing by to be told that it features in game X by designer Y): during the set-up phase all the players fill out a char sheet with things like age, gender, job, body type, edges and hindrances etc. (e.g. tenacious vs alcoholic, or a trait that could be either positive or negative- resolute/obstinate, cf. Jaws of the Six Serpents), then all the sheets are put into a hat and drawn randomly. The players would then be able to spend 1-3 MPs (they\u2019ll be given 3 MP at the start) to change one~three things about their character. They are then randomly given their missions, may look at them briefly and then will each have the opportunity <b>once</b> to either move all the missions one place to the left or right, exchange theirs with another player, or reshuffle them, or all the above, again by spending 1-3 MPs. Whatever MPs remain unspent at the start of the game proper can be spent during the first mission.  <br/><br/>What to do about having several missions going on at once? Option 1: have one overall mission for the player party, frx Evil Under the Sun: you are ordered to visit the seaside on a blisteringly hot summer\u2019s day to ruin folks\u2019 holidays. You each say what you intend to do- cause havoc at the beach, in the amusement park, in the bars and cafes etc.- then, if you see another player doing well, jump into his or her scene and try to thwart their plans. Option 2: have separate missions, but during the set-up phase build rivalries into char gen, so that the players always know who they want to try to screw over during the game, regardless of the mission. Option 3: same as Option 2, but simply have the players jump in and out of each other\u2019s scenes, encouraging them with the promise of earning the other player\u2019s MP should they succeed, and accordingly rising in the estimation of the Boss. <br/><br/>Have just moved and will be pre-occupied with that for a few days so won\u2019t be on the formus much. Keep them suggestions coming in though! Thanks y\u2019all.<br/><br/>*Might have to low-ball that- don't want a visit by sharp-suited lawyers from WoTbro. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
