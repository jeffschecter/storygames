You can even read the rules while playing.<br/>- The game rules are less than three pages long and a session takes around 70 minutes.<br/>- It takes place in an alternative 1930's universe. Sources of inspiration are Indiana Jones, King Kong, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, Tintin, The Rocketeer, King Solomon's Mines, and similar movies.<br/>- It's built for 3-5 people in mind.<br/>- It will be launched at Indiegogo.<br/><br/>If you ever followed <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/profile/discussions/4073/Rickard" rel="nofollow">my previous threads</a>, those thoughts are what spawned this game. This is the second game that I aim to publish and I need your help to see if people can understand how to play it. I want suggestions on how to make the text more clear and feedback on how it plays. It would be incredible if you could record the session in any way, either in audio or video, but that's not a requirement. You will need to print ten pages, where six of them are characters, three are maps and two are game aids for the game master.<br/><br/>If this sounds interesting, whisper your real name and email address to me, and I will send you a playtest document.<br/><br/>If you want more information, check out my <a href="http://www.erebaltor.se/rickard/tip" rel="nofollow" target="_new">temporary site</a> for the game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422591/#Comment_422591" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-08T08:53:08+00:00" title="October  8, 2013  8:53AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2013 8:56AM by Rickard.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps I should add that I usually send the finished game to my playtesters and proofreaders?<br/><br/>The only thing now is that I don't  know if I will be able to publish the game, because it will be crowdfunded.<br/><br/>An early draft of the game can <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/400672#Comment_400672" rel="nofollow">be found here</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
