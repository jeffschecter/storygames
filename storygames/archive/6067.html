I decided to stop adding stuff on Van Dread(it was getting bogged down) and instead make <b>Orphanage </b>into a smaller game. What's the Orphanage you say? Well...<br/><br/><b>Orphanage </b>is a game about kids in an orphanage, sometime around the 1950s. Life in an orphanage is pretty shitty on itself, what with the dead parents, bullies and limited food selection, but it's about to get a lot worse.<br/>See every orphanage, as any self-respecting institution has it's own scary legends. Unlike most legends though, in Orphanage, the legends are all true and something prowls the orphanage at night, looking for victims...<br/>So do you fight for your new home, your friends in the Orphanage and the other innocent kids? Or do you plan an escape and run away from this horrible place? Will the cute girl ever talk to you? And you still have to steal back your swiss army knife from the headmaster. '<br/><br/>I'm going hippie on this one, and using a mix of aspects(from Fate) and ''skills'' from Ditv, with no normal skills or attributes. <br/>I hope to be done with it soon, although the monsters are giving me a bit of trouble. I will possibly using urban legend-like bogeymen. <br/>I'm also concerned about the setting's date, since I know very little about the 50s and i should probably read up on that.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135494/#Comment_135494" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T01:19:47+00:00" title="March 19, 2008  1:19AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Orphanages in the 40's and 50's are a tricky matter, since many of them were places of horror and suffering already. Although things like the Magdalane Laundries were somewhat earlier at their worst we know now that the rule in many of these places was physical and sexual abuse of children who had no one to defend them (certainly in britain and probably other countries too). Now of course you don't have to play like that, but if you set a horror game in an orphanage you have to aware of that background, which could have a big effect on the feel. (Look at the recent publicity of Haute de la Garrene in Jersey to see how many people see Orphanages and homes now).<br/><br/>Now I don't know if it is intentional but I get a more light and humerous feel from your description above, more hi-jinks than beatings, more famous five than abusive Nuns. If so you might want to set it in a Boarding School than an Orphanage. Yes, it means the kids have parents, but the parents aren't there and in many cases want nothing at all to do with the kids (doubly so if you move it back another 10-15 years as well).<br/><br/>Just a suggestion though <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135496/#Comment_135496" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T01:45:01+00:00" title="March 19, 2008  1:45AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A boarding school would probably work better, but I'm really into the whole Orphanage thing. I'm aiming for US orphanages in the 50s(they whole orphanage thing begun changing after that and it wouldn't really work for my game). I'll allow some artistic liberties to make orphanages not-so-abusive. I think USA orphanages during the 50s were a lot better than before.<br/>What I left out about the Orphanage is that it's very Orwellian in nature and does in fact involve strict headmasters and staff. The point is that when you're living in an orphanage, you still live your life. You're a kid, you care about stuff like your favorite knife and friendship.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135533/#Comment_135533" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T09:41:18+00:00" title="March 19, 2008  9:41AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            George, give Puppetland a glance, you might find some inspiration for tone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135573/#Comment_135573" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T12:49:02+00:00" title="March 19, 2008 12:49PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jarrod</cite>George, give Puppetland a glance, you might find some inspiration for tone.</blockquote>\nPuppetland was my first ever story game.

Aspects are cool in Spirit of the Century and traits are cool in Dogs in the Vineyard, but in what way are these concepts cool in your game?<br/><br/>Just because something works well in other games, does not mean that they are right for the fiction you want to produce with your game. Actually, from my first impression (which could be wrong), I do not think that aspects and trait would be the most elegant way to get the fiction you want out of the game. <br/><br/>For example, if I ask about the children's fight for survival, their mental state, the things they hold dear, and how this relate to the monster which are stalking them. How would this be described with aspects and traits?<br/><br/>Apart from that, I think this is a really cool idea.<br/><br/> - Anders                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135833/#Comment_135833" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T10:19:01+00:00" title="March 21, 2008 10:19AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Anders Larsen</cite>Good Stuff<br/><br/>- Anders</blockquote>\nIt is indeed inspired by the Devil's Backbone and maybe a bit by Orfanateo to a lesser degree.<br/>What I meant by aspects and skills from DitV is a mix of the two, not both.
