I know more time isn't necessarily the answer, but we try and play in evenings and not go "too late." I think I may be expecting too much of the time we have set aside, but need more data to be sure.<br/><br/>So what's everybody's average session time like? What times of day/night do you play?

Less than once a week feels too little.  More than twice feels like too much.  Typically I play on a weekday night after work.  Occasionally on weekends.

As in, 3 hours (3.5 at a push) now feels optimal to me. I keep thinking I can push it a little further, and that if we could get meaningful sessions out of 2 hours or less I might get more gaming in (2 hrs on a weeknight is much easier for me to cope with after a day at work)... and we might even get more interest in RPGs (if they're the length of a movie, say).<br/><br/>While I've zipped through, say, 3-player Fiasco games in just over an hour, I think there must be some emergent best practice (beyond aggressive scene framing and PACE at the forefront of the GMs mind) that'll lead to these shorter sessions being possible. Rules complexity needn't be a problem - I ran Burning Wheel last year at a con with only 1 of the 5 players having ever experienced it before and fit into a 3-hour slot. When I playtested the scenario with my home group (admittedly, with only 2 players) we were done in under 2 hours - I actually had to pad it out and add an encounter to make it fit the con session length.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355792/#Comment_355792" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-24T14:37:44+00:00" title="January 24, 2012  2:37PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2012 5:17PM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Typically between 3 and 4 hours of AP, with snacks and piss breaks taken as individuals not as a group. <br/><br/>So, we're playing for the whole time once everyone shows up and gets their shoes off, even if everyone's not at the table every second of that.<br/><br/>Oh, and to address you're point, OP:<br/><br/>Having people show up on time or early is key.

I wonder if it's that being tied to the computer means you have to get your stuff together beforehand.  Nobody wants to answer the call at 6:30, but then immediately leave the computer to get a drink and a bowl of chips - people naturally tend to do those things beforehand.  So when the call starts, everyone has done their 'get ready to play' ritual already.<br/><br/>Also, I suspect that a conference call, which doesn't allow for parallel conversations, tends to dissuade four people from breaking into two off-topic conversations.  Play can be derailed by a side conversation, since there aren't any.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356783/#Comment_356783" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-30T14:28:54+00:00" title="January 30, 2012  2:28PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Weekend days at a FLGS, maybe 11am-3 or 4pm.

The reason I want to do the same with friends as I do professionally, is that the time-limit gives more intense and focused gameplay. There is less messing around in the game-time.<br/><br/><i>Note; the game I use, Fabula, has a conflict resolution system that is fast and effective. Using older games, like Warhammer or D&amp;D, I would recommend a bit more time to play (3-4 hours).

I wonder how much of the way we all view things about our games is based on our early experiences.  When I was a kid we'd play for a few hours after dinner every day but I'd totally play ten hour games on Saturdays.  As a mid-teen, we might start playing games Friday afternoon and stop sometime on Sunday after fairly spartan sleep opportunities.  That might be the same game all weekend -- like thirty hours of play, or maybe mixing it up between several games and even including board games and movies and stuff.  So now, my five hours games don't seem at all long and it's weird when we decide that a good stopping place has come up after four hours or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356957/#Comment_356957" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T10:24:04+00:00" title="January 31, 2012 10:24AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Usually 3 hours, but about another 1.5hrs of recap and BS talking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357059/#Comment_357059" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T14:52:14+00:00" title="January 31, 2012  2:52PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2012 2:52PM by framweard.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We set aside four hours, but I really lose focus starting around hour two.
