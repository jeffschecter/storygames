It's a dead project.</blockquote>\nNope, it was me too! And yeah, my project was sorta stillborn too.<br/><br/>A post almost two years ago on "Tactica":<br/><a href="http://zigguratbuilder.livejournal.com/14200.html" rel="nofollow">http://zigguratbuilder.livejournal.com/14200.html</a><br/><br/>Me and Tim, when we met up at GC2005, talked a bit about this, because we too had the similar ideas; The "good parts" of Final Fantasy, without the "bad parts". I remember we had a thread a while back again about FF-style gaming, and I came to the idea that everyone has things that they loves about the series, things they didn't like... and those things tend to be a little different for everyone. And yet, sometimes they line up a little.<br/><br/>Me and Tim had some ideas that overlapped. Me and Mark had other ideas that overlapped. And if I recall corectly, all of our "favorite" FFs are different (mine was X, followed by the sublime X-2 (but ONLY because of X)). I also liked the "chessboard style" tactical play of Disgaea.<br/><br/>So yeah, I had that idea that you had this "tactical game", where you played it out on a chessboard or other similar "squarish" board, and made gains through battle. Those gains would turn into bonuses on the "roleplaying side" of your sheet. Higher strength score.Additional rolls to fall in love, that sort of thing.<br/>Then there was the "non-tactical game", basically all the standard RPG bits (though later designs make it look more like My Life With Master in terms of lightness, and geared towards a certain kind of story), including the traditional "I jump over a hole" to the more "I make a connection with others". The bonuses you got during the roleplaying section carried over to the tactical section: You could get bigger combat bonuses, etc.<br/><br/>In the end, it failed because it required more inspiration and work than I was willing to give it. However, TAKE BACK OF FREEDOM was *nothing* more than my attempt to pull Tactica out of the closet, dust it off, and give it another shot using a mecha setting:<br/><a href="http://www.game-chef.com/workshop/?PostBackAction=Download&amp;AttachmentID=287" rel="nofollow">http://www.game-chef.com/workshop/?PostBackAction=Download&amp;AttachmentID=287</a><br/><br/>I failed there because I didn't have enough time to put the tactical game part together. But if you read the last 1-2 pages, you can see the notes that I was working with, and some ideas how the tactical bits give gains to the roleplaying side and vice-versa.<br/><br/>Basically, I realized for *my* game (and Mark is free to stealzorz this, cause it won't be for a bit that I'll have time to work on it again, at least a month or two), is that I wanted little actual number-crunching, and very little die rolling (if any!). In return, I was thinking of supplemental cards, sheets with counters that slid up and down, etc. There might be numbers, but there wouldn't be a lot of addition/subtraction required.  There might be dice, but they would only be used rarely, not like in poorly designed Steve Jackson games like FRAG (mentioned above): "Roll to move! Roll to shoot! Now you roll to dodge! Now roll to do damage! Now you roll to soak damage!" After all, you'll notice that during battles in those games like FF or Disgaea, it's not a completely random amount of damage dealt: In some battles you'll see that your dude is either doing "72", "144", or sometimes "288" damage (depending on weaknesses, etc): To me, I was like "what's the difference between that and "2, 3 and 4 damage"?<br/><br/>One problem with creating a tactical game from scratch, BTW: It's hard to predict all the ins and outs without playtesting A LOT, and a lot of thought has to be put into elements that might break the game. That's HARD WORK, yo. One element, frex, is this: In a tactical board game, if one person is being beaten, a common strategy is to disk around and retreat all over the board from the enemy, turning the enemy's 1-minute win into a stalemate of piece-moving that lasts 10 minutes or more, until the player gives up. I basically came up with a "retreating back towards the player costs more movement/action points".<br/><br/>The other thing was that I wanted to make actual board tactics important in the game. A big of a chess-ish bit. Having three guys spread within a few squares of each other would be more tactically sound than just getting one strong dude and marching straight to the enemy. Good idea, but trying to work it out with the caveat of "I want it sorta rules light" was hard.<br/><br/>Anyway, blaaaah. LMK if this inspires.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
