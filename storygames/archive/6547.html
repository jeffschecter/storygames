A guy showed up to the screening wearing a wizard's costume replete with conical hat; and he handed out lightning bolts made of construction paper.  The funniest part was that only after the movie did I find out he wasn't part of the movie at all, just a dude who showed up in costume.  The director wasn't a gamer, but he said he tried very hard to remain a neutral observer.  I bought a signed copy of the DVD from him after watching the movie at the festival.<br/><br/>It was better than I expected.  The "answer" of the movie for one of the people involved was a bit damning to gaming in general and there were a few sad characters shown (a couple of high school dropouts, a guy with a relationship problem with his daughter).  But they also highlighted a guy who used LARPing to get over his own shyness and another guy who used it to kindof pick up girls.  All in all, there were some amusing moments and it was entertaining.<br/><br/>D&amp;D was the only tabletop RPG discussed and it was barely mentioned.  WoW was heavily featured.<br/><br/>I've shown it to gamer friends who also found it amusing and didn't get upset about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
