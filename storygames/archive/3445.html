I started to realize that I was burning out. Back in my easier job a couple years back, setting aside a few hours for campaign prep and the like was no big deal, but since I joined my new company (which I love, mind) I've had less free time and more stress. Games with little GM-prep were much more appealing recently, until I just realized I had run out of steam.<br/><br/>So what I ended up doing was setting the expectations that Actual RPG Gaming is, for the forseeable future, going to happen every <i>other</i> week. That's more than enough time to recharge batteries and hit the gaming (be it PTA or GURPS) with renewed vigor.<br/><br/>In those other weeks, we still meet, but we BS for about an hour on politics and science, then we play 1-2 Crazy German Boardgames, which is our other passion.<br/><br/>We've fallen in love with some of these unique games, and together have been researching which ones to pick up next.  Citadels, Ra, Tikal, Puerto Rico, BattleLore (occasionally) and Settlers of Catan (anytime gaming doesn't happen we throw down with Settlers) for now, later Princes of Florence, Traders of Genoa, El Grande, and maybe that new pretty Samurai game with the weird tower-thingy. Two weeks ago we even decided for gaming night to go on a Field Trip, all piling in a car and cruising to a local boardgame-focused shop to scope out the board games and RPGs there.<br/><br/>It was an experiment, started about 6 weeks ago.  6 Weeks Later, and I am way less stressed out about gaming, can still throw down and have a blast, and am now in a zone where everything's manageable, thanks to those crazy German board games, science chat, and the ability to take a step back and see what was and wasn't working.<br/><br/>Anyone else?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77603/#Comment_77603" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T18:52:57+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  6:52PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2007 6:54PM by Eric.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>We've fallen in love with some of these unique games, and together have been researching which ones to pick up next.

So rather than run for three hours, I ran a short session (which was ok for me, I burned up all my energy in 90 mins of decent gaming rather than eke it out to 3 hours of mediocre gaming) and then we played a multiplayer Halo 2 game for another couple of hours.  Which was fun, and very much not roleplaying.  Ah, the joys of having two XBoxen.<br/><br/>There have been times when we've deliberately played Plunder, Pirate's Cove or Skull and Sword and put off the start of a new game by a week.  No biggie.  It's not like playing board games isn't fun.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I also found that switching up games works very well.  I'm finding our current PtA game very demanding in certain ways and not so much in others.  But running Agon is a completely different experience.

I recognize that!<br/><br/>Hrmm ... does a large social footprint correlate with burnout? Wouldn't surprise me.<br/><br/>It probably does correlate somewhat.  I also think that people get excited about a new idea for a game at the beginning and fail to think about how easy the activity is going to be to maintain after the first couple of sessions.  This is (or has been for me) a bigger issue in those infinitely long campaigns rather than games like Great Ork Gods that last a couple of hours and are over.  Still, with a little foresight you can make even long term games (infinite footprint) manageable in terms of burn-out.  How?  Here's some ways I can think of:<br/><br/>1.)  Stretch out the game cycle a bit.  Why do we gamers feel like we have to play a campaign at least once a week?  Or heaven forbid, more than once a week.  Once or twice a month keeps the prep to manageable proportions and allows time to recharge batteries between sessions.<br/><br/>2.)  Distribute those social responsibilities that generally fall on the GM.  Why does the GM have to host the game, organize the munchies, make sure everyone is going to be there, and all the other social crap?  Doesn't he have enough to do just prepping the game?  Give him a break and dole these other jobs out to everyone else.  That way no one person gets burn out due to being overworked.<br/><br/>3.)  Make your game such that different players can sit in the GM chair from time to time.  Nothing helps with the GM burn-out like being able to just play from time to time.<br/><br/>4.)  Do other activities (like boardgames or going out for beers) between sessions or even in place of a session here and there.  Doing other things is sort of like clensing the ol' mental palate.  My personal suggestion is paintball.  Shooting your fellow players repeatedly is great therapy.<br/><br/>Anywho, that's my take on the burnout issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77725/#Comment_77725" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-26T06:51:22+00:00" title="June 26, 2007  6:51AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim Gray</cite><br/>And yes, "Just don't play" is fine for those people like Jason who are gaming on their own  ;p  but when you're in a group there's more to it than that because what you do connects with what other people get to do.</blockquote>\nYeah, I forgot to mention: My bi-weekly group is a 4-person "The GM Shifts" kind of setup. So if I don't feel like running, I can just say, "Someone else run something for a bit", and that works out. Plus, because of the bi-weekly thing, I tend to get burned out less.<br/><br/>My weekly group, though, is a collection of five "friends who also game", where I'm the main GM (every few months one of the others will step up and run something for a bit, but mostly it's my show).  So 'just not showing up' is kind of a slap in their face, and simply stopping running anything means that we still meet on Thursdays and just stare blankly at each other. :-)<br/><br/>There's more to it than retreating, sorry I left out some of the background in my initial post.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77730/#Comment_77730" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-26T07:19:33+00:00" title="June 26, 2007  7:19AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, have you thought about or tried running games which shift to the "Game" end of RPG when you're running a bit low on creativity?  I mean, you sound like you're actually going "one better" than that and plunging straight into regular, not-at-all-RPG games.<br/><br/>Like Contenders for example.  One of the things I like best about that game is that if you have no idea what to do in your scene, you can look to the mechanics and think about it in terms of your "best" option, tactically, and do that.  I find that takes a lot of the stress out of the thing and makes for a less burnout-y session.<br/><br/>Does that even make any sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77731/#Comment_77731" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-26T07:21:55+00:00" title="June 26, 2007  7:21AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All right, all right. Yes, if you have adopted some obligation which requires you to play, in order to not play you'll have to break your obligation and what the consequences will be, I can't say. But there's a simple solution to this too: <i>Don't incur an obligation to play.</i><br/><br/>I know my group's cohesion and get-alongness has improved dramatically since, about 2 years ago, we said "You know what, it's nice that everyone's bending over backwards to get here once a week, but fuck it, it's gaming, we're friends, it's not like it's a race, if someone doesn't feel like gaming, or coming over, they don't have to."<br/><br/>Sometimes that means that because one person is missing, we don't play.

In my experience, "burn out" isn't when you don't want to play, but it's when you want the social-creative payoff of play but you don't want to deal with the pile of logistics (prep, hosting, food, etc) that play typically requires.  "Just don't play" isn't a solution, here, because you're still going to be bummed that you didn't get the play payoff.  Solutions to burnout need to find ways to get the play payoff without incurring the logistical mess that comes with it -- and keep in mind, a <em>different</em> logistical mess, even a larger one, may be preferable to the same-old logistical mess that you don't want to deal with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77778/#Comment_77778" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-26T09:40:33+00:00" title="June 26, 2007  9:40AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting distinction, and I know just what you mean. If it's the logistical crap that's not any fun, then <i>don't do the logistical crap</i>.  Have someone else in the group do it. If nobody else in the group wants to do it either, THEN play doesn't occur, and that's a shame, but it beats requiring someone to be miserable.<br/><br/>Right now I am the only one in the group that sends out the weekly reminder e-mail of when we are playing, where, and what.  About 3 years ago I tried to give that responsibility away and the reminder e-mail didn't happen. People ended up calling each other not knowing what was going on and everyone was unhappy. Except me. I needed a break, I took a break.<br/><br/>I suppose this wouldn't work if you gamed with 16 year olds, or idiots. But if they're adults, they can do these things themselves if they want it done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
