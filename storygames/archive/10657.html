It's a high-end passenger ship.  I've planned to extend the voyage by besetting the ship with ill-fortune, and want to take advantage of the travel time to let the players flesh out thier characters.<br/><br/>What I'm looking for is some thoughts for scenes to help with this.<br/><br/>For example, at some point during the journey, there will be a pirate attack.  What the player characters decide to do will help determine (potentially) their Swashbuckling Fortes, Foibles, etc.  "I head above deck with my saber and lay into the boarding party." [Fencing Swashbuckling Forte]  "The crew should have it in hand, right?  I, um, hide, erm, stay below decks to protect myse, erm, the other passengers." [Cowardly Foible]<br/><br/>What sorts of things happen during a sky-ship trip that players can interact with, react to, and generally use to help define thier fortes, motivations, and the like?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
