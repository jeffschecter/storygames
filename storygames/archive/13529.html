Refining some structures within the game, simplifying whenever I found something superfluous during the recent playtests, etc.<br/><br/>However, sometimes I do have the feeling of being a tiny ant standing on the shoulders of giants. Whatever solution I try to come up with, like, say, determining narration authorities in my game, feels like something already seen, so even if the main crunch structure has a certain novelty, it's thanks to what lies in the past that I may be creating what i'm creating right now. Had there not been Polaris, Beyond the Mirror would probably not even be a masterless game.<br/>How do you cope with that? Do you ever feel like your game lacks of originality even when playtesters give you enthusiastic feedback?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305669/#Comment_305669" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T06:09:59+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  6:09AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Think of all those writers who realized that the plot of their novel is the same as the plot from some work of Shakespear, an episode of Gilmore Girls, and the comercial for Lucky Charms. Worry less about your originality than making the game you want to make. If it isn't a word for word copy of Dogs in the Vinyard, Vincent has no real grounds to be unhappy. Your game will be yours no matter its influences and if those influences don't work together it will show in playtesting and you will fix it. <br/><br/>Be just and fear not; do not let your feelings about this be a reason to stop creating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway" title="Brendan_Conway"><img alt="Brendan_Conway" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway">Brendan_Conway</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305671/#Comment_305671" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T06:48:43+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  6:48AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know exactly how you feel. My GameChef entry, which I'm still working on, had vast tracts of territory which were inspired almost whole cloth from How We Came To Live Here, which I had recently played when I made the game. It felt odd, knowing that, seeing that, even though at the time of design, I hadn't been thinking about it; it was only in retrospect that I saw those similarities. Brennan Taylor saw them, too, but ultimately, he was kind enough to say that he liked the game, thought I should keep working on it, and perhaps most importantly, that I shouldn't be trying to reinvent the wheel. If I recall correctly, he likened it to computer code: you don't redesign a whole new code every single time you want to write a program, because it's okay to use the code that came before. It's there, it's a useful tool, and it's a waste of your time and energy not to use it if it's appropriate. That was a big help to me.<br/><br/>I think I mostly get past this by not realizing what I'm doing when I'm designing, only seeing it on retrospect, and then telling myself that it's okay to have built on the tremendous work of others. <br/><br/>(Which is why I will be publishing, on Thor's suggestion, a new game called "Cogs in the Junkyard," about robots who enforce the will of the Factory, the divine source of all true life in the Junkyard. They wander around from wreck to wreck, ensuring that no sinful breaches of programming take place.)<br/><br/>(Goddammit, I meant that as a joke, and now I actually kind of like it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305673/#Comment_305673" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T06:51:25+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  6:51AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Suna</cite>How do you cope with that?</blockquote>\nBe open and gracious about your influences. <br/><br/>Wanting to be "original" is a terrible idea.

Old ideas are good, new ideas might be good. Mix them up. <br/><br/>Remember that this won't be the last thing that you do, this is an "early work". If you approach it that way, you can take away some of the societal pressure to do something original. <br/><br/>And, like, nothing's really original. Take Metallica, f'rex. They're all stoked on their own music, ok. But how many props do they give to the inventors of the guitar? How 'bout those folks who came up with wound metal strings, or electric pick-ups, or four-four time? (Metallica would really be fucked without 4/4 time.) How 'bout that whole concept of western tunings and scales and stuff? Wanky solos and grunty lyrics wouldn't communicate the same UMPH without all that stuff invented by those giants of history.<br/><br/>Now, i'm not saying go and stand on Metallica's shoulders. As you might've guessed, i hate the fucking sin out of Metallica. I'm saying give yourself a break - you're completely surrounded by folks who rip off or build on the inventions of those who came before. If you can face it and give props to 'em by name - well, hell! That shows a lot of tough, a lot of like self-knowledge and shit. like... RE... SPECT... WALK...

I mean, sure, Ron always touted Sorcerer as a descendant of Over the Edge, but it was easy for me to dismiss that, like "sure, I can see the similarity but OtE is so <i>primitive</i> and Sorcerer is so <i>brilliant.</i> Whereas Shock: has a really focused bibliography that celebrates its influences in detail, and contained a lot of designs that I respect, so I was open to the insight.<br><br>The phrase that did it for me is, "In many ways, Shock: is a purpose-build modification of PTA."<br/><br/>When I read that, something clicked and I went "oh my God it SO IS!" And my world was never the same.<br/><br/>I realized that designers are "stealing" from each other all the time, and it's more about the particular arrangement of parts than about inventing all your own parts, which is impossible anyway. This helped me to break into design myself.<br/><br/>When I entered game Chef 2008, I ended up building my game Spectre of the Beast (still in development, now called "Mortar of Utopia") largely on the chassis of Shock:. In many ways it's a similar game--you play Protagonists in an invented world (though a past one, rather than future) whose pursuit of their goals have a profound effect on society, and play revolves around the attendant issues. So I took Shock's Protagoniost/Antagonist roles, series of scenes each with a conflict, and based Ambitions roughly on Story goals. I added a Hope mechanic somewhat like that in Contenders (which also apportions protagonism and antagonism similar to Shock:). But on top of that chassis I arranged pieces in such a way that they would work a certain way in play, which is different than the way they work in Shock:.<br/><br/>Joshua's approach to presenting his influences gave me an implicit permission to do that. To look at previous ingenious applications of tools and suss out my very own application, similar yet distinct, without feeling that I had to start from scratch. Now, I do still get the feeling sometimes that "all the ground has been covered," and certainly as more and more niches get filled it will be trickier and trickier to find a distinctive statement to make. I believe it's valuable to ask, for any design idea (or any art, really), "could this thing be done well with existing works?" Or put another way, "What do I want to say with this design, distinct from what others are saying?"<br/><br/>Notice I say "distinct" instead of "new." The key isn't to find what hasn't been done, the key is to find your own voice. that voice will be in chorus with a hundred others, and will owe its inspiration to thousands more. But if you focus on finding that, on saying the thing that's welling up in you and DEMANDING that it be said, you'll do well.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>PS I LOVE the Bullwinkle and Rocky Role Playing Party Game and would love to play it.

Novel ideas tend to be shaky and you'll need to run them through their paces. At the same time, just because something worked for a different game, doesn't mean it'll translate to yours. <br/><br/>That being said, deep innovation likely undermines a game's potential for popularity and frequent play - so if that is part of your goals then you should be happy about the resemblance to familiar games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305812/#Comment_305812" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T19:21:35+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  7:21PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My game designs always look like a Frankenstein's monster made of chopped up bits of other games.

Like, hate. I thought his paintings were ugly, the color palettes jarring, his brushstrokes a pompous statement about how he was so talented he didn't have to try like the rest of us to properly use paint.<br/><br/>My junior year in art school I took an illustration class. Already far into my education, I had a good handle on the basics, and so I was kinda insulted when our teacher asked us to do what we did in jr high art class "copy Guernica". Really? I was soooo beyond that. I understood abstract art, what it was about, and I hated Picasso. Begrudgingly, I started the project.<br/><br/>And... I couldn't do it. It was fucking hard to copy. My rendition was like a 6 year old took some crayons and macaroni and tried to create a masterpiece.<br/><br/>That's when I started liking Picasso.<br/><br/>All this to say... it takes a lot of work to be a master. But that doesn't mean you can't work at getting there. I know that I'll be working on being as good as Picasso for the rest of my life (and really, that's not a goal I would like to achieve... what makes me happy about creating is not the same thing that made Picasso happy about creating), but I really enjoy putting myself to the challenge. Have confidence in what you create, learn from what came before you, and know that, while you're not Picasso, you're making something beautiful and unique because it came from you.<br/><br/>You get better at designing things by going through the process of designing them.

In the process, while both started with the same mechanical root (what we're calling Cortex Plus now) each was influenced by my own exploration of indie games and by Josh and Rob's design tastes. I don't think anybody is going to call them original, but I think they took ideas and system elements to new places (if nothing else, hauling some of them into mainstream) and succeeded in emulating the genre/license we sought to emulate.<br/><br/>Now that they're out, people are hacking the games to do other things, and I think that's really cool, too. This is a positive thing in the design culture, to my mind, and so long as nobody goes around saying "my stuff is teh best and ur stuff is teh crap" we can all benefit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305943/#Comment_305943" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-25T22:44:49+00:00" title="December 25, 2010 10:44PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After reading the thread, I think here's an angle that's been hinted at but not directly stated:<br/><br/>I don't worry about stealing, I celebrate it. That's the point. Doing anything even vaguely creative often means you're part of a creative community, and that includes building on the work of others in that community. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, etc. Creation done right is a community process, and the myth of the lonely creator is just that--mythical, and potentially harmful as well. Renaissance Florence and the explosion of genius? Try Renaissance Florence and a tightly-knit system of apprenticeship and training. With few exceptions, great creators are great because they interact with other creators, and stealing is part and parcel with that creative community.<br/><br/>Of course there are lonely aspects of creation, too, hard work that has to be done on one's own, and that unique individual viewpoint will make the work distinct, maybe even innovative. I don't think I can put it better than it already was:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>Have confidence in what you create, learn from what came before you, and know that, while you're not Picasso, you're making something beautiful and unique because it came from you.</blockquote>\nFurthermore, most innovation is incremental rather than in leaps and bounds. You take something someone else made and do something different with it, maybe improve it a little. Once in a while you have a quantum leap like say, Dogs in the Vineyard, Primetime Adventures, or Polaris, but even those giant leaps sprang from the accumulated little steps taken as a community while everyone used other people's works and ideas. Much like Cam's story, these cobbled-together Frankenstein's monsters will most likely be cannibalized for someone else's monster, and maybe lead to better, stronger monsters. It will be the designer's hard work that makes it possible, of course, but it's the community that makes such innovations happen faster, makes them better, and makes the process more social and fun than any creative hermitage could ever be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306003/#Comment_306003" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-26T20:22:29+00:00" title="December 26, 2010  8:22PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thought: maybe you're writing a Shock: hack?

Rope-block. <br/>And, Christ on a crutch, how am I supposed to get onto the shoulders of these giants if it's so hard to find playtesters? <br/>/rant<br/><br/>As far as the thread topic is concerned, I'll repeat, a little differently maybe, what has already been said: there are only so many plots out there, so many ideas. Creativity is combining familiar elements in a compelling or interesting way - you need a little familiarity so it's recognizable and grabby, so distinction and uniqueness are incredibly overrated. <br/>It's all in the performance, not the idea, I say. I mean, to a point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306028/#Comment_306028" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-27T06:06:32+00:00" title="December 27, 2010  6:06AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

And even if it isn't destined to be a hack, building out your idea in the framework of an existing game will tell you that, because you will end up with cool stuff that doesn't fit the existing framework. I like Lady Blackbird for this - either it grows beyond what Lady Blackbird can do or it is a fun playable hack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

My words were probably too easily misunderstood, I apologize.<br/>What I meant is that shock: may address the same themes I'm addressing with my game, if you create the proper shock and issues. But thinking about it,<br/>it would do it in a completely different way.<br/><br/>Shock: has been a major inspiration in the beginning for sure. But so were Sebastian Hickey's Hell For Leather and Ben Lehman's Polaris. <br/>To be honest, in some of its aspects shock: is to me a reference for what I don't want the Beyond the Mirror experience to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306293/#Comment_306293" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-29T20:02:10+00:00" title="December 29, 2010  8:02PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tazio,<br/>\n  You should watch "Flash of Genius" it is a great movie about the creative mind.
