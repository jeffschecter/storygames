Every time we accomplish something we grow?</blockquote>\nHeh. Ahh, looking at my post, it looks like I'm making a metaphor for everyday life.<br/><br/>In truth, nope,<b> <i>I actually mean a real RPG</i></b>, prob a trad fantasy game. See, I want to give levels for that awesome stuff above, but in a game that focuses on 10-30 levels max, giving out a level is a Serious Thing. Needs to be a game where giving out levels is Not So Serious, where a gain of 1-3 levels per session just for doing in-game stuff is totally acceptable/common. But I'd offload it to real life.<br/><br/>I love social games like Ostracon and the drinking game "I never...", but ones where people get to talk about/show off the other stuff they do and gain in life. I just want to couple that with an actual (fun) RPG. <br/><br/>I could do this wil D&amp;D, but as mentioned above I'd have to ramp-up the in-life gains so as not to have people jump ten levels in a month.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>Edit: Back in the day, I had an idea for a "Fitness d20" supplement, where you would track and record gains made to diet and physical fitness ("I could only bench-press 100lb, now I can press 150!" "I just joined Tae Kwan Do, and now I can do a wicked Wing-Chugee!"). Turned out that, to make it uniform and consistent, with gains that would supplement character XP but not be too fast or too slow, basically was faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar more work than it was worth. But I still hold an idea of coupling fitness gains with RPG "eeps". This is kind of a modified version of that desire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179366/#Comment_179366" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-19T14:46:37+00:00" title="November 19, 2008  2:46PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy: You could do something like giving 1/4th or 1/5th of a level's worth of XP per thing if you wanted to do D&amp;D. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if I finish my NaNo novel and bring food to the first session wherein I do 50 pushups, can I start at 3rd level?

The former requires nothing but a more or less fit person, while the latter demands a deeply prepared and trained one. Why would I run a marathon then?<br/><br/>My first tought would be to ballance things by assigning different gains. (The pushops would give you one level, while the marathon would mean gaining 3 or 4.) But then I'm not very sure that would keep up with the Zen of the game.<br/><br/>Then I tought about something. I would separate those 100 levels in different kind of neat stuff... Something like 40 "piece of cake" levels, who would give you something simple, such as some bonuses and that's it, and that you can do simple effort stuff to gain; then 40 "let's rock" levels, who would give you nice powers that make your character cooler and/or more effective, and that require some more consistent effort from you; and at last you have the remaining 20 "I am God" levels, that give you the trully breathtaking, over-the-top, signature habilities and the plot-twisting capabilities, and those require those mega good things to be achieved.<br/><br/>I think the nice thing about this is that it becomes somewhat easy to clasify something: Bringing food or doing 50 pushops would give me some "piece of cake", while writting a deep and detailed backstory for my guy would actually give me some nice "let's rock", possibly while linking my levels to that same backstory, and then achieving my goal weight will at long last give me something on the "I'm God" scale.<br/><br/>And then, likning those same levels to in-game stuff seems easy and coherent too. A big monster or adventure completed gives me something "piece of cake", while finishing a plot-line or reaching one of my character's middle term goals would give me some "let's rock", and those memorable campaign and/or story changing things and achieving one of my character's life dreams would translate in the coolest, "I'm God" stuff.<br/><br/>With some minimal guiding, it could be left to GM's fiat (or a democratic, group decision) with ease.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179384/#Comment_179384" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-19T17:17:15+00:00" title="November 19, 2008  5:17PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tristan,<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously? You wouldn't run a marathon for any amount of levels in a roleplaying game. If you're doing that, you're doing it for your own reasons. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, what if you died? Would you run another marathon to get those levels back? I don't think you get to keep levels for previous accomplishments, considering you start back at 1. <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, accomplish something cool, minor or major, get a level. Bringing in a different food every session would be enough for some steady level gain. Cooking for each session, too. Studying martial arts weekly and being able to demonstrate what you've learned. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not about what you've accomplished in the past, it's about what you've accomplished recently.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, it's not my idea, so I could be wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I think you've got some interesting ideas on breaking up the levels. Am I understanding correctly, in your break down, I could earn a piece of cake level for bringing food, and a let's rock level for passing my midterm, plus an I'm God level for becoming a father, all in the same session? ...because that's a very cool idea, if so. It's applicable to more traditional means of gaining levels, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179387/#Comment_179387" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-19T17:27:39+00:00" title="November 19, 2008  5:27PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tristan,<br/><br/>Wolfe kind of already said this, but the point is that you demonstrate new stuff that you just learned how to do.<br/>Doing push-ups well within your capability level, having not worked for it even remotely over the game campaign, just to gain a level... would be akin to being a munchkin power-gamer of the highest degree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179403/#Comment_179403" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-19T21:59:25+00:00" title="November 19, 2008  9:59PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Isn't this Land of 1000 Kings?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179404/#Comment_179404" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-19T22:19:17+00:00" title="November 19, 2008 10:19PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking of chore wars <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2007/07/20/" rel="nofollow">this</a> penny arcade describes the extremes of the idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179432/#Comment_179432" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-20T07:56:49+00:00" title="November 20, 2008  7:56AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2008 7:57AM by Tristan.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get what you are saying. And I'm thinking about two things in here.<br/><br/>First one is about commitment. It is not the same to run a marathon than to bring some food to the game. I might be running a marathon for my own reassons, but what's the incentive of bringing that up if I'd have done anything remotelly less interesting and meaningful?<br/><br/>And then there's the second one. I am precisely concerned about those munchkin morons that would keep "breaking" the idea, by doing all those meaningful stuff, and since they still get the same results...<br/><br/>And yeah, that was sort of the idea of breaking down the levels. Next time I want to level up, I won't be able to call my fatherhood, but what about me writting a book, or winning that marathon? My current most important achievment I want to brag about. I also think that tought could be adapted into other type of game dynamics, not just Andy's 100 levels by doing out-of-the-game stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179668/#Comment_179668" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T10:09:12+00:00" title="November 21, 2008 10:09AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not just make 10 louder?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179746/#Comment_179746" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T08:46:21+00:00" title="November 22, 2008  8:46AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Feel free to make an alternate XP system for <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=3479&amp;it=1" rel="nofollow">Console</a>, which already has 99 levels. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179776/#Comment_179776" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T14:16:48+00:00" title="November 22, 2008  2:16PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 22, 2008 2:18PM by Logos7.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like the idea behind giving out a level to make it happen more often and be less a serious thing, kinda destroys the level, also some of your examples are horrendously (and very funnily) mismatched.<br/><br/>Consider the i gain a level in atheletics guy everytime i do something athletic<br/><br/>So I run a marathon, do 50 pushups and learn a new yoga move<br/><br/>Athletics Guy 3<br/><br/>Then I bake a cake<br/><br/>Athletics Guy 3/ Cakemaker 1<br/><br/>Then I bring it to session and have a great session<br/><br/>Athletics Guy 3/ Cakemaker 1/ Gaming Guy 1<br/><br/>but in that session, I also completed in game stuff and a few other things on your list<br/><br/>Athletics Guy 3/Cakemaker 1/Gaming Guy 1/ Sensitive Lisener 2/ Awesome Story gamer 1<br/><br/>What I'm trying to get at is that by collapsing the levels down, you dont end up with levels you end up with skill-ups. If you don't want to diversify the levels (ie Athletics vs Cakebaking vs Whatever) you end up with XP. <br/><br/>An idea that I've had that in order to keep the levels being levels and not (Skills or Xp) is something like the Infinite Level System, where the game never stops, their is no cap and all that math stuff works right the whole way. 3.x tried really hard to do this and failed horribly (see epic play and spell casters). Levels are still levels by virtue of being more than just collections of xp (ie levels mean something, give preapportioned benefits, etc) but you can also give em out like a monkey nutter because hey their are infinite levels. <br/><br/>But if you do hand out nearly infininte levels in an infinite level game what is taht saying about the game?<br/><br/>(on the other hand, I think a pretty good hack of 3.x can be made , if you take the all those levels, and let everyone be whatever they want, but reduce the level cap to 10, but allow levels to go beside each other rather competing. Ie compress the old level 20 fighter into 10 levels (Feat , Feat ,Feat , feat ,etc) and do the same for all the classes. If someone just wants to fight they can be a level 10 fighter, if someone wants to be a fighter 10/mage 10 / Awesome Incarnate 10 they can do that as well. Balance it out with a small benefit for 'unspent' levels and hack out some of the worst dnd offenders (Skill system) I think you could make a really rocking hack out of it) <br/><br/>**This is upon reflection , really close to making a skill or percentile based system out of the 3.x dnd in a sense, and sufferes from the whole problem that I mentioned with collapsiing levels into skills or something of the like**<br/><br/>But anyway, Thank you for posting this, and for everyone for Responding <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Logos                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
