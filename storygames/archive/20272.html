Or is 'stack exchange' itself merely a programming term? Also, could you attempt to explain how to use it optimally?

Votes are a weird sort of social currency, and there are scoreboards for members who have lots of strongly-upvoted questions and answers and such.<br/><br/>The person who asked the question can designate any single answer--even if it's not the highest voted answer--as the Accepted Answer. It gets marked as such.<br/><br/>A person can place a "bounty" on any question (own or someone else's). Like "I put 50 points on the question: 'What is the OSR?'" After a certain amount of time, whoever gets the Accepted Answer will receive the bounty. Yay, points!<br/><br/>There's a fair amount of indie game stuff on there.<br/><br/>I was very, very active on RPG StackExchange when it first came out and was consistently in the top five or so members, scorewise.

This includes abstract technical questions, like: As a GM, how do I choose what options to select in the ritual move in Dungeon world?<br/><br/>The site can accommodate extremely specific game recommendation questions, but they are treated with suspicion, so treat with care.<br/><br/>One can ask about social problems. The good answer will always be "talk to the people involved", with small possibility of useful personal experiences.<br/><br/>One can ask about history of the hobby.<br/><br/>One can ask answerable questions about existing bodies of rpg theory, but my intuition is that it would be socially risky.<br/><br/>"How to accomplish this or that as a GM/facilitator" is likely to work, as long as "this or that" is sufficiently narrow or well-defined. Treat with care.<br/><br/><br/>Main rules are: Ask a question that can be answered from authoritative sources or personal experience; answer questions based on those and with references when available. Stay strictly on topic. Don't start or continue discussions.<br/><br/><br/>Use RSS feeds to follow interesting tags or at least ignore non-interesting tags to stay sane.

Just got over 20,000 a month or two back. <br/><br/>My view is that for the most part the advocates of factual based questions for RPG Stack Exchange are a bunch of anal rentative dickwads. That the community should be far more helpful than they already are. <br/><br/>However I just ignore meta and vote how I want to vote and answer how I want to answer and take the down vote hits.  I am sure I am annoying as hell to some of the participants but on the other hand I did manage to get a score of 20,000 and still climbing.<br/><br/>What a real downer is the feeling of playing what a mole when a question pops up.

It not like they are rude or obnoxious. But it feel like a giant mystery for some users on how to ask a proper question. <br/><br/>For the technical and programming Stack Exchange sites this is not so bad because usually somebody has asked your question and you find it with a search. For the sites with "fuzzier" topic like history, and of course rpgs it can be downright maddening.<br/><br/>For example I asked how did sheepfolds were used in medieval herding over in the history. And it was closed because it was a "agricultural" question. There the users were obnoxious twits as to a man they pointed to MODERN references on herding.  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
