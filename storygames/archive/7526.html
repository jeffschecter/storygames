We played a whole module of it and enjoyed the shit out of it. One thing kept coming up in conversation, though, and so I pose it to you:<br/><br/>In 4E D&amp;D movement and character positions are tracked on a 1\u201dx1\u201d grid, each inch representing 5 feet. Characters can move a certain number of squares per turn. Nothing new here, right? Well, in 3.X D&amp;D, moving diagonally along that grid 1.5 times as many squares. Normally you represented this by having the first square cost 1 movement, the next 2, the third 1 again, so on and so forth. This keeps Pythagoras's theorem pretty happy, and all is well. In 4E, diagonal squares are counted 1 for 1, just like any other movement.<br/><br/>Now, I really do appreciate how much easier that makes movement, and generally I'm ok with playing that way (counting is hard, lol) but DAMN does it do some strange things to your brain when you try to figure out how that LOOKS from within the universe.<br/><br/>For example, my friend moved around a 10'x10' foot pit trap by moving diagonally to the right of the pit, up a square, then diagonally back left. 3 squares of movement. The same as crossing directly over the pit. What the fuck does that look like? Is it kinda like how sprites looked in Doom when they move diagonally towards you but never change facing at all? ARRGH!<br/><br/>I posed a similar question on a video gaming forum I frequent and got an interesting response. The old PC classic DOOM had a smiler \u201cfeature\u201d in it's engine. When moving diagonally, Doom adds your vector from X and Y together to get your total speed, so there's a strafing \u201csweet spot\u201d which will move your character much faster than is normally possible. It's called Straferunning.<br/><br/>I started thinking about a universe where Pythagoras's theorem was... different.<br/><br/>Track meets would have to be standardized to always go north/south or east/west. Buildings would be much cheaper to construct diagonally from North. Our Highway system would be downright bizarre.<br/><br/>I pose two questions to you all: What would a game look like where one of the truly fundamental aspects of our reality was different? Not just the normal \u201calternate universe where it rains dough nuts\u201d or whatever, more like Flatland. There's a SERIOUS fundamental difference. What differences would be most interesting?<br/><br/>And #2:<br/>More examples of how D&amp;D 4E would be drastically different because of this please! I find it terribly amusing.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167022/#Comment_167022" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T11:44:22+00:00" title="September  4, 2008 11:44AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This very conversation is happening now over on RPGNet:<br/><br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=401238" rel="nofollow">http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=401238</a><br/><br/>For me: Squares are easy. 1, 2, 1, 2 is good tracking for "realistic" environments, but it is overhead in play.

If you have a 2x2 block of squares, A-B on top, C-D below, and there's an obstruction (like a pit) at A, you can't move from C to B.  You gotta go C-D-B.  Unfriendly corners.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust geekin' out on you there.<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, it's a fairly simple metric:  The length of the hypoteneuse is equal to the <i>greater</i> of the two legs.  No addition, no squares or roots, no nothing.  Just take the larger one.  The smaller leg will get covered by diagonal steps, as you pointed out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI must have gotten too deep into non-euclidean geometry back in school:  That seems fairly natural to me.  There's a similar metric which is called the "Manhattan metric" which says that the hypoteneuse is equal to the sum of the two legs:  That one's got (eponymous) real world referents that are pretty simple:  If you're restricted to travelling on a grid, that's how long it actually takes you to get places.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuildings wouldn't be easier to construct on the diagonal, though:  It'd actually take more stones, because you couldn't leave a line of diagonals:  It's penetrable by sufficiently small creatures on the perpendicular diagonal.  You'd definitely want to build on the north-south.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems to me like there's a good living waiting for geomancers in this universe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J.%20Scott%20Timmerman" title="J.

Hear me out:<br/>\n<br/>\nA bow creates tension precisely because the distance traversed by the (inflexible) string when it travels <i>straight</i> between two points is less than the distance traversed when it takes a side-trip up and down a triangle.  Hence, when you draw the bowstring back, it must (in order to remain the same length) compress the distance between its two ends.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you hold a how horizontally, along a north-south (or east-west) axis, this effect does not occur in D&amp;D; at the same draw.  The distance from 0 to X is not altered by a diversion of Y on a perpendicular axis until such time as Y &gt; X/2.  Until that time, there would be <i>no</i> force pulling the string back toward center.  After that time, there would still be no force trying to reduce the distance X.  The distance from 0 up to Y and down to anything less than 2Y is going to be 2Y ... the maximum distance travelled in any individual axis.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, hold a D&amp;D; bow horizontally, and you will see the following behavior:  No force necessary to draw it all the way to 45 degrees, then you can't draw it another centimeter without breaking either the bow or string or both.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the moment, I'm thinking that people hold their bows upright, and that may make a big difference to the distance measure, but it's going to depend on that question at the top about jumping.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A" title="Albert A"><img alt="Albert A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://web.mac.com/albertwa/Ryoanji.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A">Albert A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167164/#Comment_167164" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T22:21:04+00:00" title="September  4, 2008 10:21PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But then how do crossbows do any damage?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167181/#Comment_167181" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-05T03:49:16+00:00" title="September  5, 2008  3:49AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just noticed that Grey Ranks has no rules for diagonal (or orthogonal) character movement!
