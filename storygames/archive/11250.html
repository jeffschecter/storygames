We talked a little about the games we've seen, their good points and bad points, and a bit about my love for Italo-westerns, as well.  At which Potemkin said something quite interesting:\n<blockquote>I'd love a western game that lives on cinematic theory in the same way <i>PTA</i> lives off televisual tropes: describing camera shots, musical scores, mis-en-sc\xe8ne, etc., etc.</blockquote>\nYes, that <i>would</i> be a good game, wouldn't it?<br/><br/>The thing about Italo-westerns is that they're dripping with style.  Even the shitty, no-budget knockoffs that clot the bloodstream of the Italo-western period have managed to retain at least some of what made the greats by Leone and Corbucci such effective pieces of cinema.<br/><br/>For the most part western games seem to follow in the footsteps of <i>Boot Hill</i>, and the resultant product is far more reminiscent of <i>Gunsmoke</i> than it is of <i>Django</i>.  I'm not saying there's anything specifically wrong with this, but it's not the roleplaying experience I'm looking for when I say "western game."  There has to be a mechanism for rewarding the inclusion of cinematic style in order for a game to step up and become something truly different, otherwise both the games and the players will be content to do what they've always done, which is really only halfway there.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249968/#Comment_249968" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T13:14:02+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  1:14PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aren't all those tropes just color/narration?

Rather than just making it a matter of color, somehow coding into the game the <i>need</i> to describe the game in cinematic terms.  Perhaps even using those cinematic elements to one's advantage with extra dice, or what have you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253053/#Comment_253053" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T05:20:46+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  5:20AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite>Rather than just making it a matter of color, somehow coding into the game the<i>need</i>to describe the game in cinematic terms.
