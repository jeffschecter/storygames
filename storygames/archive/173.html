<p>4) Here is a guess, based on MF's stated goals.</p>
<p>The reward system is your usual WW attendance reward. It doesn't incentivise anything and it generates a resource that primarily generates boring stuff.</p>
<p>The <em>stunt</em> reward system generates small-scale rewards based more or less on sheer audacity. In neither case do the rewards make you care about p/r.</p>

                            I answer my own question: what the hell is up with the warstriders?  I mean honestly.  Mechs?  Sure, they're powerful, but they are not about personal power in the same way that innate charms or a big freakin sword can be.  And they have little-to-no traction on the responsibility side of the equation.  Be careful where you step, I think, is about as hard as the responsibility theme gets with the warstriders.                        </div>

                            I'll answer those questions separately and out of order, if I may.<blockquote>4) What is broken about Rewards?</blockquote>This is the biggest problem I have with the rules-as-published. The reward system is very straightforward: the longer you survive, the more Kewl Powerz you get. I want the players to be rewarded for addressing their thematic agendas, instead of for showing up to play and for keeping their characters alive.<p>The power level of the characters restricts the content of the story. It doesn't take all that many XP before any number of mortal beings with conventional equipment are no longer an interesting source of adversity. If the group isn't interested in taking on major governments single-handed, the system shouldn't sucker them into building their characters up to the point where what they <em>do</em> want to do becomes boringly easy.</p><p>(Switching to question 5 for a moment, I'd be happy to toss the XP rules as written, and probably the training-time rules as well, and just say that characters gain dots and Charms by group consensus.)</p><p>I want the players to be able to declare a thematic agenda using explicit, rules-endorsed cues, and to be rewarded for taking actions that address that agenda. I want the currency of that reward to be short-term advantage (bonus dice, say), rather than long-term advancement.</p> </div>

                            MF, do you want the playgroup as a whole to create one thematic agenda that they all address, or do you want individual players to create individual agendas that they individually address?  There's a big difference, once you get down to writing rules.                        </div>

<p>Are you really invested in this being problematic?</p>
<p>The way I see it, as XP increases, mortals become the focus of responsibility rather than the source of adversity. Adversity comes from yourself and your equals, while the pressure to maintain perspective and humanity comes from the people and places you love.</p>

<blockquote>3) What is broken about Virtue[s]?</blockquote>Let's do a cost/benefit analysis. The benefits:<ul><li>You can channel them for extra dice. That costs Willpower, which is the most precious resource on your character sheet, and gives you a dice bonus that is tiny in comparison to what you can get from even the simplest of Charms. Furthermore, you can't do it very often.</li><li>Temperance and Valor improve your character's resistance to certain magical effects that come into play fairly rarely.</li><li>Conviction determines the rate at which you regain Willpower.</li></ul>The costs:<ul><li>They give you Limit <em>and</em> drain your Willpower when your character behaves in a manner contradicting them. Having a high Valor is downright suicidal; high Compassion gets you in trouble around slavery, which is ubiquitous in the setting.</li><li>They increase the severity of a Limit Break.</li></ul>A sensible player will always buy up Conviction (especially) and Temperance (to a lesser degree), and leave Valor and Compassion at exactly 2. <em>So what</em> if you don't want to play a character who's ruthless, calculating, stoic and ascetic? Doing anything else incurs heavy penalties.<p>The particular selection of Virtues, along with the economy of Limit, appears to be intended to encourage characters who behave like the heroes of pulp fantasy and Greek mythology. However, the rules just don't work.</p> </div>

If it happens like a ticking timer, such that you can only have X number of play sessions in a given power bracket before getting kicked up to the next bracket willy-nilly, it sucks. I speak from experience here.<p>Josh:</p><blockquote>[D]o you want the playgroup as a whole to create one thematic agenda that they all address, or do you want individual players to create individual agendas that they individually address?</blockquote>The latter, I think, especially since you can easily go from the latter to the former by having everyone take the same thing as one of their thematic cues. Going the other way is much harder.<p>Also: warstriders are just toys. The problem isn't any particular kind of toy, it's a system that prioritizes the accumulation of toys over bold and passionate deeds.</p> </div>

                            Shreyas:<blockquote>Are you, at any point, expecting mortals to provide meaningful adversity?</blockquote>If the players want to start at the low end of the power scale, with characters who've only just experienced the Second Breath, then a company of elite soldiers led by a heroic mortal ought to be a threat they can't shrug off. Further up the power scale, armies should be tools in the hands of Exalted generals, used to delay and weaken their Exalted opponents.

I want the group as a whole to decide when to go from <q>save the village from bandits</q> to <q>bring down the corrupt king</q> to <q>raise an army to conquer the Realm</q>; I don't want them to have it decided for them by the XP clock.</p><p>Fortunately, I think the solution to <em>that</em> problem is a simple one, and I already discussed it.</p> </div>

<p>This is an artifact of the combat and Charms system, so it raises the question: Do you want to 'repair' the Exalted system so that it fulfils your goals, or rebuild from the ground up?</p>

                            It's a solved problem, Shreyas. It's easily fixed by ditching the reward system as written and replacing it with player consensus about advancement of power level. Can we please move on to the other issues I've raised?<p>Actually, can we please move <em>back</em> a bit, until I'm done articulating the goals I have in mind for this patch job?</p><p>Edit: Frankly, I would be surprised if the aforementioned sharp dividing line (Flow like Blood/Fivefold Bulwark Stance) survives into the forthcoming Second Edition. At the very least, I expect them to move those Charms up the tree a bit.</p> </div>

<p>Okay, so. Mortals remain a threat.</p>
<p>For combat, mortals cease to be dangerous when <em>scarcity of actions</em> ceases applying to Exalted. This hapens pretty sharply in defence and in a more graded fashion offensively. This isn't difficult to blend a bit (introduce scenelong defences that only provide some constant X defences per turn, which are required to gain access to the infinite defences, but beware of speedbumping here), but it is harder to eliminate.</p>
<p>For the non-combative realms, we do not have systems that determine how dangerous Exalted are and mortals aren't, so something needs to appear there.</p>

                            The excerpts of <cite>Exalted</cite> 2ed already released on the White Wolf website make it clear that they have introduced a Social Combat system which shares many mechanical elements with physical combat, so I expect the fixes necessary for the one will fix the other in the bargain.<p>One thing I <em>don't</em> want to do right now is hack up the Charm trees.

                            Well, I disagree on Armor, but I do agree that Exalted handles it poorly.  There should absolutely be HUGE, HEAVY armor in  PRIMARY COLORS  (or maybe BLACK) to mark a guy in armor as "Armor Guy".  <br/>
<br/>
Anything less than that? Yeah, to hell with it.  Everyone's gonna wear a buff jacket because there' so much mechanical benefit - why not just make that the baseline so we can go appropriately kung fu Conan?<br/>

<blockquote>2) What do you see the problem about power and responsibility now? Can't a good GM/group just work this into the game as is? Why not?</blockquote>The current system is the standard White Wolf incoherent Gamist/Sim mish-mash. It punishes players who build characters that don't go in one of a few specific directions by making them less capable of doing cool stuff than their fellow players. Because of this, the system imposes a judgment on the players' choice of themes. That's a Bad Thing and must be corrected.<p>Yeah, a group that's committed to a Narrativist agenda can accomplish it <em>in spite of</em> the published rules, by drifting the system. That is, in fact, what I'm trying to do here—but systematically, in advance, rather than piecemeal over the course of play.</p> </div>

<p>Exalted is broken for me too. I am not going to sling around jargon for why it is broken. There are a lot of aesthetic issues that I have to repair, but first:</p>
<p>I said in some other thread that the game gives you good tools for building crazy, over-the-top godkings, but then it doesn't really give you tools for <em>stuff you do</em> with godkings. I want to fix that.</p>

<p>Well, that's an odd question, 'cause I have spent a lot of time ripping up the messy bits of Exalted and bending them to do new things.</p>
<p>I'd rather like to keep a Charm-friendly system, and avoiding making me convert the Charms I want to use would be ideal. There's just no point in playing Exalted with HQ or some such system where actual, uh, exploration of system (gack i used jargon kill me now) is swept under the rug.</p>

                            Shadows of Yesterday, man. No rugging of crunch, there. As the three-corner magic system shows, you can get pretty damn complex subsystems out of Secrets. Just throw an Essence ability in for everyone, make some charm and sorcery Secrets, and you're good to go. It'd take a bit of work, but it'd leave plenty of room for exploration of system and kick plenty of ass.<br/>
<br/>
The conversion would take some effort though. I think someone was working on it over on RPG.Net a week or two ago; if you decide to go this route, and can dig up the thread, it might save you a bunch of the gruntwork.                        </div>

<p>Also I don't have good intuitions about the system so I'd have a needlessly hard time working out Charms.</p>
<p>To give the discussion some direction, suppose that we <em>do</em> choose to jury-rig the Virtues system to do what it does, but better. That is to say, it influences characters to act in striking, over-the-top, emotional ways. How would we make that drive play?</p>

<p>First and foremost, tie them to the reward system. Hell, the one that comes bundled in with the book does fuckall, so just make it so that Virtues <em>are</em> the reward system.</p>
<p>Somehow. I'd say make 'em function like Spiritual Attributes from TROS, but that gets a bit screwy when you bring spirit charms into the equation.</p>

                            Shreyas, first off, a sort of design-check question: are the game of becoming god-kings and the game of being god-kings really the same game?  Would this be better approached by using a sort of two-teir system where you use Exalted as-written or lightly house ruled to become utter badasses and then switching over to something else (something more like Nobilis) when the game 'shifts' from the process of becoming into the act of being?<br/><br/>You're a pretty visual-leaning kind of guy.  Pull out Illustrator and rework the character sheet with the Virtues at the top center of the page, see what that does for you.  See what you change on the sheet.  Cause my casual thought is immediately to replace Attributes with the Virtues, and run with it from there.<br/><br/>Lastly, Exalted's high crunch-factor is almost entirely a morally-indifferent set of rules.  Not only does using a charm have no moral resonance, but what you use the charm for does not have any moral repercussions as reinforced by the system.  Given that one of the schticks of the god-kings is that they use their godawful powers in ways that they perhaps shouldn't have, I would think that you'd need to somehow key in use-of-charms to somehow reflecting on should-you-have-done-that.                        </div>

<p>I did a conversion like that, once upon a time. Silly of me to overlook it.</p>
<p>A two-tiered system, hm. Well, this works well if you don't mind an abrupt transition, right; what do you suggest if you're expecting a transitional period where you are balancing the demands of amassing greatness and being the master of your world?</p>
<p>Third point: <strong>hm.</strong> This bears thinking about.</p>

<code>what do you suggest if you're expecting a transitional period where you are balancing the demands of amassing greatness and being the master of your world?</code><br/><br/>A two-tiered system with transition rules!  I mean, fundamentally we're talking about a long-term game that's meant to be played over the course of many sessions.  The early sessions will be about survival and amassing power; the middle sessions will be about amassing power and confronting global/universal conflicts, and the last sessions will be about confronting those massive conflicts and dabbling in transhumanism.<br/><br/>So you'd need to embed some metric into the characters/campaign that decides what sorts of rules you have access to.  Think of like, way-old D&amp;D where the upper character levels had you picking up a castle and retainers and knights and shit.  A very clumsy example, but you get the idea.  Set up the system so that, at the start you must or are only able to focus on survival and amassing power, then the survival eases up and you're able to address larger-scale problems (that probably drove your survival conflicts before) while still amassing power, and then when your power-amassing infrastructure can basically work on automatic (if that needs to be unpacked, tell me), you finish off your confrontations and look forward to what sort of world it will be once you've vanquished the big bads.<br/><br/><em>Exalted</em> as printed notably only has rules applicable to the first stage where survival and power-mongering are important, begins to break down in that middle range, and offers hardly any support for the last stage.  If you recall <em>Mage</em>, it had the same problem, and the <em>Masters of the Art</em> book attempted and failed to address it -- they didn't want to face the simple fact that the game was about playing neophyte-to-middling-experience mages.                        </div>

                            See Shreays, I feel almost exactly the opposite. <br/><br/>What power does to you is, at this point in my life, generally more interesting than what getting power does to you. <br/><br/>Perhaps because I've had a lot of chance to play with the second, and little enough to play with the first.                        </div>

                            My only problem about games regarding the exercise of power -- especially on a grand scale -- is that they are pretty much conjecture on the part of the players at the table.  This is why I despair of a good <em>West Wing</em> RPG -- everybody contributing to the consequences of character action would have to have a thorough grounding in Washington politics, and even then people's biases would be coloring what they suggested and ratified.<br/><br/>Could you make an interesting story?  Sure.  Could you analyze the use and abuse of power?  Not really.  At best you can analyze the use and abuse of power <em>as seen by the players</em>.                        </div>

                            Brand -- while yes, I agree that this is all you ever really can do, I find games of this stripe to hit this 'ceiling' faster and harder than games with a more modest scope.  When the game is about passing judgment on difficult moral situations (Dogs), proving you're worth the power you've been given (Capes), or expressing character in a fantastic setting (FLFS), the players' subjectivity does come up, certainly, but it does not come up as often or have as significant of an impact on play.  When the game is <em>about</em> consequences, rather than choices, it's that much more obvious that the "consequences" are actually hypothetical conjectures.                        </div>
