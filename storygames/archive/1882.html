                    I love Shadow of Yesterday for campaign play. It hits all my chords for fantasy gaming, and when it doesn't, it has two features that equalize it back to my needs.<br/><br/>I have this spiel I give to people who haven't played it, and I've been urged to write it up and explain it. Here's the spiel:<br/><br/><i>"You know why Shadow of Yesterday is so freakin' cool? You look through a list of roleplaying styles, find the one that matches you best, and you get XP for playing it out! And, guess what, when you've spent your wad on getting Hack 'n' slash XP or Political Backstabbing XP, just make a change in your character and BOOM! Now you get TWO new things for your character, whether it be some Kewl Power or a Play Style or whatever it is that you want. And, get this, this isn't going to happen in any game. Say you homebrewed up a Play Style to get XP for, but it isn't working out right. It happened to me. So, not only do I get to correct this by getting rid of the Play Style, I get rewarded for it. Make a mistake in feat selection in D&amp;D and try to correct it and see what happens; getting XP isn't going to be included in there</i> anywhere. <i>Self correcting mechanics, that's why I love Shadow of Yesterday!</i><br/><br/>By this time, I've either got them hooked wherein I explain the options for player created content or they've run away screaming for mommy. Actually, the latter has never happened. So, here's the real life behind it all:<br/><br/>We (Eric, Lisa, Ulysses and I) were playing in a steampunky world of Eric's overarching design. We had originally played D&amp;D3.5 for about three sessions with a modified system to allow for Conflict Resolution and for Eric to throw any challenge level at us fairly. Still, we didn't groove too well and I was lost in books trying to find something cool for me to do unsuccessfully.<br/><br/>We ported over to Shadow of Yesterday. Eric had us find what was most important about our characters and we would translate those features over. I struggled to find anything on my character sheet that made me feel excited. The only thing I could find was <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ps/20060306a" rel="nofollow">my class</a> - and it wasn't the class features, it was just my idea of the class:
<blockquote><cite>Wizards.com</cite><br/>In essence, the binder goes through a ritual to summon a special spirit called a vestige. This might involve certain special conditions ... Then the binder and spirit take some time to strike a bargain--the pact. This can be roleplayed based on the personality of the spirit </blockquote>
So, we discussed what I wanted out of the kewl power. Did I want it to just happen, or did I want varying success? Did I want to be challenged by Spirit Binding, or have a reliable but costly power?<br/><br/>I opted for varying success with challenge. So, now I have the flavor and the mechanic. My skill would tell me how powerful a spirit I ended up getting to negotiate with, and what power that spirit would give me.<br/><br/>Also, I was able to make it generalized. I wouldn't be the host for the spirit (even though it would be giving me dice to use in conflicts) and had to find items worthy of its presence or items it could consume to make its host better. In the course of gaming, I got to do my thing with spirits twice and was happy with the scenes that came out of both.<br/><br/>So, the other bit of player created content actually leads into the self correcting mechanic (on the Key side, at least). I couldn't find a Key that I wanted so I left the XP around so I could buy one when it hit me. We were playing a christening for the airship that I had bound with a spirit. Lisa and Ulysses were having a ball, literally. I hid in the shadows and let them take all the compliments for the ship. I realized that this was fun play for me. Eric and I quickly came up with a Key for use next session. Here it was:<br/><br/>Key of Modesty<br/>Accomplish something and deny credit (1 XP). <b>Make everyone believe</b> it was somebody else (3 XP). Buyoff: Take credit for a deed and ham it up.<br/><br/>See the bolded part? I was specifically playing a non-social character; that part was a mistake. I even bound a spirit to get some social skills and I still couldn't pull it off. We all figured out it wasn't working out for me and should be rewritten. But then, there I was, having accomplished the greatest spirit deed I'd ever done ...  I walked amongst the ruins with spirit eyes, having brought forth a millennium old village and walked on its street for an evening. I came back to the group and everyone knew what was going to happen. I'd have to reveal what I'd learned through someone else and get them to take credit for it while denying credit. Except, I didn't. I broke out of my shell, and told a great story.<br/><br/>And banked 10 XP for it. Two advances, two powers, skills or keys -- for fixing the problem! In game! Self freaking correcting mechanics!<br/><br/>I love Shadow of Yesterday.                </div>

<p>I'm totally digging our TSOY game.  Porting over from D&amp;D was a little bit bumpy at first, but I think that it worked well because TSOY just fit the way that we really wanted to play.</p>
<p>I'm only maybe a little dissapointed in the lack of guidance to the GM for statting out NPCs and beasties.  It's not that it's terribly hard, but I would have loved to know how to stat out an NPC quickly to different scales the very first time we played.</p>
<p>I'm really looking forward to our next session.  With the Flight Mistress ousted, there's gonna be some crazy-ass chaos in Alderoo.  Also, what do those little winged guys want from your character and her new lover?  And just how is that other shadow dude gonna react?</p>
<p>Yeah.  Totally looking forward to it.</p>

Yeah, Eric threw me for a loop. He directly hit against my Key of Sorority with Lisa's character by having an NPC ask me to escape the coup d'etat with him (and leave the object of my Key). And I wanted to do it because as a player it sounded so awesome. So I said, BAM! (I think) and startled everyone. I took Key of Love for the NPC to, and I quote, "make this pay me in XP!" And off we went, destroying our airship and crash landing in the middle of uncharted territory ...                        </div>

                            Awesome introduction, Mark - it really makes me want to play the game. 'Course, i've already taken the free version of the rules, formatted them and printed out a little booklet for myself, so i'm probably already sold. But everyone just seems so enthusiastic about TSOY &amp; the Solar System!                        </div>

                            Both Lisa and Ulysses ended up creating Secrets based on their D&amp;D powers. A lot of what was cool about our characters were easily picked up with pre-existing Keys and Abilities (skills?).                        </div>

<p>If I recall correctly, we made up almost all the Secrets that everyone started with, porting the characters' powers over from D&amp;D.  The Keys, on the other hand, almost all came from the TSOY book.  I think everyone's Abilities, except their combat stuff, came from the book.</p>
<p>The really tricky part was the Secrets.  Their characters in their D&amp;D incarnations had so many powers.  Mostly piddly little powers, and mostly all attached to a single theme, but still lots of little powers.  I didn't want our first game of TSOY to be cluttered up with tons of secrets for everyone to remember, so I encouraged everyone to just talk about the <em>important</em> supernatural powers of their characters.  Once we were able to distill what was cool &amp; important about the characters we were able to write up maybe one or two secrets for each character that fulfilled the cool &amp; important criteria.</p>
<p>All of which turned out to be totally awesome in play.</p>
<p>Hey Mark, why don't you talk about how playing your character changed from the D&amp;D incarnation to the TSOY incarnation?  I mean, we did all that porting in a really interesting situation.  Not only had all the PCs been played using the D&amp;D rules, but we were totally mid-scene when the port took place.  I know from my perspective at the table, the pacing and flavor of the game changed significantly.  Like a bunch of heavy chains being cut free.  But I'm just the GM.  I think it would be twice the awesome to hear about how it affected your character, her story, and how you play her.</p>

                            I roleplay with two methods, depending on where I am in a scene. If I'm looking to frame a scene or enter a scene, I look at my character sheet and find something on there that relates so that my presence will have focus, whether that be powers, alignment, keys, secrets, or whatever. Once I'm in a scene, I try to stick to only Alignment, Keys, and previous established actions to guide my character. Once I've recognized a challenge of some sort, then I try to find an answer with other things on my sheet (I really distinguish, maybe too heavily, between roleplaying and challenges/puzzle solving.)<br/><br/>Given that, my character had a NE alignment (Evil supposedly being the selfish, N being hating of the law that previously bound her, yet not wanting to bring chaos to her people.) The front of my D&amp;D character sheet shows my Alignment, a Cutlass, and Meta Points (Eric's creation - author something, up to and including your own survival despite your HP stating otherwise). I have some skills. These are my active parts - things I can actively use or make framing statements with. I can call for a skill test, spend a Meta Point to author, etc.. Saves, stats, AC, those are reflexive parts - parts I'll only need when responding to something else. So, when roleplaying Eva, given how I roleplay above, I could make a statement with my alignment (be selfish, comment on how the previous slave owners were bad, etc.), author a new element into the game world, or attack something.<br/><br/>For example: Lisa and Ulysses' characters are discussing how they are going to get to Alderoo and feel that the best way is to convince the Airship Armada to allow us to go with. I look at my character sheet: Alignment: Don't trust organization, do something on your own. Skill tests: Bluff, Sense Motive. Attack - not a good option right now. So, I decide to go find another airship captain that can take us on my own. This is in direct violation of a D&amp;D trope - I put myself in danger by going alone to someplace. This just screams 'attack or ambush me', and that's what ended up happening.<br/><br/>Later on, after conversion I might have approached this differently. I might have bargained with a spirit to find us a ship (Ability - Spirit Binding). I might have contacted slaves like myself to see what was going on (Key of the Mission - Pull a Moses). Either way, the result would have been completely different. It would have been character focused and wouldn't require that Eric launch some attack against me. Bad decisions can become great stories and not story enders.<br/><br/>Also, because Shadow of Yesterday doesn't require killing people to win conflicts, it makes acts like murder return back to their place as a hard decision and a bad thing. Now, when Ulysses' character decides that someone has to die, it has an impact on me.                        </div>

This is one of the things I really love about TSOY.  My character (who up until now has been a bit of a healer/peacenik) just took the Key of Vengeance, and the fact that she wants to kill this guy is HUGE.  For one, because she's thus far been pretty against killing and death, but also because the body count in this game has been astonishingly low.  We've defeated major NPCs and taken 'em out of play, but I don't think we've actually killed any named NPCs, and the game's been going since August.  So to tell you the truth, killing this guy kind of freaks me out, not because it's going to be a dangerous conflict, but because it's going to have a major impact on my character and on the game.                        </div>

                            Mark - That's it. That's exactly it - you need to have handles to give you a hold on your character, and the Keys, and Secrets too, look like they do a great job of doing just that.<br/>I played in an Exalted game over the summer, and i was completely flailing about, unable to figure out what to do in each scene. I had all sorts of abilities, but not anything i saw as a handle. I guess my character didn't fit the game, and there was no way to change it.<br/><br/>Kirsten - That's so cool.                        </div>

I know that experience all too well. Scene framing should be a consideration here, though. If you've got all combat abilities, scenes with social discourse will either fail or hit combat rather quickly.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sempiternity</cite>I played in an Exalted game over the summer, and i was completely flailing about, unable to figure out what to do in each scene. I had all sorts of abilities, but not anything i saw as a handle. I guess my character didn't fit the game, and there was no way to change it.</blockquote>
I had a similar experience a few months ago, also with Exalted. It kinda demonstrated the failure of trad games for me. I had a social character with lots of social and non-combat charms, and a simple conversation had me flummoxed. The GM wouldn't just let me fall back on rolling dice, but I didn't quite have the tools I needed to navigate the situation. It was like have a bunch of different size Phillips screwdrivers when all I needed was a simple flathead.                        </div>

<p>So, uh, this sounds to me like the GM in question wasn't actually following the rules as-written. Can you really blame Exalted or trad games as a whole for your GM's transgression here?</p>

                            I don't - in my case i know i had at least most of the tools i needed to get the job done, i just couldn't figure out how to use them. I think using just the descriptive labels notion from Jonathan's Anathema combined with regular Exalted mechanics might really help. <br/><br/>(Although difficulty with scene setting was probably also a contributor to my problems...)                        </div>
