One aspect of the game, as written, that has always seemed overly complicated is the note passing to describe secret actions and secret communications. Now I understand why the game was written to include player v. player secrets (to inspire paranoia), but I was wondering how much that design comes from an assumption that players would have trouble resisting the urge to use player knowledge to determine character actions. <br/><br/>In an era where lots of people play Fiasco and other games that rely on players putting their own characters in terrible spots, isn't it reasonable to run Paranoia the same way [1]? Isn't it likely that players will have more fun and get into more absurd situations if they can see many of the internal conflicts ahead of time? <br/><br/>If someone has actually tried this, I'd love to hear about it. I'm perfectly willing to believe that it doesn't run as well as I'm suggesting. <br/><br/>[1] In complete fairness, I think there is actually a fan-made Paranoia playset for Fiasco                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451763/#Comment_451763" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-04T04:57:00+00:00" title="March  4, 2016  4:57AM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We executed a perfect Paranoia campaign last summer in Helsinki, so I might have a few opinions on this. I'll describe how I handled these matters to give some context as to where I'm coming from:<br/><br/>My premise as the GM was that Paranoia is a challengeful game of conspiracy and bureaucracy (this view is contrasted by the opinion that it is, at its heart, a GM's burlesque performance piece), and therefore it is of utmost importance to foster an environment of asymmetrical knowledge and uncertainty. Therefore I naturally supported note-passing; every player got, as part of the "standard troubleshooter equipment kit", a little notebook they could use for the purpose. (A notebook is superior to loose-leaf paper, as it makes long back-and-forth dialogues easier to follow.)<br/><br/>The only compromise I made in this regard was the "hear no evil" rule: because the space we played in was somewhat small, private dialogues were held in the same room with the rest of play, and therefore it was technically possible to overhear private conversations. My solution to this was to mandate that the troublehooters should, while waiting for private exchanges to finish, read instructive passages aloud from the troubleshooter's little red book to each other. Should you nevertheless overhear something not diegetically intended for your character's ears, admitting to such knowledge would be considered treasonous.<br/><br/>While on the topic, I should note that part of effective note-passing playstyle is a) to develop a powerful short-hand, and b) to read notes expansively and with imagination. Players should be able to have their characters execute complex maneuvers with short notes, as long as the GM is willing and able to make constructive assumptions about the covert actions the characters take. A powerful conflict resolution rules system is very much of use as well here - it's quite useful if you can ask the players to input some dice rolling results into their notes in more complex situations.<br/><br/>-- So, against that background it probably comes as no surprise if I say that in my opinion this is probably not the whole truth of the matter:\n<blockquote>In an era where lots of people play Fiasco and other games that rely on players putting their own characters in terrible spots, isn't it reasonable to run Paranoia the same way? Isn't it likely that players will have more fun and get into more absurd situations if they can see many of the internal conflicts ahead of time?</blockquote>\nI agree that it is likely that this approach is <i>functional</i>, but I don't think that it's necessarily <i>more fun</i>. It's just a different kind of game altogether - the kind of Paranoia you suggest is not as tense, and the players are there largely to observe the proceedings and have wacky hijinks. Specifically, without hidden knowledge there is no real reward cycle in promotions and secret society plotting, which means that the players do not have strategic goals, per se - the game becomes a comic story game of a particularly non-dramatic type. This may be preferable to some tastes, but I don't think that it's obviously better than taking the game's paranoid premise seriously.<br/><br/>Historically Paranoia is a schizophrenic game with two main logical strands, as I alluded to in the beginning: either you think that the game is about fucking over the other characters to secure a promotion for yourself, or you think that the game is about enjoying the GM's carefully prepped satirical farce with its ludicrous NPCs and laughable situations. Removing the secrets is a perfectly reasonable approach for the latter style of play, while it would remove the entire raison d'etre for the former.<br/><br/>(I should note that the game has a rich history of commercial, ready-to-play adventure modules. These are nearly without exception in support of the farcical interpretation of the base game. Of the various editions of the rules, the 1st leaned towards gamist challenge game, the 2nd was about farcical GM performance, and 3rd was reasonably even-handed in catering to both. As is often the case with old games, Paranoia is by no means clear-cut in what it is even trying to do.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/uolmir" title="uolmir"><img alt="uolmir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/uolmir">uolmir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451764/#Comment_451764" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-04T06:14:06+00:00" title="March  4, 2016  6:14AM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>the kind of Paranoia you suggest is not as tense, and the players are there largely to observe the proceedings and have wacky hijinks.

Everybody already knows you're a traitor, so why not give them all the details and have fun watching them <i>prove</i> it? I once had a character who was undercover IntSec, which when you accounted for his normal and secret society identity meant he had three personas, which he sometimes lost track of, while in the confessional booth.<br/><br/>ZAP!<br/><br/>Another character I played was given the passcode 1234, but I would have them enter 4321 by  mistake. Acquiring a can of red paint was a license for chaos. Screaming about how the alarms (birds) were constantly chirping outdoors meant it was dangerous, because why would birds lie?<br/><br/>Pure joy.<br/><br/>Paranoia is also a satire on the toxic gaming behaviors of old, like those cultivated by Tomb of Horrors. I never found this part to be fun, and I believe the newest edition (which I reserve judgment on) ditches most of it. Avoiding the inevitable disasters is just boring. Players playing 'protectively' is just boring. If you're not deliberately creating irony and misunderstandings, you're not playing <i>my</i> Paranoia.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
