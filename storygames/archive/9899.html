I love the subtle satire of/respect for the over-the-top xenocidal war genre (if that's actually a legitimate genre) and the clean play mechanics are like rules candy.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow here's the weird bit. It wasn't until I accidentally stumbled onto my 10th glowing rave-post about this game that I finally, grudgingly, decided to peek more closely at it and the reason that I had resisted up until then? The cover. Yup... that slick cover with it's serious typeface made me go "ho-hum" and take no further notice of the thing. Ironically, the art inside the game is near-perfect -- raw and scribbly and exactly what this sort of game is about, not the lovely but emotionally sterile cover art. Go figure.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, none of this is to rank on the cover artist, because the work is very nice and yet, to me, it does nothing to sell what the game is really about - not the tone, not the brutality of the thing, or the humor, etc. etc.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220056/#Comment_220056" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T07:02:50+00:00" title="July 22, 2009  7:02AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is hard to undersestimate how much work it is to get a game together. There are so many niggly little steps, cover art being only one of them. I suspect most of us are not talented marketers so getting the packaging just right is a trial and error and error and error and error process. When I'm making my own stuff I fall in love with it and become totally lacking in objectivity. When I realize I've made a misshaped monster and have to kill it it is like killing my baby but to get people to open the game it must be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nI played the new Arkham Horror boardgame last weekend because it looked pretty. I own a copy of the original Chaosium game from the 80's and knew it had play problems. I hoped that the new prettyness would make that better. Sadly the system problems were still there and the pretty wasn't enough to make me want to play it again. So games have to be pretty but they also have to be good. <br/>\n<br/>\nBoy! How hard can this get? Not only do we give ourselves the task of making kickass games but then we have to compete with professional artists and companies with actual resources to put into projects to make something which the mainstream gamer will then negatively compare to the lastest Euro Game from China. Sheer determination and insane presistence is needed to make this work. Good thing I have that in droves.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle<br/>\nhamsterpress.net                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220062/#Comment_220062" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T07:37:54+00:00" title="July 22, 2009  7:37AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I laid out the cover for my newest creation last night at a rather late hour, so I sympathize.

Great topic and great timing too.<br/><br/><a href="http://tiny.cc/sRYOP" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://gregorhutton.com/boxninja/threesixteen/art/316img400.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>I totally get where you are coming from, Neil.<br/><br/>However, I disagree and I guess that having designed the cover that's a given. :-) Anyway, just to say that I feel the cover does a good job of saying this is a game about Military SF (Space Marines/Starship Troopers/40K but not so close to be sued). I mean it's just blowing planets to shit. I always show people who're new to the game the cover and I say: this is it. You're assaulting a planet! See?! Drop ships! And you can see the lights still on in the cities on the surface -- they'll soon be snuffed out soon! Let's go!<br/><br/>Is it too slick? Maybe? I see your point. But I pondered <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16181" rel="nofollow">carry: a game about war</a>'s cover and interior and I like to think 3:16 is its mirror. For a long time I wanted to do the book like a Bible, a bit like how carry is a field manual (and doesn't get enough love for how cool and actually practically useful it is). But in the end I wanted it to have a little <em>distance</em> from grim reality. (And God or religion doesn't appear anywhere in the book at all, that's deliberate) I do think the cool, detached drop-ships in space image does that.<br/><br/>By the way, I feel that the interior art, which is quite gritty and abstract, shows the other side of the coin. (So, I'm glad that hit buttons for you since they're mine!) Cooking the Lt's pig, fighting cock-monsters, a nuke! and so on. Some people have disagreed with the interior art (notably Jez Gray who went on to change his mind and give it a <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/14/14200.phtml" rel="nofollow">5/5 RPGnet review</a>) and that's all fine, different strokes for different folks.<br/><br/>As David says it's up for <a href="http://www.ennie-awards.com/nominations/09coverart.asp" rel="nofollow">Best Cover in the ENnies</a>. I'm thrilled about that and you all should <strong>vote for it!</strong> (Well, except Neil who is excused!)<br/><br/>I like the whole (front/spine/back) cover design actually, and I think it's pretty tight (though I do find it ironic to be up for the Best Cover when I think the strongest thing about the game is the way it plays). Anyway, I was talking with the artist Paul Bourne about how he made the cover and he came up with this:\n<blockquote>The image for the cover of 3:16 was made in 3 separate stages, each stage being created on its own and brought together to create the final image. Firstly, I modelled a 3D mesh missile in 3DS. I tried to keep the missile as detailed as possible as, at this point, I was unsure how big the missiles would be in the final image.<br/> <br/>The missile was then taken into Bryce 6.1 where it was textured and shaded. The missile was then lit from above with a white spotlight to simulate sunlight, as well as a blue area light underneath to simulate ambient light reflecting from the planet. I then glue the missile and lights together so that they could be copied and arranged into a basic composition. <br/> <br/>The planet was created using 2 mesh spheres: 1 slightly smaller sphere inside the other. The outer sphere was textured with a semi-transparent cloud texture and a 'fuzzy' filter to represent a basic atmosphere, the inner with the blue planet texture. The finished planet model was then brought together with the missile compostion and rendered against a plain black background.<br/> <br/>The render was then taken into Photoshop were the green gas clouds and stars were added. To complete the image I added the city lights and a bit more atmosphere to the planet.<br/><br/>Finally, the lense blooms were added to the missile engines and the explosion effect overlayed on to the planet.</blockquote>\nI think that's pretty insane and a cool thing. Between the initial cover image and the final one Paul moved some of the drop ships (since they're suspended in space as a 3-d model) -- and I have an image of a drop ship on its own somewhere too. I should put the word around about this.<br/><br/>And, hey, thanks for the feedback and I hope you enjoy playing the game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kakupacal" title="kakupacal"><img alt="kakupacal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kakupacal">kakupacal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220134/#Comment_220134" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T11:22:12+00:00" title="July 22, 2009 11:22AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2009 11:22AM by kakupacal.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And as I work in the Department of Redundancy Department I just want to say again that the current cover art is really swell...

Me... I'm on the other half. I love the whole package: cover art, interior art, the game itself. It's a gem. But it's really cool to hear the other side of the story. And even cooler that the other side stumbled on to the game anyway and will get a chance to try it. <br/><br/>One recommendation I have for any fresh recruits to 3:16 - play out more than one or two missions. The game ripens as you go and as players get into what Gregor has crafted. It's fun at first, then it gets under your skin and becomes, well... even more fun. Don't be fooled by the ease of pick-up use, don't be fooled by the simplicity of the moving parts. It delivers a surprisingly sophisticated and deep role-play experience if you let it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kakupacal" title="kakupacal"><img alt="kakupacal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kakupacal">kakupacal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220284/#Comment_220284" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T08:52:23+00:00" title="July 23, 2009  8:52AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm very happy for the game getting attention due to the cover... my post was mostly about the irony of it all, that the award-winning cover is what made me pass on looking at the thing in the first place. I'm contrary like that!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had been in control of creating the cover, I would have gone with an updated WW2 propaganda poster... the same "rally to arms" kinda thing that made those so iconic but with more sinister/jingoistic tones to it.
