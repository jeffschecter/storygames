I will try not to share things before I think it might be worth people's time to peruse.    <br/><br/>So far I've shared "The Palimpsest Device" here, which I still think is a fun idea, but which was not much enjoyed by the two people who tried it with me...  The playtest revealed a mechanical flaw that is very fixable.  The bigger issue is that the two players I was with just didn't like the basic idea of it <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> <br/><br/>I will be playtesting some of these games in our Seattle meetup group:  RPG Workshop.  Although I've been engrossed in the creative endeavor of making games and sometimes excited and delighted with ideas that strike me... I'm not at all convinced that what I come up with is at all the kind of thing that people in general want to spend their time playing.  But I'll continue to complete a few more of my babies and kill even more no doubt.  <br/><br/>The OUIJA game above is more of a thought experiment that exists to give expression to the central conceit (and mechanic).  The same could be said of "The Palimpsest Device".  Maybe gimmick is my shtick.    I should go back to it and see about buffing out some of the world and character creation rules make it more fully formed as a story game.  <br/><br/>I'll link palimpsest below in a separate comment.  <br/><br/>-Davey                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470076/#Comment_470076" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-19T02:57:07+00:00" title="February 19, 2018  2:57AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And here's "The Palimpsest Device"<br/>FYI:  The mechanical flaws include:  The Time Traveler will sometimes coincide with the Inventor Role.  The fix involves just getting rid of the idea that the Time Traveler doesn't exist in the upcoming scene (after the time travel vignettes).  It turned out that the GM like role I had in mind for the Time Traveler wasn't much utilized anyway.   The Rock Paper Scissors part will also be cut as an extra and unnecessary layer.  I just love Rochambeau and wanted to squeeze it in even though it didn't really fit.  Maybe I'll just have to make another game that makes R.P.S. a central mechanic somehow.  Maybe a voting mechanic for scene resolution???<br/><br/>Anyhow, here is the game I mentioned:<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MKFVZQ8wNUOUY9iSKJgaIzOx76a0wIRoAFC9HWzkhQ4/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MKFVZQ8wNUOUY9iSKJgaIzOx76a0wIRoAFC9HWzkhQ4/edit?usp=sharing</a><br/><br/>Thx,<br/>Davey<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chiarina" title="chiarina"><img alt="chiarina" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chiarina">chiarina</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470078/#Comment_470078" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-19T05:02:42+00:00" title="February 19, 2018  5:02AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/davey" rel="nofollow">davey</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Are there other OUIJA board based RPG games?<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nThe other Ouija board based game I know is "The society of dreamers" by Matthijs Holter.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470083/#Comment_470083" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-19T09:23:38+00:00" title="February 19, 2018  9:23AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also wrote a short game which includes what is best described as a <a href="http://groundhoggth.blogspot.co.uk/2015/10/phasmagraph.html" rel="nofollow">Ouija board simulator</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470084/#Comment_470084" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-19T09:52:41+00:00" title="February 19, 2018  9:52AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/davey" rel="nofollow">davey</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Here's a game I wrote a while back.

As an almost-permanent GM though, I'm not sure how I feel about dying offstage before the game begins... ;-)<br/><br/>The most overwhelming impression I get is that this is an invitation to go over-the-top, solid gold, screaming gonzo: there don't seem to be any brakes or steering here, you just get pushed down the slope from the top of the hill and the game will meet you again at the bottom.<br/><br/>A lot of foreknowledge of seances and the Ouija board is assumed throughout, which might be reasonable for the expected target audience of this game: there are <i>tons</i> of things to be said about the subject, but it's difficult to say how much you should include here. The short passage about using the planchette is probably enough for most, but might be mystifying to others.<br/><br/>I'm not 100% sure I'd play this... it could be fun, but I've played other games where you 're-create' a lost adventure through improvisation (<b>Cheat Your Own Adventure</b> occupies similar territory) and that goal married to the Ouija-mechanics just jars with me. I like the idea of the mock seance as a game resolution mechanic, but using that to construct a theoretical game sessions seems trivial: the game system could do much better things!<br/><br/>As an aside, I know of at least one chamber larp which takes place during a seance: I'm tempted to suggest using this game to create the final session of that one, but I'm afraid it might signal the beginning of the Metapocalypse! ;-)<br/><br/>As a further aside, if you want a space to discuss and present new game designs, perhaps even get playtesters, then I moderate the <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/101198500058433217625" rel="nofollow">Games on Trial</a> community on G+ which does just that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470092/#Comment_470092" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-19T19:33:28+00:00" title="February 19, 2018  7:33PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Chiarina and James<br/>Society of dreamers looks super cool. It seems like an investigation game that may well have skirted some of the big difficulties of that genre...  plus the theme and basic story idea is right up my alley.<br/><br/>Thanks for linking your game James. I\u2019m gonna read it today. Yes, my game as written has very little in the way of brakes (as you say).  If I do decide to refine and playtest it, I\u2019ll post results here.<br/><br/>I\u2019m thinking of fiasco right now. That\u2019s also a game w very little mechanics to guide the story. But it works. I\u2019m wondering what I could add that wouldn\u2019t overly complicate the game. <br/><br/>I\u2019ll check out \u201ccheat your own adventure too\u201d. I\u2019ve heard of it, but don\u2019t really know anything about it yet.   <br/><br/>I\u2019ve got an idea for making a maglev OUIJA!!  I have looked on the inter webs and have only found one example  it used an unusual property of bismuth, which is a really cool element. Apparently for reasons I\u2019ve already forgotten, it repels both positive and negative charges. Maybe like a vanderwaals force in reverse, if you remember that from chemistry class;). Maybe not...  either way, too expensive. I\u2019m wondering if I can drill a bunch of holes in a piece of plywood, epoxy in little neodymium magnet discs, then attach a OUIJA to the top and put more magnets on each of the planchettes 3 legs. I can\u2019t predict how the field will work surrounding the board. Might be too bumpy, might just push planchette to the edge. The fact that I haven\u2019t found it online coupled w the obviousness of the idea may mean its doomed from the start.  But it\u2019d be really fun if it actually worked. <br/><br/>Thx again,<br/>Davey.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470198/#Comment_470198" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-24T04:35:49+00:00" title="February 24, 2018  4:35AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James, Thanks for pointing me to your OUIJA board simulator.  How have sessions gone?  I can imagine having fun w it.  I have a few questions but if you don\u2019t want to entertain them I am totally fine with that. After all you did not solicit any feedback I don\u2019t think...  <br/><br/>I am thinking the card rank = word length mechanic might be a bit like a crossword puzzle challenge and I\u2019m wondering what that limitation does to the emergence of an engrossing story.  Maybe it\u2019d work really well.   I am also wondering how it might differ if people actually use a OUIJA board.  You didn\u2019t include \u201crules\u201d for that option, but since it generates letter sequences (words) in a very different way, you might get very different results. <br/><br/>I have to admit, I drew up the OUIJA game I shared above without ever going back to the board and trying it out again. I remember vividly how it did in fact work for us in our youth. I wonder if it will work for my friends and I as more jaded adults. My lack of confidence in our ability to surrender our defenses is the driver of my interest in making a maglev board (as described in a post above).

Phasmagraph falls into the latter category, so I'm happy to answer questions about it, but I still haven't managed to get it to table: so many games, so little time.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
