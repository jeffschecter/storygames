Here's an idealised version of the Script I used yesterday during a playtest at the London Indie Meetup:<br/>\n<br/>\n"Interview Commences at 3.13am, 17th December 1973, in Conference Room B of Greater Manchester Police Headquarters; interview conduced by DI Wallace and witnessed by PC McDouglas"<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Leading Question</b>: "I'm sorry to have to conduct the interview under these conditions, but I'm sure you understand the urgency of getting to the bottom of these events; the doctors have confirmed that you are stable and lucid and I've requested some pain killers for you... now, the first thing I need to clear up is your presence in the remains of the bank; can you state your name, age and occupation, for the record, and clarify what you were doing there at that time of night?"<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Key Points</b>:<br/>\nWhat was behind the door?<br/>\nWhere did the body go?<br/>\nWhy was the book stolen?<br/>\nHow did the wall fall down?<br/>\nWhen did Mr. Lithgo leave?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'd like now are some more sample scripts following this model: its important to note that this is the only information the Script should provide, it is not a scenario and 99% of the facts of the incident should come from the witness statements. Also, one question that may not be asked by the Key Points is 'Who', as this may tend to contradict some of the mechanics of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you in advance!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333744/#Comment_333744" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-10T10:54:25+00:00" title="July 10, 2011 10:54AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James, very neat!<br>Is there a Closing Statement?                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333749/#Comment_333749" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-10T12:01:23+00:00" title="July 10, 2011 12:01PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Closure depends on a) how the players respond to the questions posed by the Interviewer and b) which of them has accrued the most Suspicion at the end of the game. The rules-document is almost ready to post on my website, it just needs a few sample scripts for play and I  can't be bothered to think of them all myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to get creative and create scripts for a variety of eras, genres and tones: one of the things I mention in the guidelines is using a script that draws on known historical or fictional events for its content: imagine interviewing peripheral characters involved in the events of <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> or <i>Star Wars: A New Hope</i>!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333898/#Comment_333898" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-11T13:49:43+00:00" title="July 11, 2011  1:49PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James, I'm not getting the clearest of pictures.  <br>Why is "who" not good to ask in Key Points? <br>I mean, I think I get it.  <br>Asking "who" rubs up against the implied "who" that's been already set-up(the other players are the implied whos).<br>So, at what point can you point fingers at the other players?<br>How many players is this for, by the way?<br>I like having a goal, a foreseeable out.  <br>Like giving a dangerous person a way out, a clear way of escape so they don't feel trapped.<br>When you played this, did anyone feel trapped?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
