That means "role game" and/or "role play". It's the most common term used to describe, for example, improvised plays/sketches in school (it's actually part of the mandatory Teaching Plan/L\xc3\xa6replan to have "rollespill" as part of the Norwegian curriculum). <br><br>When telling people I'm making a "rollespill" about the Holocaust, I've had no adverse reactions. When I tell English speakers I'm making a "role-playing game", some get very upset at the idea of playing a game about atrocities. That's why I'm no longer calling "Kristallnacht" a role-playing game in most contexts; it gives the wrong impression to many people. It has few, if any, game-like elements, and has much more in common with theatre than with D&amp;D; however, I see it as a natural development of a branch of the role-playing medium.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88533/#Comment_88533" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-17T04:37:29+00:00" title="August 17, 2007  4:37AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2007 4:41AM by Georgios.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In German there's no distinction either.
