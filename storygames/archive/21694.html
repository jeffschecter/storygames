I have some friends that have never played an rpg before and want to try it.  I have talked to them a bit about what they are interested in and what they want to get out of it.  The gist is that their curiosity was piqued by seeing interesting character art (on social media) from other people's campaigns and they want to create an interesting fantasy character and play a game that engages with that character's personality.<br/><br/>To the best of my understanding, they are interested in:<br/>- Playing a recognizable fantasy archetype (anything in the Tolkien/ D&amp;D popular imagination)<br/>- Playing a character that feels unique<br/>- Play that focuses on character drama: personality, goals, motivations<br/>- Narratives where adventure  (overcoming dangerous environments and monsters) is tied to this character-level drama<br/>- Narratives that test interpersonal relationships and ethical commitments<br/>- Narratives with substantive opportunity for character development, or at least change<br/><br/>The systems that leap to mind as doing some of these things:<br/>- Monsterhearts: nails basically everything I'm looking for except for the setting and the 'adventure'.<br/>- Dungeon World: brings the sense of setting and adventure, but (in my limited experience) relies on freeform development of character drama.  Bonds give a launching-off point but not meaningful mechanical follow-up.<br/>- Follow: I think some of the quests could do this perfectly, but the Gm-less structure and open-ended scene framing might be off-putting.  Follow is great, but it might not match some of their expectations for an rpg.<br/>- D&amp;D 5E.  I have never run it, but it's the only game they've heard of.  I expect that character creation will require them to make a lot of decisions about the elements of play they care least about.<br/>- Masks: A New Generation: I think this hits a perfect balance between interpersonal drama (from influence and conditions) and adventure.  However, this is far from the setting/ genre the group expressed interest in.<br/>-The Shadow of Yesterday?  I've never read it but the elevator pitch sounds close to what I'm looking for<br/><br/>I'd appreciate any suggestions about these system or others.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" title="Paul_D_L"><img alt="Paul_D_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">Paul_D_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474614/#Comment_474614" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-09T22:30:26+00:00" title="June  9, 2018 10:30PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Burning Wheel - probably just the Hub and a couple Spokes (Circles come to mind) for first-time gamers.<br/><br/>Blades in the Dark.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474616/#Comment_474616" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-09T22:37:40+00:00" title="June  9, 2018 10:37PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2018 10:37PM by Paul_T.">edited June 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Shadow of Yesterday/Solar System (a booklet which reframes the rules in a generic fashion, and has some great explanatory text) is an excellent game for these purposes.<br/><br/>There may be some good PbtA games for this purpose, as well.

Burning Wheel definitely brings the character drama full-force, but it's my favorite game that I no longer play.  I find that I spent too much time for my comfort telling new players to ignore 'spokes' information (because it's all intriguing).  I'm looking for a system that is pared down to relevant info for a one or two session game.<br/><br/>Blades has some of what I'm looking for, and it's one of my favorite systems to run, but this group is looking for a more traditional fantasy setting.

Players get to choose traits, but many traits have a specific effect that is only triggered by  Duel of Wits or Fight.  This specific group of players want to make their own characters in a system that they can get a handle on in around two sessions, so other games seem like a better fit than BW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474627/#Comment_474627" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-10T06:25:28+00:00" title="June 10, 2018  6:25AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My reco is going to be Hillfolk.

I've been hosting a story games night every couple months and new players take to this type of play quickly.  However, this particular group has declined invitations to story games night.  I think they might love it, but they aren't that interested in trying it out.<br/><br/>Rather they specifically want to try an rpg that matches pop culture depictions (one person is the DM, there are elves, etc) but want a game more about characters than combat.  As far as where these expectations were formed, examples they gave were Stranger Things, Freaks and Geeks, and Community.<br/><br/>Thanks for the recommendations!

(I haven't read Hillfolk yet, it's in the Large Backlog, but it sounds like it has the right goals, and it's setting agnostic, IIRC)<br/><br/>Some other alternatives (Okay, this list became longer than I was expecting!):<br/><br/>-- You might be able to run a fantasy-styled game of Anima Prime, but it'd still have some anime-stylings going on.  The players need to grab onto the drama with both hands though.  While there are a lot of flag-type mechanics, they're not heavy.<br/><br/>-- You could try Clink, which might be really up the alley of this setup, but it has one fundamental constraint that all the characters are "drifters" -- folks who wander from place to place for some reason. Though I suppose that maps pretty reasonably to "adventurers" in a fantasy setting, but it means it's a little tougher to create characters with strong ties to a place/faction.<br/><br/>-- Dreamchaser is another option, which is somewhat heavier than Clink (though probably a little lighter than Anima Prime), but I find my memory is kinda foggy on this one so I can't give it the support it might deserve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
