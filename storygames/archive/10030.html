Even people practicing sorcery think they are 100% right, justified, and with the right explanation, the Dogs will agree with them!<br/><br/>There are no real good guys. Because of the situation, being victimized, lashing out, looking for revenge, becoming bullies after being bullied... you have good people doing bad things for good reasons. And like the bad guys, they feel justified as well, and with the right explanation, the Dogs will agree with them!<br/><br/>But they don't just want to convince the Dogs, they want everyone on their side. And even if they have a sinking feeling they are wrong, they will lie to themselves, twist the facts, conveniently reinterpret the word of the king of life to paint them in a positive light. They will preach false doctrine, spread rumors, and try to sway people to their side. <br/><br/>The town starts to split into sides. As false doctrine spreads, cults form. Yet... they know if they can sway the Dogs they can sway everyone else. Or at least use the Dogs to get rid of anyone who disagrees with them. <br/><br/>So when the Dogs arrive, everyone has an agenda pointed at the Dogs. <br/><br/>But to make the situation even more dynamic, put a time pressure on it. They don't just want to convince the Dogs, they need to do it now! And first! <br/><br/>And if one Dog seems to agree with one side, have the other side focus on the undecided Dogs. Try to split the Dogs up.<br/><br/>Once the Dogs seem like they are about to make a decision... that usually means bad news for someone... and hell, even if it doesn't, people might think it means bad news... they've heard what these crazy Dogs do... so I may think I'm right but if the Dogs come after me... maybe they are just as bad as the people I blame for my mistakes... but either way... I can't loose what I have, my life, my family, my reputation... if the Dogs aren't going to listen and come after me... well I better come after them first.<br/><br/>And it escalates. If 1 person wants to retaliate against the Dogs, they aren't stupid. They want to strengthen their side. So they will form a mob or conspire with demons or try to shoot the Dogs from behind or when they sleep. <br/><br/>Push it even further. 1 person starts shooting, that makes them the bad guys in other people's eyes, and makes them feel even more justified to the point that they may start shooting as well. Let the Dogs get caught in the cross fire. <br/><br/>Then have all the people in the middle run to the Dogs for help. Keep pointing people at the Dogs.<br/><br/>And react. Whatever the Dogs do, have someone react to it in a way that further complicates the situation.<br/><br/>It's important that time is running out, everyone thinks they are right, the situation isn't clear cut, people want to use the dogs, but are afraid of what they may do, and people become increasingly desperate and prone to overreaction the more time passes.<br/><br/>Hope that helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222828/#Comment_222828" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T14:39:26+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  2:39PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I'm getting it.

I created this town specifically to target that. I also felt that my "issues" weren't necessarily grabbing my players enough, so I took the time to come up with a really intense issue, and something that would force players to confront themselves and the themes of the game.<br/><br/>The branch is called Lebanon Ridge, and its problem tree goes like this:<br/><br/>Pride: Sister Obedience is married to Brother Philip, a man twice her age and quite infirm. In his weakness, she has decided she can have the man's role as head of the household.<br/><br/>Inustice: Sister Obedience has overruled her husband, and now has brought injustice into their home. Worse, her influence is spreading.<br/><br/>Sin: As the local women seize more power, the authority of Steward Jaspar is failing. Several sins have emerged. Firstly, the women have begun to tend to worldliness, wearing shorter skirts (and even pants!) to do their more masculine work, AND are increasingly taking a more dominant role in courtship as well. They have been buying clothes frm back east (and even alcohol!) from Henry Brackett, a travelling salesman. The second sin is that of Steward Jaspar. In order to rein the local women in, he and other men of the branch have taken to hauling them into the street and beating them; the sin of violence. The third sin is the result of the two previous: the sin of disunity.<br/><br/>Demonic attacks: The demons are encouraging everyone in their sins. Women who dominate their husbands are rewarded with wisdom, vigour, and a strong sexual appetite. Men who use violence against their women are rewarded with strength and a growing feeling of righteousness. By this point, I think it's pretty clear which buttons I'm aiming to push.<br/><br/>False doctrine: The sins of the villagers have led to two false doctrines emerging. Amongst the women, the doctrine is that "The Head of the Household Needs Not Be a Man", and amongst the men it's "Violence is Always Forgiven if It Maintains Order".<br/><br/>Corrupt Worship: The Steward has taken the step of banning women from religious services until they come around. This might be bad enough, but he's taken it one step further, and has actively started preaching against women, saying they should be treated as nothing more than property; their traditional role is wrong and over-powerful. Obedience is no better: her corrupt worship has led to her leading her own services, and praying to the Queen of Life, alongside the King!<br/><br/>False Priesthood: Obedience and Jaspar are the heads of their respective cults.<br/><br/>Sorcery: Obedience may not know it, but the demons are doing her bidding. When she gives her sermons, the winds howl and rage, and when her followers call upon the Queen of Life, they find their daily tasks made easier. Jaspar, too, is growing in strength and physical resiliency as he gives himself over more and more to his destructive rage.<br/><br/>Hate and Murder: When the Dogs arrive in town, Jaspar has dragged Obedience into the town square, and is on the verge of beating her to death in front of the assembled Faithful! Sister Marilla rushes out to the arriving Dogs to let them know!<br/><br/>Obedience wants the Dogs to: give authority to her cult of womanhood and acknowledge the possibility of a woman running a household and/or the Queen of Life.<br/><br/>Philip wants the Dogs to: help him die right in the eyes of the King.<br/><br/>Jaspar wants the Dogs to: kill Obedience and put the women back in their place.<br/><br/>Marilla wants the Dogs to: kill Jaspar so that she and the other women can go on living their sinful life. Oh, did I mention that Marilla is Jaspar's daughter?<br/><br/>The Demons want: the branch to fall in on itself. They are encouraging both sides, leading to more and more violent struggle. They want the Dogs to: sanction either one or the other of the two cults. They will support whichever appears weakest to keep the conflict going, then abandon them and join the winning side.<br/><br/>If the Dogs never came, then: Jaspar would kill Obedience, but her death would just make her a martyr. The women would buy guns from Henry Brackett, and the two sides would set to killing each other. Any survivors would flee to other branches, likely bringing their false doctrine with them!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223800/#Comment_223800" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-10T17:38:13+00:00" title="August 10, 2009  5:38PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I only had one player show up. My friend Thomas is playing Brother Dunsdan Adams, a Dog with a few towns worth of experience under his belt. Thomas is a great roleplayer, and is really easy to push into tough situations, so it was all good.<br/><br/>The first thing that happens, of course, is that Marilla runs up and tells Dunsdan that Jaspar (she doesn't mention that he's the steward or that he's her father) is killing a woman in town square! Dunsdan runs up to see Jaspar putting his huge fists into the near-unconscious woman's face, and moves to intervene. I put it to Thomas like this: "You can do something, or you can let it happen. It's up to you." He said he wanted to do something, though he wasn't sure what yet, so we agreed that the stakes were "the fight". Dice were rolled, and raises and sees began.<br/><br/>He started with talking, calling the big man on his actions, and saying that the steward was the one to properly handle major disputes. This distracts Jaspar, who rises up to his full height (he has the "Big Man" trait at 2d6) and informs Dunsdan that he is himself the steward. Dunsdan refuses to be intimidated, and steps around Jaspar, putting himself between the big man and his foe. Jaspar escalates to fightin', putting his hand on Dunsdan's shoulder. Dunsdan responds by grabbing the hand and twisting it. My dice were pretty impressive, though, and I managed to reverse that, forcing Thomas to Take the Blow, and Jaspar hits Dunsdan hard, knocking him to the ground. Dunsdan has a handful of fist-fightin' traits, though, and he gets back up and clocks Jaspar. I give, and keep a "3" for following up. Thomas had a small pile of fallout, and he scored a long-term relationship with Authority 1d4.<br/><br/>I don't wait, though, and I launch an immediate follow-up conflict! Marilla rushes up and says "you've got him down! you've got to kill him before he kills someone else!" See, previously, I might not have had her come out and so brashly declare what she wants, but I think it's that holding back that's been souring my play, so, hell with it. Dunsdan says he's not going to do that, and I ask Thomas if he's willing to roll dice on it. He sighs and picks them up; we decide that "Jaspar" is what's at stake; Marilla gets to add her relationship dice with her father (2d10, since their relationship is much too important to this town for the basic 1d6) and we figure Thomas gets his new 1d4, since an authority figure is at stake.<br/><br/>Again, they start out talkin', Marilla trying to convince Dunsdan that Jaspar is too dangerous to be allowed to live, let alone be allowed to continue as steward. Dunsdan responds by keeping his cool and quoting from the Book about women's roles and authority. He hits Marilla hard, and I'm forced to take a blow, garnering 3d4 Fallout, and causing Marilla to explain a bit about Obedience and her women-centric view of the Faith, and then change tactics: she pulls a knife and goes for Jaspar herself! So now we're fighting with weapons, and things get serious! Dunsdan manages to Reverse one of my raises and pins Marilla's arms to her sides. So she changes tactics again, back to Talkin', and asks the young Dog if he likes having her pressed so close to him... I keep pushing Thomas to strike Marilla, but he's clever with his dice, and manages to defeat her with talk alone. She withdraws, keeping a 3, and helping Obedience to her feet, and leaving the men to care for Jaspar.<br/><br/>Dunsdan takes another long-term Fallout, which he assigns as a d4 relationship with Marilla, at my goading, and he gets some experience, raising his "I can take a beating" trait from 1d6 to 1d8. For her Fallout, Marilla takes a new 1d4 relationship with our lonely Dog.<br/><br/>Dunsdan accompanies the men back to the church, where Philip explains much of the background of what's going on in town. Brackett shows up to say hello, and try to sell some medical supplies, and Thomas takes an immediate dislike to the man.

I re-read the section on setting stakes very very carefully, as well as reading about a dozen APs, and I got the impression that declaring and intent, but then phrasing the stakes in a more general way, and then finally giving narrative control of the outcome to the winner <i>after</i> the conflict, so the winner has the advantage of being able to fine-tune their narration to what has gone before would work a little better.<br/><br/>I figured it would limit the problems of weirdness in outcomes not matching conflicts very well, as in the following examples:<br/><br/>1) an interrogation where one of my NPCs was able to see every single raise and never take a blow, but then had to give due to a shortage of dice. So the NPC was able to successfully deflect every single question, and then suddenly broke down and told the PCs everything, because the stakes were "does she tell us what she knows about the Demons?"<br/><br/>2) a firefight where an NPC had to take a blow, but was able to continue to fight at full capacity -- "shrug it off" was one of his traits -- and then he suddenly died at the end, because the stakes were "do we kill this guy".<br/><br/>It also allowed me to be surprised by my players. If Thomas had decided that the game would be more interesting if Jaspar killed Obedience DESPITE Thomas winning the conflict, then that ball was in his court. I might have been drifting a bit, but I think it really helped me, personally.<br/><br/>Edit: it also helped me with the problem is stakes that are not directly in opposition, but are nonetheless mutually incompatible, like if one Dog wants to lure the possessed brother into the church, and the other just wants to kill him.

I find stakes setting to be an important part of how the game plays. In your example, if the Dogs are arguing then the stakes are "Does Dog1 convince Dog2 to let him kill the possessed dude?" or "Does Dog2 stop Dog1 from trying to kill the dude?"  If Dog1 just tries to shoot the dude, then the stakes probably are something like "Does the possessed dude eat lead?" If Dog2 tries to lure the possessed dude without convincing Dog1 not to shoot him...Well, we're probably back to does the possessed dude eat lead.<br/><br/>Vague stakes don't work for me. Especially since I don't know what I'm agreeing to if I decide to Give. If the stakes are "your sister" and you give, I get the stakes.

There are something called 'stakes' in Dogs but there are not more than one of them. There is just what is at stake. There are (at least) two intents, though, which (judging from what you actually said happened in the AP) seems to be what you meant. But there's only one question that everyone is trying to address, and it is emphatically a bad idea to talk about different parties aiming for <i>specific</i> outcomes before the actual conflict is played through. This is the indie devil <i>counterstakes</i> and it has claimed many games.<br/><br/>It sounds like very general stakes worked well, though I agree that phrasing it as a slightly more specific question might work better in future cases. In terms of those suggested by Charlie, the first one works fine (Does Jaspar kill Obedience?) but the second makes more sense rephrased as 'Is Jaspar killed' or 'Jaspar's life' -- which is pretty much exactly how it got played out, based on the AP. It wasn't about convincing the Dog in the end -- and you can see how if the stakes had been 'does Marila convince the Dog to execute Jaspar' then her escalating by trying to kill Jaspar herself would have been impossible. I'm guessing this is what Adam is talking about when he worries about overly-constrained stakes.<br/><br/>Really the key point is that everyone understands what is at stake. With only two players that process can be very straightforward -- a formalized statement of the stakes is only really crucial if the situation is ambivalent or otherwise complicated enough that the players themselves are not sure they agree on what question the conflict is going to resolve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225323/#Comment_225323" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T05:10:59+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  5:10AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't find the link right now...but I'm pretty sure I remember over on the Dogs forum Vincent actually said that stakes like "What's at stake is Jaspar's Life" is more effective than "What's at stake is does Marilla convince you to execute Jaspar"<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I could find those threads (IIRC there were more than one) but IIRC setting too specific stakes was seen as counter productive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb" title="Charlie Gilb"><img alt="Charlie Gilb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/1/23/2281732/Acadia%20show.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb">Charlie Gilb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225352/#Comment_225352" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T07:51:10+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  7:51AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One way I think of setting stakes in DitV is almost like a "Yes" or "No" question, with one side representing The "yes" intent, and one side representing the "no" intent.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes Brother Solomon kill Jaspar?<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes Sister Prudence convince Solomon to change his ways?<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes the Steward convince the town to throw Sister Prudence in jail?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am actually struggling to think of stakes that couldn't be phrased in this way.

Or something.</blockquote>\nYeah, I read this too, which is one of the reasons I went down this path (although I don't think I read it on lumpley, I think I read it in someone else's AP here on SG).<br><br>Also, as in my example above, not all conflicts are going to be binary. "The fate of the possessed person" in my example above can't possibly be expressed as a binary, since there are AT LEAST three intents at play, all of which are in contest (that said, I incorrectly conflated "stakes" with "intents", above, sorry).<br><br>And bottom line is: I've run Dogs four times using stakes as proposed by Charlie and James, and it felt like I was doing it wrong, because I found it awkward and my fun suffered. I've run it once using more general, non-binary stakes, and had my best-ever game of Dogs. That's enough to tell me that regardless of what the rules say, and regardless of the Word on High from Baker, I'm going to use my stakes in more general terms.<br><br>It probably made it easier to be vague since there were only two of us. Generally, I wanted one thing, and Thomas wanted one thing, so we agreed that whoever  won the conflict got to decide what happened. In a game with more players, however, I don't see it as being a problem to say "what's at stake is the fate of the possessed person" (rather than "what's at stake is does Brother Hiram shoot the possessed person", followed by "does Sister Juniper convince the possessed person to follow her into the church"). It allows for more flexibility in the final declaration of outcome. What if the church gets blown up as one of my raises? What if Hiram is disarmed in a Turn of the Blow? Either of those would make the specific stakes an impossibility. However if the stakes are more general ("this conflict is about" rather than "does this happen?") then Juniper can consecrate some ground on the fly for her exorcism, or Hiram can just beat the demonic bastard to death with a board.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
