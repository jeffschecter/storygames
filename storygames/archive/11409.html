You pay for tech support, add-ons and out of charity, not for the base product. <br/><br/>Social networking will move into the physical sphere. When you decide where to sit on a train, your phone will suggest like-minded people. When you visit a town, you'll receive an email with all friends you have in the area. <br/><br/>The study of English literature will be largely discredited; reading will be personal and arbitrary or analysed using scientific methods. <br/><br/>Authoritarian capitalism, with its failure to invest in human infrastructure, will collapse as a viable political system. A historian will declare 'The End of History'.<br/><br/>Vegetarianism, being more environmentally friendly, will be strongly encouraged or even - in some countries - the only legal option. <br/><br/>Nuclear weapons will be considered less important for defence, but more countries will have them. A nuclear weapon will have been used in war, but the popular backlash and horrible side-effects has made it unlikely to be used again.<br/><br/>People will have a single identity for government, Internet, banking purposes with a single pin code. <br/><br/>All computing will take place in the cloud. Every computer can become your PC.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this is too optimistic a vision of the future to be much use.

Cheap goods have shifted to manufacturing plants in Africa and South America.<br/><br/>Much like England today, the USA in 100 years time will be a fading superpower. India and China will be the world's powerhouses.<br/><br/>Australia will be much ignored as it has been for the last century, as a result it will remain financially and politically stable. Perhaps one of the only economies to avoid another global financial crisis as the tectonic shift in global power moves to India and China.<br/><br/>We will still be talking about the concept of a moon base, but no headway will be made regarding this due to political infighting between the various nations, and because the "space race" has been effectively abandoned by the nations of the Earth.<br/><br/>Private enterprise will dominate space flight, led by Virgin and quickly followed by other corporate entities. There will be at least one satellite hotel. Due to cheap manufacturing in South America and Africa, these are the locations where most space flights launch (their equatorial locations also help in this regard).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254137/#Comment_254137" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T17:50:07+00:00" title="January 31, 2010  5:50PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It really depends when peak oil hits and how hard it hits (maybe it doesn't matter if fusion energy is feasible or some other great energy source is found).

Using only 26 letters and numbers, how do we give each and every piece and collection of data its own name to make it recognizeable, findable, and discrete from every other piece of data (don't think Chinese will solve this, because non-alphabetic systems hit the same problem, possibly quicker)? Even worse, what do you do about those who would attempt to cheat the system, or just make mistakes in labelling their data? This isn't science fiction, it's happening already, but it'll get worse as time passes. That's data fog, a big, amorphous mass of data that makes it difficult to find whatever you really want.<br/><br/>And now we have people pushing the idea of spimes, data produced by every individual consumer good as it moves through the world over its lifetime. What makes me laugh is that this idea will create a collossal amount of data fog, something overlooked by Bruce Sterling who came up with the name "spime" to be a term that was rare  enough to be findable through the data pollution that already fogs up search engines.

Scandinavian Valhalla cultists exhume the corpses of great warriors, or steal the DNA from museum specimens, bringing about a self fulfilling prophecy about a great eternal war. Tragically, these experiments are taken to finally prove the end of the "nature versus nurture" debate, the cloned individuals are rarely the historical equal of their originals.<br/><br/>The catholic church decries the "science", claiming that a failure to reproduce the historical figures of the past merely reinforces the notion of unique souls. Buddhists claim that this proves nothing about souls and actually verifies their beliefs in reincarnation, they believe that the clones truly are reincarnated versions of their historic originals, but in this incarnation they have new lessons to learn and thus develop differently.  <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Computing<br/></span><br/>Moore's Law still proves unstoppable, despite computing "experts" continually saying that "it will end any day now".<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Combining Medicine and Computing<br/></span><br/>Nanotechnology becomes a reality, in the form of bio-organic quantum computing cells that network as an effective hive mind. A single pill literally sets loose a swarm of robotic bacteria which reconstruct cells from a tiny level. A single pill can be used to cure all ills...for a price.<br/><br/>On the down side, computer viruses become more akin to biological viruses. Hackers can literally program viruses that damage people, or manipulate their DNA to catastrophic ends.<br/><br/>Certain companies offer immortality in the form of uploading a persons entire memory into a data storage cell. The descendants of these individuals relate to the memory patterns through a digital avatar in the form of the original person. While these digital avatars seem incredibly lifelike and have all the memories of their originals, they lack certain mannerisms and other traits. Once again, religious groups weigh in on the debate, claiming that this is due to the soul passing on, and the remaining memories merely being a reflection of the truth. As the technology improves, this becomes harder to argue.<br/><br/>The aforementioned nanotechnology swarms eventually become capable of housing the memory matrix of an individual, and thus is heralded the dawning of a truly immortal age.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

And I never said anything about realism, just credibility. \n<blockquote>Here's how to do it. Do some research and find some cool technology that you want to have your game focus on.

Finding a cool technology or scenario is my purpose for creating this thread. I've been reading as much as I can on advances in technology, but they are not as easy to find as I was hoping. Searching "future technology" doesn't yield much helpful information. Most influential technologies have specialized terminology associated with them and until I become aware of those terms I can't seem to find them. \n<blockquote>And if you put a timeline in your game I will bite your head off.</blockquote>\nAgreed, I think timelines in games are worthless.
