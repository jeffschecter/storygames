I've never played Polaris myself, though I've read it a few times and I listed to Paul Tevis's AP recordings, so I feel like I have a fairly good idea about how the game works.  Still, my gaming roots are mostly in "traditional" (or whatever the hell we're calling them this week) games with relatively little story game experience.<br/><br/>So.  I was wondering if anyone out there has ever done Polaris with non-gamers and could offer some advice for how to teach it and get it going as smoothly as possible.  Of course, I'm also looking for any more general advice about making Polaris awesome as well.<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102524/#Comment_102524" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T14:59:37+00:00" title="October 11, 2007  2:59PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            maybe make sure everyone understands they should make definitive statements<br/><br/>and also not be afraid to be really antagonistic when they're playing Mistaken (tell them conflict is good)<br/><br/>having the flowchart close at hand is also nice, to know what your options are                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102573/#Comment_102573" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T19:15:12+00:00" title="October 11, 2007  7:15PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thanks!  btw, i was having trouble with either story games or my connection earlier and accidentally posted this twice.  can i delete the other discussion or does Andy have to do so?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102588/#Comment_102588" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T22:09:28+00:00" title="October 11, 2007 10:09PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, I am yet to find a single use for distinguishing between "gamers" and "non-gamers".

Specifically:<br/><br/>1. The Heart MUST drive his character's story forward, ruthlessly if necessary. Don't worry about "breaking" a plot; don't think of the Mistaken as a GM. Push hard against the Mistaken, and she can push hard back against you. Just as the mistaken isn't a GM, neither is the heart a "traditional player" with a traditional "player character." Drive story forward, using any and all means available to you.<br/><br/>For example, I had a kinda crappy scene with me as the heart. I was a general meeting with a corrupt, demonic senator, who was meeting with me in my office to give me a quest to get a mcguffin from a tomb. We roleplayed in circles around each other for a bit, then ended the scene with me accepting the quest. I had this instinct that I should of had my character pull out a magical video of the Senator having an illicit affair with a minor, and then tell him to take his stupid quest and stuff it - I was going to use my men to fight the demons directly. That would of been an awesome scene I think. Instead I hesistated because I didn't want to "break" the mistaken's "plot."<br/><br/>2. The mistaken does not control every character in the game. The moons should be portraying neutral and friendly characters. One player had a nasty habit of narrating for moon characters as the mistaken. The mistaken is not a GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102692/#Comment_102692" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T09:36:51+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  9:36AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>For what it's worth, I am yet to find a single use for distinguishing between "gamers" and "non-gamers".

The reason is because the non-gamers already view it as something unusual.  Not necessarily "cultish" but different than what they've done before.  I've never presented it as being "cultish" (I'm not even sure what you mean by that, frankly) but when I mention it to people they generally don't know what I'm talking about and are confused.  When I try to give general descriptions about the activity, people often express concern that they "won't be good at it." or that they will look "foolish".  In the current situation I'm talking about I did my best to push the fact that it's not a difficult thing to do, and that everyone will be playing this particular game for the first time.<br/><br/>Anyway... I agree that the distinction between gamers and non-gamers is not always useful.  In fact, when we do get together for Polaris I'm going to have to fight the urge to explain the game by comparing it to other games, because that will only confuse these friends of mine more.  Still, I think it is a useful distinction in some ways.  If I say to a gamer friend, "Want to get together and play this new roleplaying game?" they at least know what I mean by "roleplaying game."  Someone who isn't a gamer may very well not even have that level of understanding at first.<br/><br/>But we're kind of getting off topic.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  If you don't want to think about gamers and non-gamers, that's fine Simon.  do you have any advice for getting a game of Polaris off to a good start with a group that has never played that particular game?<br/><br/>And JC, I've considered lending one or two of them the book, but I don't know that they'd have much time to check it out.  We're all college students and fairly busy.  Still, it would be nifty if they at least had a chance to look over the setting chapter.
