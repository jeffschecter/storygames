I have some that are solidly board games. I'm working on one that is solidly a card game. I've done miniatures and RPG focused ones in the past. I envision about twelve more years of creative work in my life (I'm thinking I'll be done with it when I'm 60) so I don't have to make a bizzillion more games. I can see where the commercial games will go which leaves me with what comes after that.<br/><br/>In my gaming "retirement" I want to just play. But what type of game?<br/><br/>It doesn't have to be commercial. It can be built off of things I don't make and don't sell. It can grow out of my original hobby - toy soldiers.<br/><br/>I want a miniatures game that can handle stories and non military action as well as battle. I know I'll use some variation of Matrix Game. I've got to get back to work right now buy I'll be back later with my initial thoughts.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351446/#Comment_351446" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T07:58:52+00:00" title="December 14, 2011  7:58AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been wanting someone to make that so I could play it with my kids.

The first step is laying out the terrain. I'll provide all of that. It doesn't matter what it is per se so legos, plush animals etc. would all work. <br/><br/>All the toy people that can appear in the game will be laid out next to the terrain board. Players will be assigned troops to move (I have lots of civilians so not all the troops have guns.)<br/><br/>The figures are set on the board - with the hero figures either entering it or being at a start location (the tavern for instance). The heroes will have some kind of mission. <br/><br/>Though the players move different figures, they are all running the heroes. What is different between players is that they decide whither they want to make good things happen, bad things happen, or realistic things happen. <br/><br/>I think I will have player roll movement distances and move their figures. This will give people lots to do. Each turn everyone gets to move.<br/><br/>At any point in the game player may make a scene happen. I'll probably make it a formal step but what is happening is that someone jumps up and takes the initiative to do something. They say what happens. I think this is what happened when HG Wells was playing with his kids. After a person makes something up, the other players get to challenge it. They may alter it or try to replace it. The issue is settled by a dice roll (either the two players rolling off - high roll wins - or the challenger rolls 7 or 8 or better on 2d6). If a player makes up something that everyone else hates, the challenges should zap it or make it acceptable. Once the challenges are done each of the other players gets to start a turn where they build on the story. They are also open to challenges. <br/><br/>That is it for the rules. There are no combat rules, no social rules, no rewards system. It is just people moving in and making stuff up. Social things can happen even in the middle of combat so it could be like a movie that does a close up of one person. It is like "let's pretend" just with a few rules that allow players to disagree with one another and how to settle those disagreements. <br/><br/>What do you think?<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351465/#Comment_351465" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T11:47:44+00:00" title="December 14, 2011 11:47AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2011 11:48AM by Nathan_H.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd go about some things differently.

He has a neat visual aid for it, a sort of arc that has spaces on it, and he leaves it up to the playersto decide what scale of stuff is being resolved in a go. They can move the scale way down to slo-mo bullet time and have move by move, shot by shot action, or move it way up to the other end of the scale and use it to describe bigger or longer term events.<br/><br/>One of the things I think minis users could benefit from is really thnking about how flexibility of that sort is commonly used in primarily verbal gaming. It really is very similar to how kids play with toys. they sort've natually knwo how to scene cut, or jump ahead in time to the next interesting bit, then slow down and go indepth, and switch between different scales of ction to get to the interesting meaty bits.<br/><br/>A couple of thins I do find notable about Wells' <i>Floor Games</i>.<br/><br/>First, Wells and his kids played really fast and loose with scale. Like really fast and loose. I find this pretty interesting, as noted above. In general, when folks play with minis and terrain, they play a bit more like wargamers, where those issues of scale are important. Kids tend to play more with dramatic scale, or with what some wargamers call "toy scaling", where different objects, and different areas, can and do have different scales, based on both dramatic simplification and on practical, real space constraints.<br/><br/>PDFs and hardcopies of the book, for example, show the Islands game they played and which is described in detail, as having all sorts of different scales involved, rather than any sort of consistent scale.<br/><br/>I would also note that Wells also gives us some indications that system, at least in the Lumpley principle sense, is present inthe games he was playing with the boys. In some chapter, he talks about the fact that when setting up their town, he has the two boys each begin building their own section, and beginning to put some fiction into it before they begin playing together. this is rather different from standard rpg approach in that one person (the GM) is not starting that of alonef, and is also fairly different from a common story game approach where the area/characters/situation tend to be created collectively.<br/><br/>As to not tying this sort of game to action-adventure, it's also pretty clear that while action is often employed in those games ( and I would certainly want it in any I played) that much of their games actually involved non-combat fiction and drama. Not sure where I'm going with that bit, beyond noting that it is certainly possible to have dramatic goings on with miniature toys at the base of the activity, and not have it immediately devolve into a battle for life and death between armies.<br/><br/>I'd also note that similarly, in the Braunstein game that Dave Wesely famously put together, we don't have many accounts of combat either, despite the game being set against the backdrop of a coming battle. Action and intrigue, certainly. Sabre rattling and a fair bit of implied potential violence yes. But only one example ever generally brought up ( a one on one sword duel) ever regularly mentioned in accounts of that similar sort of game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351535/#Comment_351535" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T22:03:42+00:00" title="December 14, 2011 10:03PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple follow up stray thoughts:<br/><br/>Chris E:<br/>What if, instead of players playing the heroes, one each, they were able to say, at some point, "Hey y'all, this character is special to me!"<br/><br/>Now special in this context doesn't necessarily mean the character is all geared up and powerful and talented ( although, honestly, it certainly might), but rather was an indication that they wanted the character regularly involved, and had some sort of, if not ownership, some say in how the character partcipates in the story. if not a final say, more of a deciding vote.<br/><br/>It's a bit different from playing a hero. The character might be comedic, or villainous, or heroic. And the player isn't necessarily tied to that character.They're just getting out there to the other players that they think the character is terribly important to play in some fashion, and they are invested enough that they want some say in what goes on with the character. Maybe players can have more than one of these types of character ties?<br/><br/>As for one or two simple mechanics, these days I actually favor multiple tools being available. Why not offer all sorts of tools (mechanics) and put them into the hands of all players? None of them need be particularly complex, but I would tend to emphasize them more in the fashion that i use tools as an old school GM; The right one for the job, and not used overly consistently. I kinda think players can be trusted with that, actually.<br/><br/>Finally, I'd ask you, is this about play ( as opposed to "game")? I That's where my interest is in this subject. Lots of smarter monkes than me write games, so I buy their stuff and use it. for me, i'm more interested in imaginative play, and that seems like where you're going with this thread. Am I on the right track here?<br/><br/>If this is about Play rather than Game, how do those things differ, and what sorts of things can be borrowed from all the work already done on Games to enhance play?<br/><br/>Funny thing is, I learned more( and was reminded moreof useful techniques) in that thread on Maps being good or bad about cool stuff to do in maps+minis using play by the folks that were arguing against their use, than by the folks arguing for their use...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_351539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351539/#Comment_351539" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T22:43:43+00:00" title="December 14, 2011 10:43PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>After a person makes something up, the other players get to challenge it.</blockquote>You're saying, like, the other players get to judge your contribution in the game?

I see there being some juicy characters in each mix that the players will want the "hero" character to interact with. They will move their characters up to creat scenes so they can chew the juicy characters up (not kill them - the Fem Fatal needs to seduce the hero. What's Indiana Jones without the girl?) So the players do have other characters that they can champion and not all the scenes have to be about the hero. They can be anywhere on the board where something interesting is happening. <br/><br/>I envision people making up stories which for the most part go unchallenged or added to. When people do make changes it will be from the perspective of making good things happen, bad things happen, or realistic things happen so the players are more cooperating than conflicting. It could happen though that a player comes up with a world wrecking or stupid action that kills the game. I want to empower the other players to shut them down within the rules (rather than relying on the unspoken social rules of everyone looking at the player and staring). For the most part though I imagine a turn consisting of one player saying something, then the next player adding to it in their turn, and so on around the table. It would be possible to play without ever rolling a challenge roll. <br/><br/>There would be lots of movement rolls though!<br/><br/>One of the fun things about toy soldiers is moving them around. A dice roll creates breaks between turns so it feels more game like. It will also spread figures out unless the player works to keep people together. It saves people from thinking about who is in a scene.<br/><br/>Having rolled encounters would also be useful to goad people into action. <br/><br/>Bob's idea about the GM creating adversity is interesting. I won't have an official GM but since it is a game that I'll run, I will be the host who brings the game. I could see there being a hero and a villan with a build in conflict so the players are running both sides at once. I just don't want people playing a straight wargame.<br/><br/>I'm less interested in scale than in the toys leading to fun scenes.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351565/#Comment_351565" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-15T07:35:38+00:00" title="December 15, 2011  7:35AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2011 7:45AM by komradebob.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the host concept, but for strictly selfish reasons, I'd ike to explore options for seperating it from a semi-GM role.<br/> <br/>Meaning, hey, I bought/painted/built the toys and organized this minis game party, now I want to play too!<br/><br/>As for getting something more than just a wargame, I am firmly of the belief that it has something to do with Breyer Horses and recruiting players who played with them incessantly as children. <br/><br/>This undoubtedly will be a primarily female demograohic that you'll nbe looking to recruit ( Eeek! ;D)<br/><br/>Edit:<br/>Alternatively, I suppose you could require invitees to the event to have read <i>Floor Games</i> prior to play so they have at least an inkling of where you're going with the style of play in a broad sense.<br/><br/>Come to think about it, is <i>Floor Games </i>out of copyright protection?

I'm thinking ahead to when my memory starts going but I still want to play. The reason I'm liking the "Make up a story - challenge" mechanic is that it allows for anything to happen, is very simple, and covers everything I might want to have happen in a game. Add in dice modifiers for wounds or problems and it covers wverything.<br/><br/>I think I'm over wanting to simulate anything. I don't care if figures are out of scale if they look right.

It nicely describes the hows and whys of toy scaling.<br/><br/><i>Ship Size and Scale<br/>Real ships and boats are much larger than most people think. The ironclad model above is roughly patterned on the 1873 turretship HMS Devastation; it would be nearly four feet long, if modeled in accurate scale for 25mm figures. Clearly we can't even approach literal realism within the confines of a 4x8 foot gaming table. The model is simply a symbolic placeholder for the ship, in a game with a tremendously compressed ground scale.<br/><br/>Since we cannot make it realistic, we have to settle for making it visually appealing and useful as a game element. We can do the first by exaggerating the vertical dimension and turning the model (toy, actually) into a cartoon representation of a generalized 19th century warship, and the second by keeping it as small as possible without seeming totally ridiculous. In fact, the model is only 9" long and 2.75" wide; each turret can barely contain three figures, let alone two naval guns and their crews. Yet it can happily steam back and forth on a 6" strip of blue paper along the edge of the gaming table, provide artillery support, land marines, look roughly proportional to the scale of the battle, and add to the Victorian visual effect. If it were much larger, say even 12 or 14 inches long, it would require nearly a quarter of the table for water, severely lack maneuverability, and visually dwarf the land action (which is, after all, the main subject of the game).<br/><br/>Moral: be ruthless with your ship sizes. The ironclad is 9", the dhows are a bit large at 8+", the gunboat is 7.5" and the launches are 6." We know a steam launch is not 2/3 the size of an ironclad, but we live with the discrepancy in order to get a reasonable number of figures in the launch, and also keep the ironclad playable. </i><br/><br/>In terms of concept, those guys were only talking in one direction of toy scaling. You can go both ways, for example, scaling up important locations, and having areas that would effectively be much larger occupy about the same amount of footprint on the table top.<br/><br/>Minis wargamers already do this regularly, even if it isn't much talked about. (There was a recent thread on theminiaturespage.com called something like "Is Scale Dead?" that was debating pretty much exactly this point, however, and got very, err, heated at points.)<br/><br/>For examples of upscaled and downscaled, go over to The Virtual Armchair General website (thevirtualarmchairgeneral.com) and check out both the products page for Mean Sets and the one for Mean Streets. Those models are of personal interest to me, because I like InterWars Era/Pulp minis gaming. The upscaled Mean sets models are interiors of classic period locals, often with no exterior walls.<br/><br/>Approaching minis gaming from the perspective more of a storygames approach, both could really be on the tabletop at once.  A consistent scale isn't truly necessary.<br/><br/>Rather, if scale is involved at all, for anything, we might want to think in terms of some sort of practical response to the items on the tabletop. Or maybe we don't even need to do that? Crossfire is a popular minis WW2 game that uses no set movement rate nor weapons range, and simply lets the tabletop set up dictate those things.<br/><br/>We might not even need to go that far, simply allowing movement and action follow the course of the drama/fiction as it develops, then taking a page from our non-minis using friends in the<b> Maps?</b> thread recently, and simply using some sort of simple roll off between playing when there is a mismatch/alternate events in the fiction ( a better word than conflict for this perhaps?).<br/><br/>As to rules complexity, I don't personally desire much in terms of mechanics.<br/><br/>OTOH, I do think there could be quite a lot to say about different ways to approach the initial set up parts of this type of game to give very different experiences.<br/><br/>For example, Chris, you seem to be thinking in terms of adventure fiction, a bit like a more traditional GM+Players+mission set up.<br/><br/>These days, I'm thinking more in terms of multiple characters, multiple players, and a, I dunno," town playset" set up. In my case, there's no real mission, just personalities and maybe an overshadowing event.<br/><br/>Both of these could use a different pre-game set up technique, as well, possibly, as during-game techniques. Not mechanics, but tools.<br/><br/>Even those are just two basic possibilities, and that's before we break other stuff out.<br/><br/>__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>My personal conclusion about this stuff is there are a good handful of pretty creative folks all working independantly on similar and related gaming that has minis+terrain layout at its core, and also an urge to make it different from wargaming ( although generally still involving exciting action and exotic people and locales).<br/><br/>I'm coming to believe there isn't one answer, and that's why we aren't seeing one standout game.<br/><br/>Rather, it might be better to gather a bunch of techniques and philosphies together about related issues in this sort of gaming, and just build some sort of recipe book for it, to be shared around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351655/#Comment_351655" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-16T08:13:17+00:00" title="December 16, 2011  8:13AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A big chunk of the issues of scale are solved by the miniatures I use. 15mm figs (1 or 2 figures per 1x1 inch stand) give a big picture look. I could do it as a company level game where each stand is a platoon or part of a platoon. Or a stand is a company (6 to a battalion) so a player running 20 stands is a Brigadeer, for straight out war games. 25mm figures are individuals in my mental world so they are about person to person interactions. <br/><br/>For the moment I can't do much testing out in public of the rules, my convention time really needs to focus on the games I have for sale.

I thought they were 25/28mm minis, so, individuals, right?<br/><br/>Thinking about that collection, can you tell me about a game that you can envision running with some of that collection?<br/><br/>Maybe something a little weird, like an unlikey combinationof stuff.<br/><br/>I'm not looking for full system details or even deep scenario stuff. Just hit me with a broad concept for a set up and the general gist of the thing and what you'd want to include toys-wise. It doesn't need to be stuff you already have even. It could be some stuff you have, plus things you'd like to have to finish it off.<br/><br/>I'll play fair. Here's one that I'd like to create and run and play in:<br/><br/>Title: The Race for the Goblin-Throne Y2K, A History:<br/><br/>A send up on the US Presidential Election of 2000. The game takes place in Goblin Town, a sort've eternal Halloween place, a bit like something out of Nightmare Before Christmas. <br/>Two Parties, The GOOP ( The Great Old Ones Party) and The Demonkratz ( Hollywood Monsters) are vying to see who will end up as the Goblin King and thecontrolling party in the  Congress of Nightmares for the next year (from Halloween to Halloween). The GOOP, led by Nyarlathotep, have failed to deliver the promised Y2K Apocalypse, and the Demonkratz are looking to gear up and win big in the next election cycle. The GOOP is in shambles but still powerful, though divided in loyalty between Nyarlathotep and Dread Cthulhu. The Demonkratz have several contenders for the Goblin Throne, but no single strong candidate. A few charismatic independants are threatening to throw the balance of the election as well, and have the clout to seriously unbalance the election in one direction or the other.<br/><br/>The board looks like and minis collection: <br/>A combo of shabby Halloween haunted houses, cemeteries, and spooky woods.A few swamps and caves too. Maybe a shipwreck and/or set of egyptian ruins. Think Tim Burton-esque on a budget.<br/> <br/>The toys are mostly cthuloid monsters plus a load of Hollywood iconic monsters, a bunch of cheap zombies, some random cats, witches, ghosts, and a couple packs of jack-o-lanterns and familiars by Reaper Miniatures. There're some modern day civilian types, and maybe a couple cars or two as well.<br/><br/>The general flow of action:<br/>Lots of negotiation and back stabbing. Some actual action/chase/combat sequences that don't permenatly knock any characters out after a while out because monsters rematerialize. Civil Disobedience and general cheaty political stunts. Mindless, single issue voters to be wooed (Zombie Power!). Humans intruding on Election Day, either as pawns or independant actors who don't realize the monsters are real, coming into Goblin Town more frequently as the wall between worlds becomes thin and permeable closer to the election.. The crowning of the new Goblin King at 13 O'clock, Halloween Night. What comes in the wake of political victory? What promises are kept? What are the side effects? Who is out of power and plots revenge and how?<br/><br/>How many people?<br/>Well, at least 2-3, when a scene based approach seems best. Good at 4-6, with more flexibilty. Gets very Larpish at 7+. Max out at 15-20, and probably needs some confederates(in the magic show sense)/co-GMs/co-hosts.<br/><br/>Play time:<br/>3-5 hours with breaks. Possibly up to 6 hours.<br/><br/>Why this?<br/>I want to trot out Halloween/Hollywood monster stuff from my collection that doesn't have a good skirmish wargame use. I love goofy Halloween themed TV shows that use cliched monster stuff with a twist. Spoofing very serious political stuff is fun and a bit naughty and irresponsible. It also gives me an excuse for some lonely fun building the goodies I don't already have or collecting them.<br/><br/>___________________________<br/><br/>Anyway, that's mine.  I have most of the goodies to put that together.

The Median age is 48 so I don't expect kids stuff but they are romantics so wild Harlequin stuff may come up.<br/><br/>I'll create a male hero and female heroine and put them in a bustling town with conflicting parties (various noble houses, the church, various peasants). Everyone will pick an outlook to champion (good bad realistic) and there will be a mission for the two hero types to accomplish. I think I'll give the various factions some mission as well but they will not have a specific player champion (save the person who moves them). I think players will focus on the main leads actions and the rest of the world will not do much. <br/><br/>Beyond that I've got no plans.<br/><br/>I want to see what happens. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351998/#Comment_351998" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-19T23:34:52+00:00" title="December 19, 2011 11:34PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you going to try some sorta scene based approach?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352010/#Comment_352010" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-20T06:09:23+00:00" title="December 20, 2011  6:09AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to assign factions for movement purposes and have people move a finger length a turn and then leave it up to the players to jump in a nd make up the scenes.

I wrote up a wole long post this morning, but my internet connection eated it!<br/><br/>First off, best of luck with this Chris. It sounds like awesome fun and I wish I was there to try it out myself.  It sounds like absolutely great fun in the offing.<br/><br/>I think sometimes that as long term gamers, we worry a bit much about the ability of other adults, especially those who aren't gamers also, to engage in play pretend.<br/><br/>I also think that sometimes, we try to create rules to make things more game-like for this style of play, in the hopes that concept of "game" will make the play an easier entry point for them to engage with. the activity.<br/><br/>I'm beginning to suspect this urge, though well meant, might be a bit bass-ackwards.<br/><br/>Perhaps this would be more easily explained as, well, imaginative play first and foremost, with some direction upon how to approach that.<br/><br/>Rules don't really apply. These game aren't truly competitive, at least not in the standard sense we find in board and card games, or even miniatures war games. Rather, when we dip into the mechanics of more competitive games and their structures, we're taking those rules, and using them as tools, to enhance fun and add some interesting randomness into play.<br/><br/>That's kind of a big difference right there.<br/><br/>My earlier attempt at posting was mostly aimed at advice for players in these kinds of games, in a broad sense. It hit return and post this now, and try to recreate the advice in  the next post. How much of it you'll find useful for your Christmas Eve game, and how much other folks participating in this thread will find useful is anyone's guess, but hopefully it will better give an idea of wher I'm coming from these days in my thinking.<br/><br/>If it doesn't get eated, too...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352091/#Comment_352091" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-20T21:46:15+00:00" title="December 20, 2011  9:46PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Congratulations!<br/><br/>You've been invited to a very special kind of party. It's a play pretend party, and your host has pulled out all the stops. They've set up a great big table filled with little places and little people, and they've asked you to come over and spend the evening making up a story with those things. <br/><br/>Chances are good it's been a really long time since you did something like that, and chances are also good that your host has described the events as a game to be played.<br/><br/>That's, well, a tiny bit off-mark.<br/><br/>Really, it's a lot like the kind of toy play most of us did as kids, whether it was with stuffed animals, or action figures, or toy soldiers or farm animal toys. <br/><br/>Sometimes, it's a little like a game. We may take turns, or roll dice, or draw cards while we play, but those things aren't really meant to determine a single winner of the event. they're meant to help add a bit of randomness and uncertainty to the events as the story is being built and to spark our imaginations.<br/><br/>The kind of play you're going to engage in is as much like a movie as a game ( or maybe a novel or comic book or radio play). It's a funny sort of movie though. You'll be acting as actors, and directors and audience all at the same time, and nobody really knows where the story is going to go There's no script to follow, although the host will tell you about the starting general situation, things surrounding that situation, and probably give you some hints and ideas that you can bring into play as the event goes on.<br/><br/><b>What're you going to see when you get there?</b><br/>Usually you'll see a big table laid out representing a place of some kind, and a whole bunch of little toy people ( and animals and robots and monsters, depending on the theme for the event that the host has come up with).<br/><br/>That's the fictional place the host has set up where the story you're going to make will take place.<br/><br/>Chances are, not all of it is properly to scale. An important place like a main character's house may be very big, while a dark forest that is supposed to be vast is represented by some trees and rock, with about the same footprint as that important house.<br/><br/>This is kinda like a movie too, in the way that sets are used. We really only show the really important bits onscreen, and let the audience's imagination fill in the rest. Likewise, the collection of people toys doesn't equal, one for one, the entire population. Just important, special characters are represented, along with a smallish collection of other folks they might eventually interact with.<br/><br/><b>What the host is going to tell you</b><br/>After you've had some time to look over the cool stuff the host has laid out ( and really, all people hosting these kinds of things do love to hear folks oohing and aahing over the cool thing they've put together), the host is going to gather you and the other players together, and let you in on the Big Idea of the event.<br/><br/>The Big Idea is just the main concept of the setting and situation and of some of the characters involved, and of other fictional events surrounding the situation.<br/><br/>It's a little like watching a movie trailer at the theatre. It gives you the basic concept and introduces some characters, but hopefully you don't end up knowing all of the cool parts of the movie from just the trailer.<br/><br/>This is going to be a pretty short affair, just a few minutes long.<br/><br/>By the end of it, you should have some pretty good ideas about characters that you think would be fun to play with, some ideas on how to portray some of those characters, and the kinds of events the host is interested into working into the event. You'll also likely have your own creative juices start flowing at this point, and be chomping at the bit to start playing pretend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352092/#Comment_352092" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-20T21:47:46+00:00" title="December 20, 2011  9:47PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [continued]<br/><br/><b>What happens next? Players start getting a special character or two to play with!</b><br/>Depending on what the host has set up ( and every single one of these events is a little different), there may already be a group of characters with names and motivations based on the toys, and the host will help you use some method to pick one or two that you'll have special consideration with regards to. Basically, you'll be asked to portray them during the game.<br/><br/>Some hosts will have a lot of details with characters already made. Other hosts will hand out the characters randomly, or ask you to 'audition" to play that character. Other hosts will leave most of the character creation up to the players, giving you just some ideas about the situation and types of people in it, and will work with all of the players to build those characters before play begins.<br/><br/>Again this part is pretty fast. By the time everyone is done creating and picking characters, you should know some basics about not only your special character, but also about the other special characters that will be in the story, and maybe a bit about some minor characters as well.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that you'll be able to do other stuff besides just portray that one character. Even if that character comes to a bad end or leaves the story, you'll still be asked and encouraged to participate in the event throughout the entire session. You may also be asked to occasionally play other characters as well, and be able to offer ideas about things outside of that character.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that your special character or characters could be anyone in a movie or story. They might be heroes or villains or rogues or fools or comedic characters or even just ordinary people with ordinary concerns. What's important is how you portray them. <i>Remember, even though we call these "games", you, as a real person and player won't lose the game even if something bad happens to your special character.</i><br/><br/><b>The story starts</b><br/>Once that's all taken care of, the host gets everyone together, and does a quick run down of where the special characters are and what they're up to. Often, you'll have some say in this, so go ahead and openly offer ideas.<br/><br/>Usually, the host will offer some kind of event to get things going. Another common option will be for the host to ask which player has an idea of where to start, and then takes suggestions, only then deciding on where to begin the story. This is kinda like the opening scene of a movie, or at least the first big important scene.<br/><br/><b>If you've got a special character involved in the events, go portray them!</b><br/>Move your toy character around<br/>Speak in the voice and mannerisms you imagine that character having<br/>Talk with other players special characters who are there<br/>If there's cool action stuff happening, move character models around to show that action. Go into movie style slow motion if you want<br/>Feel free to talk out of character and let the other players in on secret stuff that you've come up with, whether it's internal thoughts and motivations for your special character or stuff that the audience would see in a movie,  but that some or all of the characters would be unaware of<br/>Feel free to play minor bit characters or move stuff around that isn't your special character<br/>Invite other players to portray your special character or other minor characters you create on the fly using models in the collection<br/>Offer suggestions on the portrayal of other characters<br/><br/><b>If you don't have a special character in the action</b><br/>...So what? Go on and play too!<br/><br/>You have a right to do all of that stuff as well. Mostly though, be supportive of the events that are going on by suggestions, playing bit characters, and also be willing to suggest it's time to cut the action going on and refocus the next bit of the story on later events, events happening elsewhere, and most especially on special characters that haven't gotten any "screen time" yet.<br/><br/><b>Playing out the rest of the story</b><br/>The play of the rest of the story follows a similar pattern. People play a bit of action as the characters, and then someone suggests that tis bit of story is over and play proceeds to the next cool event, like a scene cut in a film.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352093/#Comment_352093" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-20T21:48:31+00:00" title="December 20, 2011  9:48PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [continued]<br/><b>When does this all end? And how?</b><br/><br/>The game ends when either a practical time limit has been reached ( usually the host will set aside a certain time to stop, like midnight, or a certain amount of play time, like four hours), or players can close things up when the majority of players agree that the story has mostly run its course and that the story lines that have been developed have been largely resolved.<br/><br/>It's okay to leave some loose ends. Without loose ends, how could movies have good sequels? And also, how could hosts be convinced to put together a follow up events???<br/><br/>It's generally considered good form for a host to keep track of real world time, and let players know when play time is coming to a close, maybe with a warning at a mark about  half hour before they want to close up game play. It gives all the players a chance to work towards tying up some of the bigger loose ends in the story that has been created.<br/><br/><b>What the heck is the host doing during all of this?</b><br/>Often, the host remains content to play minor characters and offer events into the developing story. the other big job is for the host to introduce those tools, stolen from game mechanics, to the other players. Early on, the host is probably  bit like a combination of teacher and referee, while showing off the tools available. Once players have seen those mechanics available and their us, the host can hand off the responsibility for calling for the use of those mechanics to the other guests and trust they'll use them wisely and to everyone's benefit.<br/><br/>It isn't necessary for you to know all of the tools available right off the mark. You can always ask for advice from the host.  After a bit of play in a single event, or after being invited back to play for repeated sessions, chances are good that the host will be more than happy to let players use those tools on their own, and will begin playing more with special characters themselves.<br/><br/><b>You can call for breaks!</b><br/><br/>If you're old enough, you may remember when movies had intermissions. It's okay to call for breaks, get some drinks and snacks, w the call of nature, and freely discuss your ideas that you think would be cool to bring into the next active part of play. Really, please keep this bit in mind and do it.<br/><br/><b>We ended the game, now what happens??? Everybody is a WINNER!!!</b><br/>Know what? I'm a big darn dirty hippy. I would be like that teacher you had in grade school who figured out a reason to give everybody a Gold Star for something or other, and end of the year congratulatory certificate. I'm also old enough to be okay with that.<br/><br/>During play, some special character that was being portrayed came out the winner. probably everybody knows who that was, but just do a simple voice vote to determine it. Congratulate the winner as a group. Give a round of applause.<br/><br/>It's now that player's job to decide on the next award. they give it to another player. They can consullt with the group or call for a vote.<br/><br/>What kind of award? Here are some ideas:<br/><br/><i>Best Villain portrayal<br/>Best Comedic character or Rogue portrayal<br/>Best overall portrayal of any character<br/>Best idea or storyline introduced that surprised everyone<br/>Best action scene direction/facilitation(bonus points for sound effects!)<br/>Funniest/stupidest/best fake accents<br/>The player who really "got it" in terms of setting/situation/feel and showed that through their suggestions and actions in game<br/><br/>Or really, anything else they can think of.</i><br/><br/>Once an award is given, the receiving player chooses the next award to give to another player. Awards can be repeated, but everyone has to get at least one.<br/><br/><b>Does the Host get awards?</b><br/>If you want, you can certainly give the host awards just like any other player, especially if they were really active with special or supporting characters.<br/><br/>Hosts love warm fuzzies as much as everyone else!<br/><br/>If your host is like me though, what they want most of all is help getting yet another and another one of these events together, and they'd really, really like to be a player in one rather than both a host and a player. Anything at all that you can do to help that happen would be vastly appreciated as a reward. it doesn't have to involve money (most hosts putting on these kinds of things already are committed to buying the toys and putting it together anyway).<br/><br/>But you can help by finding cool clean stuff for terrain and saving it from the recycling bin, or suggesting ides for sequels or wholly different events, or offering space to play an event in, or making connections between the host and other folks who'd enjoy these kinds of events, or just plain learning the kinds of tools the host has available and how to use them skillfully during play to add to everyone's fun. All that stuff, that's the real reward cycle for the Host.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352541/#Comment_352541" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-27T10:22:00+00:00" title="December 27, 2011 10:22AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran the game on Christmas Eve. Here is the low down of what happened.<br/><br/>There were four players: Ian (my brother) represented good, Gwyn also stood for good, Terri (my wife) represented realism, and I chose to represent bad. We all had a faction of character figures to move so we had a little interest in involving those characters in the action.<br/><br/>The game was set in medieval Paris. There where two warring noble families, the Church, and a "Jack of Hearts" a knave out to complicated the lives of the heroes. The city also included various peasants, goats, merchants, gypsies, and other rabble. Off board I had some other figures that could come into the game. Each major noble figure had an armored foot figure and a mounted knight figure if they players wanted to get all military. I also had a few green monster figures and a Doctor Who (the 4th Doctor) if people wanting to make things weird. The action would focus on a young nobleman and young lady who were destined to fall in love. Naturally they were connected to the rival families. <br/><br/>The game started with the hero and the lady first meeting in front of the cathedral. This was observed by the knave and the bishop. I set up the figures on the board to set up the scene. From here on we moved little men and talked our way through scenes. <br/><br/>So I started the first scene by saying something like "They see one another across the market place and are smitten! Love at first sight!"<br/><br/>I invited the other players to challenge me but none did. My statement was fact. <br/><br/>Next we went around the table. Each player got to add to the scene (also subejct to challenges). I think I challenged someone over something to show how challenges work (the two player roll 2d6 each, high roller wins). That covered all the rules. A story grew from there. <br/><br/>Briefly: The bishop pulled the lady into the cathedral. The hero and the knave followed. The lady turned out to not be very nice and the hero not too smart. The bishop had a scheme to undermine the noble families by a quick marriage that would some how reinstate the Merovengian dynasty (very DiVinci Code). The hero balked at this so the knave stepped in. Meanwhile goats spread out though the city surrounding the cathedral and turned out to be cyber goats(?) That is when Dr Who arrived though he didn't really do anything. Some magical weirdness happened as the wedding party emerged from the church and the game ended with the hero riding with the king into the square to put down the Merovengian treason. The lady and knave ended up getting burned at the stake.<br/><br/>What I noticed is that the game worked fine. The players paced themselves and came up with their own scenes without much guidance from me. In short, the game worked. It was more fun than a poorly run RPG but not as good as a high energy kick ass RPG. <br/><br/>I may be more active as a host in the future in scene framing but laizafaire worked. <br/><br/>It was not the best game in the world but it is worth developing. What I liked is how it was like floor games that my brothers and I played as kids. It also focused out attention on the figures and the board rather than on play acting between players.

They seem to match up pretty well with my own experiences trying to get similar sorts of games going.<br/><br/>A couple of thoughts:<br/>Player to Character Distancing<br/><br/>I know that lots of folks talk about how much they enjoy being the firts person mindset when they play RPGs, and how using minis distances them. I think there is indeed a certain amount of distance that will always be there. If that's the case, how can that be used as a positive rather than negative for this type of play?<br/><br/>Writing things down, or even referencing stuff.<br/>It really does seem like the written word isn't much of a friend of this sort of play when the actual game is on, doesn't it?<br/>Matthijs has a thread going about co-operative play right now, and one of the concepts being discussed is the use of some sort of poster, rather than books or sheets. Can you see any uses for that sort of thing that might aid this style of play.<br/><br/>I haven't tried it yet myself, but it seems like it might have a couple different sorts of value.<br/><br/>Why did you choose to have a "spare" collection and also have some weird stuff in it?<br/>Doing exactly that sort of thing is my first instinct as well, and i'm not at all sure it turns out all that well.<br/><br/>How exactly did your story chunks fit together?<br/>Reading your AP, it sounds kinda like you were scene by scene based, and other times it sounds like players took turns moving minis, then play developed orgaically. Could you tell me more about that?<br/><br/>Strange side question, but how did you determine if minis were close enough to interact, or did you simply not worry about it?<br/>I had a problem with something like that in one of these types of play, and had been considering some sort of procedures for temporarily bounding a space where action/ a scene was taking place, so that absolutely everything wasn't always interacting.<br/><br/>How would you choose to be a more active host?<br/>What porblems did you encounter, and how do you think that being more active could help?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Geez, I have about a million more questions too.<br/><br/>At this point, i really do think you, and me, and some other folks are really talking about a form of play, and not-quite-games. I'd really like to see some exploration of this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352617/#Comment_352617" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-28T09:01:02+00:00" title="December 28, 2011  9:01AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Never thought about using a poster for the rules. Might be useful in a convention game. For this game I wanted to keep the rules so simple that we just remembered what to do.<br/><br/>As to spares - I wanted the potential for there to be jousting. To do that there needed to be mounted figures but I didn't want men to be on horseback always. I also had knights in fancy dress and armored so I thought why not have that stage available as well. As to the weird stuff (especiall Dr Who) I wanted to channel some of the weirdness without just shutting it down. That sort of worked. I'll need to try it again in other ways to know for certain.<br/><br/>In play we did a movement phase (move all the figures you control one finger length) followed by a scene. I asked the players what scene they wanted to do next. I could have been more active and picked the scenes myself. I think I will do that the next time I play. We didn't worry about who was close enough to intereact. People were able to move characters into scenes in their descriptions. Movement bleeding into scenes. It also went the other way with people challenging movement a couple of time (scenes bleeding into movement). It really helped that we were distant from being our characters. We were all the hero, the lady, and the knave. The difference between us was whether we were trying to make bad things happen or good things happen. <br/><br/>I'm liking the idea of all of us running the same character because that means none of us is ever left out and the hero does not have a straight shot at success. We were focused on the figures interacting rather than in mini-maxing for our character. I suspect this is the opposite of the emersion Simulationist players seek. <br/><br/>I also didn't worry about the story. I started the game off with two lovers meeting for the first time and then just followed what happened next. The fact that the lover hero didn't get the girl and the girl ended up getting burned at the stake as a witch didn't matter. I just trusted that something would emerge that was a fun walk through. It did and I think it always will in a figure game because people make the little men act out psychodramas. Much like with narrativist play I didn't care where things went as long as the ride was exciting. <br/><br/>Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352620/#Comment_352620" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-28T09:24:15+00:00" title="December 28, 2011  9:24AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Floorniversalis!

It would make it a whole lot easier to talk about, since one could get right to the point, and not spend so much discussion on comparisons of what it isn't.<br/><br/>I think we should call it <b>Newell Knot Play</b>, and create some fictional eccentric Britisher as the creator and great proponent of it. Newell Knot= Neo-Wellsian Not-Wargame. In other words, miniatures play inspired by and retroactively descended from <i>Floor Games</i>, rather than <i>Little Wars</i>. Italso means considering this sort of play not an off shoot of stuff that descended from the <i>Little Wars</i>-&gt;Wargames/Miniatures Wargames-&gt;Tactics-centered RPGs-&gt;Character-centered RPGs-&gt;Story Games, but instead approach it as something to develop in parallel to that family tree.<br/><br/>Thought <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a><br/>This stuff is way closer to organized ( or at least lightly structured and lightly directed) play than a game. It's really only a game in the very broadest sense of the term. Because of that, I think we really ought to take a look at stuff like what Matthijs and other folks are talking about over in his thread about unformed ideas regarding a new approach to co-operative play.<br/><br/>Thought <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a><br/>It's almost only worthwhile to write up stuff for folks who already kinda get it.<br/><br/>I'm embarassed by this particular thought. Truly, I'm a bit ashamed of even writing that down. I mean jeez, look at my user name! You'd think I'd want to get everyone in on the fun, no?<br/><br/>Thing is, almost every discussion I've had online regarding minis play, especially stuff that goes in this mostly-play-not-really-a-game direction seems to get terribly side tracked by one of the following kinds of posts:<br/><br/>a) I don't like minis; they make me feel like a kid and roleplaying games r srs biznesss!<br/>b) Why would you ever use minis if you aren't using them for fiddly tactical positioning?!?<br/>c) Minis take me out of the 1st person mind set! That's what RPGs and Storygames are all about!!!<br/>d) Gowdamm but minis are expensive and time consuming!!! How would you even get that sort of thing off the ground???<br/><br/>Thing is, for the kinds of folks interested in these sorts of play events, none of those types of posts really apply.<br/><br/>a) Many types of imaginative gaming aren't in fact that serious to begin with, and really, I don't see where playing with toys is any more likely to have others percieve you as childlike than pretending very seriously to be an errant elf-lord, whether at a tabletop or dressed up in the woods Any of those things already marks you as a harmless eccentric.<br/><br/>b) Minis can act as inspiration for fiction when you start by looking for the latent story in them and between them. The story is only sometimes one of combat; it can be other stuff in addition.<br/><br/>c) Not all kinds of fun, successful imaginative play requires a first person minset. This is one of those kinds of play.<br/><br/>d) If you're even reading something about minis use, especially something like this, chances are good you either already have a decent collection, have access to one, are willing to consider acquiring one, or know someone who has one and you suspect might dig this sort of play.<br/><br/>Given all that, and also a vibe around these parts in particular that sometimes with a niche product/game style it really is best to simply write to an interested and informed audience, I thinkit may actually be more fruitful to follow that line of thinking.<br/><br/>In other words, let's gear posts to the person most likely to Host one of these sorts of events.<br/><br/>Thought <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a><br/>Help for the Host<br/><br/>The way I see it, these kinds of play are almost inevtibaly all unique, one-off, face to face play events.  This does kinda mean that hard and fast rules and mechanics are not only nearly impossible, but quite <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">possibly</span> probably undesirable.<br/><br/>Instead, anything written for this type of play needs to be in the form of guidance, advice, successful general approaches, and tools/methods whose expected affects on play are described so that would-be hosts can pick and choose as appropriate for their event on the very personal and local level.<br/><br/>Thought <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a><br/>It's really kind of a make-believe party at the end of the day<br/><br/>All of that stuff I talk about in thought <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> really ought to be geared to the reality that this kind of play is a one shot event. players aren't gong to have a great deal of time to learn complex mechanisc or learn complex background material. play time is likely to be short in terms we tend to think of when talking about games, and only one session long.<br/><br/>Space and time constraints, temperment of the host and players, interests outside of the imaginative situation being palyed with, a highly variable number of players from one event to the next, collection limitations, alll of that sort of thing needs to be taken into account.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353128/#Comment_353128" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-04T12:29:44+00:00" title="January  4, 2012 12:29PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So it is Homo Erectus gaming.

Because some of those methods and techniques will work just dandy with minis play that isn't intended to be deeply tactical in the fiddly maneuver sense or highly competitive like your average minis war game.<br/><br/>Wells' <i>Floor Games </i>were about recognizing the patterns that exist when you combine the inspiration from the toys, and then building a developing story and world with that, bringing in a whole big soupy mix of ideas from the players themselves.<br/><br/>What really is an update to that then?<br/><br/>To me, it means appreciating the part randomness can play, as well as appreciating newer ideas about how that can be used to inspire the pplayers. It means bringing in the concept that not everything has to be an entire crash-game built each and every time. Sometimes it's okay and even desirable to start with a core concept.<br/><br/>It also means to me that we can get back to a players-as-equals approach and away from the strong game-master or referee concept, even while recognizing places that some of that concept can be useful. Again, strictly IMO, it means that a host mostly sets things up, then teaches through example different tools, then rapidly lets the other players know that they are not only allowed to use those tools ( or make up new ones), they're positively encouraged to do so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353215/#Comment_353215" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-05T08:00:46+00:00" title="January  5, 2012  8:00AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and another quick thought Chris:<br/><br/>Even though you've been focussing on that one core die mechanic in your Actual play post, it seems pretty evident to me that you were actually using a number of different other mechanics, even if you don't recognize them as such.<br/><br/>There's good stuff in there. I think you should dissect it more.<br/><br/>I'll trow one I noticed out there for you:<br/><br/>You decided, after coming up with the core idea and related characters , to place other characterful toys around the board.<br/><br/>This too is my instinct, and seems a common one. <br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>It also seems like that caused some dilution ofthe core concept in AP. What would you do differently or the same in another game and why?<br/><br/>Those questions, your experiences with that stuff, well that's all related to a technique that can be shared. Another tool in a Host's kit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
