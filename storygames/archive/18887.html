You are the dream of everyone around you, but you're not sure what you want for yourself.<br/><br/>The Princess is about coming from the world of dreams, but not being be ready for reality.

So she can <b>make</b> them live up to it. I dunno how you'd necessarily reflect that, but...<br/><br/>If the Princess thinks you're the Beast, or the Prince, or the Hag, and you don't live up to it? She's going to warp you to fit her vision of you. Maybe you have to Hold Steady when the Princess is in the scene, if you want to contradict her image of you. She's controlling. (Maybe take a cue from some of the Queen's schtick?)<br/><br/>Oh! Based on the "No Happy Ever After" move, that could cover this ground. Have the trigger be "when someone fails your expectations", or something like that. When another character defies the archetype you assigned to them, trigger!<br/><br/>Also, I like this iteration of the Sex Move a lot better, but it feels odd to have what's effectively two moves in one. Maybe drop one half and add an XP trigger to the other one?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422668/#Comment_422668" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-09T15:43:51+00:00" title="October  9, 2013  3:43PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My biggest concern is that this skin relies on regressive gender roles. Monsterhearts is all about queering up its genre, and so The Princess needs to be all about queering up its fairy tales if it's to truly play to the spirit of the game. "The Princess" is a gendered title, which is fine if you can imagine someone saying "I'm going to play a boy Princess, I think." But then it goes on to talk about the noble prince, the helpful brother, and the wicked stepmother/matriarch. And now I don't see the possibility of boy Princesses, I see a cisnormative and heteronormative set of expectations and roles. It needs to be queered up.<br/><br/>What is the sex move supposed to be doing? I get the first half (which squicks me but is appropriate, perhaps), but I don't understand what story the second half is supposed to be telling. It sounds like the princess refusing sex provokes anger and fear, but having sex provokes remorse and self-judgment. This means that the Princess is strongly discouraged from ever approaching sexual situations, regardless of her intent or boundaries. Unless I'm misunderstanding how the move would play out: that sounds boring. Maybe alternately: having sex could represent a step away from living in a fairy tale and a step toward living in the real adult world. Mechanically, this could involve changing one of The Archetypes to reflect something grounded in the real world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422670/#Comment_422670" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-09T15:59:03+00:00" title="October  9, 2013  3:59PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What is the sex move supposed to be doing?
