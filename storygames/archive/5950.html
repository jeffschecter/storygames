If I\u2019m trying to shoot you and I succeed you have a bullet ripping through you.  However, social conflicts require a bit of special attention because Sorcerer preserves player (GM included) autonomy over his or her character (NPCs included).  No one can force another character into action even through social conflict.  The exception is when a Sorcerer orders a Demon to do something.<br/><br/>So how does social conflict work in Sorcerer?  Again the lack of stakes helps.  Let\u2019s say a man is trying to pick up a woman in a bar.  It should be noted that it is perfectly fine and dandy for the player of the man to say, \u201cI really want her to go home with me and have sex.\u201d  In fact that helps clarify the nature of the situation at hand but it isn\u2019t Stakes in the Dogs in the Vineyard or Primetime Adventures sense of the word.  If the man wins the roll that doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee the woman will go home with him and have sex with him.<br/><br/>Now let\u2019s add the fact the woman is an NPC and the GM knows that the woman has an abusive boyfriend but the player of the man doesn\u2019t know that.  It gets to the point where the man is being chatty and flirty with the woman and the woman is acting all nervous trying to get away.  We have a conflict of interest and so a Will vs. Will role is made.  Let\u2019s say the man wins.<br/><br/>At this point the GM is shifting in his seat uncomfortably (a LOT of Sorcerer rules are based on this sense of unease that other games can sometimes back you into) because as a creative participant in the game with autonomy over his character, the woman, he\u2019s thinking, \u201cThere\u2019s just no way she\u2019d go with this guy.  She\u2019s TERRIFIED of her boyfriend.\u201d  But the roll has gone in the favor of the man.<br/><br/>Here\u2019s the key point: The GM is free to narrate ANY follow up action on the part of the woman he wants.  What the dice do at this point is give the man roll over victories against that action.  Here are some viable options for the GM.<br/><br/>The GM could have the woman blurt out something about being scared of her boyfriend.  This complies with man\u2019s win because the woman is now giving up something useful to the man.  The player of the man might then choose to take the victories from his roll and roll them over to a new roll about trying to get the woman to explain why she\u2019s afraid of her boyfriend.<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>The GM could have the woman try to run away.  Notice this goes totally AGAINST the outcome of the first die roll in terms of the woman\u2019s behavior but that\u2019s perfectly fine because the player of the man can roll over his victories into a new roll, say to snag her arm and stop her from fleeing.  \u201cHey, doll, what\u2019s the rush?\u201d<br/><br/>The idea is that rolls force the situation to CHANGE and victories describe the DIRECTION OF CHANGE.  The GM can\u2019t have the woman just sit there stubbornly resisting, he has to have her do something else but it\u2019s perfectly fine to continue to follow his own agenda for the character, the player of the man just has the momentum of the situation going in his favor.<br/><br/>Here\u2019s another point: conflicts always resolve the immediate situation at hand and only for the short term (in story time).  It might very well be that the GM just says, \u201cFuck it, she goes home with you.\u201d  And then starts the very next scene the next morning with the woman incredibly hostile, maybe even violently so, screaming, \u201cYou bastard!  Why did I listen to you!   Oh my god, he\u2019s going to KILL ME!\u201d<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>Maybe he decides that the woman sees a way out in the man, goes home with him and the next morning she\u2019s all cuddled up to him and says to him, \u201cHoney, uh, there\u2019s something I didn\u2019t tell you\u2026\u201d<br/><br/>All of these are valid creative riffs off that initial die roll.  This principle applies regardless of whether it\u2019s NPC vs. NPC, PC vs. NPC or even, yes, PC. vs. PC.<br/><br/>In particular notice how this rather simply solves the problem of two players endlessly bickering in character about something without resorting to bullying one of the two players either socially or systematically.  As soon as the two characters (in the fiction) are in an argument go to Will vs. Will.  We now instantly know who has the upper hand in the argument.  The loser can either go, \u201cI lost the argument, fair enough\u201d and comply with appropriate behavior OR if he\u2019s STILL committed to \u201chis way\u201d he has to switch tactics to something other than arguing (or at minimum a new course of argument) and the winner has victory dice to oppose that new tactic if he so chooses.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133021/#Comment_133021" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T14:57:26+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  2:57PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2008 3:02PM by Chris Peterson.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Here\u2019s the key point: The GM is free to narrate ANY follow up action on the part of the woman he wants.

Rather reminds me of Burning Wheel/Empires Duel of Wits which do pretty much exactly the same, albeit in a more formally structured way.<br/><br/>*Most of the players I've played Sorcerer with have been uncomfortable (uneasy, unsure) with letting the system handle social conflict, maybe it's trad gamer baggage, they'd rather "roleplay it out".

The post I'm composing about how the system relates to the narrative addresses this in full but I'll try to get at the core of the idea here.<br/><br/>It's bad form in Sorcerer to repeat an action.  You CAN do it but you take a cumulative -1 penalty for each repeated attempt.  So let's say the GM has the woman try run away but the man succeeds in catching her arm.  I COULD have her try to run away again at a -1 but that's kind of lame.<br/><br/>Again it's hard to describe without actually playing but each subsequent success the man achieves by chaining victories narrows the legitimate creative choices the GM has.  The next tactic I might try is call the bouncer over cause this guy is harassing me.<br/><br/>The situation is constantly evolving in some manner and not just stubbornly treading water until one side gets what it wants.<br/><br/>It's a very different thing creatively and socially then fiat.  <br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133030/#Comment_133030" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T15:09:59+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  3:09PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Chris Peterson</cite><br/>Does the reverse situation make sense? e.g. the man loses his "go home with me" roll and then the player (not the GM) insists that the woman goes home with him?</blockquote>\nWhat you're missing is that a) the situation has to change and b) the follow up tactic has to be narratively different.  The player can't just "insist" that would incur a cumulative -1 penalty each subsequent roll he's just insisting.  He would have to change tactics.

All the In a Wicked Age threads around here suddenly made a light bulb go off above my head about <i>Sorcerer</i>'s mechanics. <br/><br/><br/>Hi Chris,<br/><br/>Here's a way of thinking about it that makes sense to me (and Jesse is the one who broke this out for me):<br/><br/>In a Social Conflict, no one roll can <i>make</i> any character (PC or NPC) do anything.  So even if a Will vs. Will conflict is lost, there is still choice there.  How?  Well, the choice is this: a) accept defeat or b) try a new tactic, knowing that any action you take will be at Penalized Dice or Bonus Dice for the opposing players action, however it gets played.<br/><br/>This means that a player of a character can CHOOSE to not give in, but always at the cost of the next action leading further and further to guaranteed failure.  I find this option -- leaving open the choice of accepting a Will challenge, but knowing the odds get worse the further I do this -- to be pretty cool.  It means no one gets sandbagged into any behavior because of Dice Roll, but to play against another character's Victory gets harder and harder.<br/><br/>In my experience it doesn't play as fiat as much as <i>choice</i>.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133049/#Comment_133049" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T16:59:42+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  4:59PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Great Wolf</cite>Jesse,<br/><br/>You know, the more that you describe Sorcerer, the more I understand In a Wicked Age.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf</blockquote>\nGlad to see that I'm not the only one with that thought.<br/><br/>Jesse -- this is fabulous stuff!

That's why you don't take damage AND have the victories of the attack roll over to your next action.  That roll over is accounted for in the damage.<br/><br/>There is no such equivalent in social conflicts.  However, I would say, yes, if you're rolling over more dice than the woman has Will that's a pretty good indication creatively that things have gone a little far.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133106/#Comment_133106" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T21:58:00+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  9:58PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Next thread:<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5952" rel="nofollow">[Practice: Sorcerer] Conflict &amp; Inanimate Objects</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133256/#Comment_133256" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T11:41:45+00:00" title="March  7, 2008 11:41AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>In particular notice how this rather simply solves the problem of two players endlessly bickering in character about something without resorting to bullying one of the two players either socially or systematically.

It's lame to you, it's lame to me.  Sorcerer assumes a player commitment to not being lame.  It assumes you're invested in the drama.  It assumes that as the drummer or the base player or the lead singer you're not going to be an asshole and start just banging on shit without listening to your fellow players.<br/><br/>And that's not the same thing as rule 0 or fiat.  Just like having us stand around humming together is not the same thing as handing you a base, taking drums for myself and giving Christopher a microphone.<br/><br/>There comes a very obvious point socially where it stops being, "I'm really invested in the dynamics of the situation" to "I'm just being a frustrating dick."<br/><br/>Note: I have seen people take the -1 penalty for a roll or two BECAUSE they were very invested in a particular tactic working.  It was obviously a creative choice when it happened and not just a dick move.  When it worked out, awesome, when it didn't they've had the sense to say, "Damn.

Mostly I want to keep talking -- and I really can't do that if we slide into negativity.<br/><br/>I think there's a lot of territory between "creative vision" and who's on board with it and what happens in this scene, with these characters, right here, and right now.  You and I could both be totally on board with our Raymond Chandler noirfest murder mystery that we're playing, and we can still disagree on, for instance, when the investigator finally breaks and despairs for the morality of the world.  This becomes a problem when you're playing the investigator and I'm playing the alluring love interest, and we're in a scene that I really want to be a watershed... and you don't, because you want the <em>next</em> scene, where the investigator confronts the conspiring government official, to be when he breaks.<br/><br/>Making sense?  I think it's more than possible to have a difference of opinion on the specifics while still agreeing on the big picture.<br/><br/>Jesse -- Rockers need instruments to rock.  Storytellers do not need dice to tell a story.  Rockers use a guitar because the guitar makes sound that their vocal chords cannot.  What do the dice give the storytellers that they can't produce on their own?<br/><br/>I can buy Alan's answer, but his answer seems contrary to what you've been saying thus far.  Dice as a challenge, as a destabilizing force, that prods us in directions we would not normally have taken -- seems at odds with the jazz band.  The upright bass never decides to play notes that the bassist didn't play...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133362/#Comment_133362" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T15:47:20+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  3:47PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes sense, Josh.

You can't go into a scene wanting it to be the big show down with the villain.  You can't go into a scene wanting it be the reflective angsting scene.  You can't decide on the story function of a scene in advance.  You will be sorely disappointed.
