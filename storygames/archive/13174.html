So, suppose you start with the theme first and make a new system to handle it. What stops you from releasing that system under the OGL?

That said, if the system modification rules are too strict in the OGL (it's been a long time since I've read it and I don't remember how much you're allowed to throw away from the system you are forking from) I can totally see what you're talking about.  <br><br>I think the combination of FATE and D&amp;D isn't going to happen (regardless of them both being OGL) because FATE is kind of crappy at doing a D&amp;D style game and vice versa.  Better to make a fantasy game that works with FATE than a game about increasing your power (which is what D&amp;D is about) in an engine that doesn't support it.<br><br>EDIT: beaten by Wordman.

I tried Kickstarter too, but they don't accept people without a US bank account. I think there is also quite an element of luck involved. (And let's not forget that Diaspora is an *exceptional* example that has won one award and, I believe, been nominated for several others.)<br><br/>Art is rather a personal bugbear of mine. If I'm going to release a game, I want it to look at least halfway professional.<br/><br/>But let's not stray too far away from the purpose of the thread here.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297196/#Comment_297196" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-18T05:42:45+00:00" title="October 18, 2010  5:42AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 18, 2010 5:48AM by jenskot.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been talking to different groups of hardcore Pathfinder GMs and players... trying to get an idea if they would like FATE and what they don't like about D&amp;D; 4E. There seem to be invisible lines that if crossed, will lead to rejection.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of the people I've spoken to loved Iron Heroes (which Mike Mearls designed) but hate D&amp;D; 4E (which Mike was involved in and has similarities). The reason given is that Iron Heroes gave more choice where 4E took choice away and prescribed 1 specific way to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake meta resources like Action / Hero / Fate points. These Pathfinder fans love them if they are something you earn (rather than start with). And HATE them if they can be spent on a roll after you know the results. If you failed... you failed and they don't want to cheat. Points also giving a flat bonus is less interesting and feels more like cheating compared to a point that gives you a bonus die to add to your roll. Pathfinder just released Hero Points in the Advanced Players Guide but many hardcore are sticking to Monte Cook's Action Points which uphold many of the values described above.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, they hate miss effects! They hate spells doing half damage and they really hate how in D&amp;D; 4E so many standard and frequently used powers have missed effects. You failed but you still get something. They hate it! It feels cheap. It's so weird to me because those things make D&amp;D; waaay more fun for me. But that's just my tastes. In fact, many of them love the critical failure decks Pathfinder released. If you fail big, they want the option to fail even more by drawing from the optional deck. And when they win big... they want the chance to win even bigger! They dislike Fallout from Dogs in the Vineyard because benefiting from damage feels like cheating. The players also frequently refer to the DM as Ref which probably says something. But they aren't looking for direct competition!<br/>\n<br/>\nMinis are ok as long as they are an option, not a requirement. And they don't want too many choices, they felt D&amp;D; 4E had too many choices that bogged the game down. But they love choices when you make your character or level up. They love, LOVE feats and pouring through books looking for the right feat. Although they love smaller concise skill lists.<br/>\n<br/>\nStory seems to be the priority but story usually means an overarching meta plot the DM constructs. I couldn't get a straight answer if character flaws were cool. Like using an Aspect against yourself or the DM compelling your aspect. They don't like using Traits against yourself in Mouse Guard but that may also be because the benefit isn't immediate where in FATE the benefit is immediate. I'm going to run FATE for them and see how they react. Character goals are another issue. They don't seem comfortable defining them and when they do XP is not seen as a motivating award. Most of the groups don't seem to actually track XP closely (or at all, same with encumbrance) and again it isn't immediate enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeta seems to be an ugly word but everyone admits that Hit Points is meta for them but they are used to it. They hate that armor adds to your AC and doesn't absorb damage. And while no one seems to directly admit it, they are ok with the DM cheating in their favor behind their screen. They like that the rules are crunchy and give many options that really help them imagine their character but at the same time are ok with the DM winging it and prematurely killing monsters even though they have 40 hit points left. Everyone thinks combat is too long but don't like 1 roll resolution systems. And they don't like keeping track of effects. So many effects in D&amp;D; 3 last 1dX rounds or X minutes. When you have enough of these effects in play, people lose track and start faking it. But they don't seem to like the D&amp;D; 4E answer where at the end of your turn you roll a d20 and have a base 50% chance of shaking off an effect. So you don't keep track, a roll at the end of your round instead determines how long things last. I love the D&amp;D; 4 approach and the people I spoke don't hate it, just seem hesitant.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's been interesting! D&amp;D; isn't just a game. It's a culture and people's childhoods. One of the reasons Pathfinder is seen as the true heir to D&amp;D; is because they use many of the old D&amp;D; writers as freelancers to work on Pathfinder. And because Paizo worked on Dragon Magazine. For many of the die hard pathfinder fans, Dragon Magazine was more D&amp;D; than D&amp;D; was if that makes sense. It was edition independent. And the Online version of Dragon Magazine is viewed as being fake and 100% marketing driven. So in many ways Pathfinder is actually D&amp;D; for them and D&amp;D; 4E is a D&amp;D; Tactics side game to be sold with their mini line. That said, they love the Castle Ravenloft boardgame, so it isn't like they can't play tactical games.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt should also be noted everyone I've been speaking to is 30 years and older. I haven't met any teenagers that play Pathfinder but I know many that love D&amp;D; 4E. Interesting times!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305608/#Comment_305608" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-22T15:06:30+00:00" title="December 22, 2010  3:06PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tulpa</cite>He shouldn't have OGL'ed it then.</blockquote>\nHe didn't have a choice.
