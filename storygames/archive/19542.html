So you gotta be careful.  That said, I think the best way around that is to give everybody a different specialty, maybe not "superpower" but very useful in various types of situations.  And then toss in situations where each character gets a chance to use their specialty, maybe even whole little side-adventures, while the Prophet is busy with less worldly things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Oren" title="Oren"><img alt="Oren" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Oren">Oren</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434451/#Comment_434451" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-27T03:03:58+00:00" title="June 27, 2014  3:03AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2014 3:04AM by Oren.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Kingdom, some characters have the authority to make decisions, and the rest simply don't.

As a GM you do tend to end up with encounters weighted so the Slayer has foes they can best while the white hats have easier opponents and if the Slayer chooses badly at the start of the encounter the white hats main job is to stay alive until rescued. Equally it's a system where final death is somewhere between difficult and impossible to attain.<br/><br/>When going for it in the set up I'd suggest you need to be sure that the players will be comfortable with both the situation, and who is playing what. A sympathetic player as the prophet is going to look to share plot and limelight with the other players and ease the job of the GM, someone who lets the power go to their head is going to be harder work. Be careful of making the other characters too fantastic, 1st ed Victoriana does this, upper class characters get loads of social bonuses in game but to balance it with the points spend lower class characters all end up as near super heroes. It doesn't make sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434456/#Comment_434456" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-27T08:36:00+00:00" title="June 27, 2014  8:36AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While playing our hack of 3:16 we had the character with the higher NFA as the sergeant and the character with the higher FA as corporal, and while there was a sorta chain of command, I loved the way the game states that this just means that the PCs have different responsabilities and put everyone in a different problem. The soldiers have to follow ordes and kill everything in sight. The corporal has to follow orders and help everyone be in the right place to do their work. The sergeant has to follow orders and make sure everyone comes back alive.<br/><br/>Yet at the end of the session we had a sorta epilogue where everyone stated their report, which worked as a way to vote if the corporal and sergeant charges went to another player in the next session. It also worked quite good, the players who were terrible leading despite their stats went back to soldiers and the ones who kept complaining just to kick out the ones in charge got the unit command and saw for themselves what it all meant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434465/#Comment_434465" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-27T12:24:50+00:00" title="June 27, 2014 12:24PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, thanks for all the suggestions. <br/>So, this confirms that <i>all</i> players need spotlight after all to be happy.

(I know, I know. Sometimes they're clich\xe9s for a reason)<br/><br/>The prince was clearly the main character, but the game worked brilliantly nonetheless for a couple of reasons:<br/><br/> - Everyone was cool with this premise from the beginning. The player of the prince wanted to play a "face" character and everyone else had a solid, enjoyable concept that didn't require them to be front-and-centre in the public eye.<br/><br/> - Everyone apart from the prince got their own dedicated sub plot, so there was always interesting stuff tied directly to them even if they weren't the driving force of the main plot.<br/><br/> - Everyone apart from the prince had their own specialist skill that set them apart, so sometimes they <i>were</i> the driving force of the main plot.<br/><br/> - Mechanically, the prince played a supporting role, so when he excelled he was also directly causing someone else to be awesome as well.<br/><br/><b>Witch: the Road to Lindisfarne</b> deals with a single central interestingly, by having her be the one under threat the entire time and giving her different agendas from the rest of the players in framing scenes and describing atmosphere.<br/><br/>There's also probably much to be learned from various Doctor Who games, but admittedly I haven't actually played any so couldn't give a recommendation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434477/#Comment_434477" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-27T14:55:54+00:00" title="June 27, 2014  2:55PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe there was a Doctor Who game like this as well...can't remember for sure though.<br/><br/>There are a lot of ways to interpret a 'powerful leader'. <br/><br/>Are they numerically superior (higher level, better stats/equipment, etc)? Are the plot central (the exiled prince example from above)? Are they group caller/leader (ie meta)? Are they somehow player superior (parent in a group of kids)? Are they a financial backer or architetect/strategist with little else to offer?<br/><br/>Each would have different benefits and pitfalls. In the end, of course, it's mostly about the group and what they're interested in playing. In one group I've been with for a long time two of the players preferred to stay quiet and be along for the ride, while the other two took the spotlight - one as a power-gamer beating the rolls and one as a roleplayer/plot driver. Because that's what they wanted to be there was seldom reason to try and force equality.<br/><br/>Really I've never heard an idea that won't work on a limited basis (right group, one-shot game, etc). Such things don't always equate to a broadly popular ongoing game however.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434488/#Comment_434488" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-27T17:43:16+00:00" title="June 27, 2014  5:43PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the case of your setup, would it work to separate authority and competence?<br/><br/>For instance, if one character is a prophet, word of god, and all that, maybe his followers are the ones with the actual skills?<br/><br/>For instance, playing a powerful Prince alongside his bodyguard (who must protect the weak, inexperienced Prince) makes for an interesting dynamic balance, because the Prince has the authority and the power, but the bodyguard has the means to save his life - and, in theory, the power to take things into his own hands.

He could just as easily be the Touchstone, who gets to exemplify how the rest of the folks in the Kingdom (in this case, the cult as a whole) feel about what\u2019s going on. Or the Perspective, who gets to predict what will happen as a result of deciding one way or another on the Crossroads. For extra fun, it helps to know that these roles aren\u2019t <em>fixed;</em> another player can challenge you to take your role or you can willingly give it up to take on another. The Chosen One going from Authority to Perspective is a perfectly sensible process that changes the influence over the story and the dynamic without changing <em>his identity.</em><br/><br/><strong>Kingdom</strong> works just fine for one-shots. Pick one of the <em>really</em> compelling Crossroads and push hard on the threat of Crisis (which is what happens if the direction of the Kingdom itself gets too far out of sync with the peoples\u2019 interests and inevitably ends in a situation that can destroy the Kingdom as a whole), and you\u2019re gone.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6A7E9AE395D8C3EF" rel="nofollow">You can see some live play of <strong>Kingdom</strong> on my YouTube Channel. </a>. I suggest the <em>New Avalon</em> games as they are multi-session, multi-Crossroads play, but there are several one-shots in there, too.

After the customization is done, what thoughts goes through your mind in how to set up a scene?</blockquote><p>One of the key understandings is that <strong>Kingdom</strong> is GM-less, the first phase where you and your fellow players create characters is going to drive a lot. Even in the absence of numeric quantification, there are important things about your character that\u2019ll drive your eventual scene setting. Of particular note is that every player\u2019s character is explicitly defined with where they\u2019re most likely to be found, what their wish or fear about the Kingdom\u2019s future, what personal issue that they have that holds them back, and some kind of relationship to the character played by the person on your left. In particular, the wish/fear is a huge driver of some initial direction, in part because once characters are created, the next step is for the first player to create a Crossroads, an essential question about what the Kingdom is going to do. Making up a good one generally involves paying attention to the other characters\u2019 wishes and fears, and hitting several of them at once.</p><p>Instant hooks.</p><p>Once that first Crossroad is created, it drives the scenes that follow. They should all be about what your character thinks or does about that Crossroads. So, as an example, if the Crossroad is, \u201cDo we hang the Betrayer before he has a chance to give up the Chosen One according to prophecy?\u201d that\u2019s probably going to be a huge hook for anyone interested in or fearful about the future of the religion. The Authority will give orders to the Kingdom about things that do happen, the Perspective will give predictions about things that will happen as a result, and the Touchstone will have things to say about what the folks outside the inner circle think about it and can push everything hard to Crisis if their interests aren\u2019t seen to.</p><p>(Things get even more interesting [or \u201cinteresting\u201d] when there is more than one person with a given Role, which can absolutely happen \u2013 and when no one does. Hint: The latter can go badly, very quickly.)</p><p>So, for myself, when I\u2019m hitting that Scene creation, I\u2019m thinking about <em>what my character wants,</em> which I\u2019ve already thought about and which everyone else knows, and I think about how the Crossroads intersect with that, and then <em>I push hard on it.</em> I pull other peoples\u2019 interests and oppositions into the Scene so that there\u2019ll be tension and conflict. I give other folks a chance to be awesome while definitely pursuing my character\u2019s goals. <strong>Kingdom</strong> is a game that really supports playing a character that is at odds with other characters (or all the other characters) as long as you\u2019re all interested in the continuance of the Kingdom itself.</p><p>Definitely check out our videos if you have the time. There was a lot of fun being had. I <em>suspect</em> that this coming Saturday we\u2019ll be playing <strong>Kingdom</strong> again in the <em>700 Horsepower</em> setting, so there might be more of it to be had.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434529/#Comment_434529" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-28T22:59:40+00:00" title="June 28, 2014 10:59PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2014 11:00PM by BeePeeGee.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The discussion turned out to be really fruitful.

Especially, if the leader/champion is really <i>vulnerable</i>, this gives the side-kicks a lot of competence and important tasks, i.e. protect their leader, represent him in public, cover up his weaknesses etc.<br/>I'm thinking of giving the leader several Fate-style "Trouble Aspects".<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">@SquidLord</a>: Wow, great write-up!
