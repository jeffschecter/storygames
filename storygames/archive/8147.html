Maybe people here will be a little more helpful.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>I started a game today with a batch of pregens, which resulted in three of the players picking pregens, and two making characters- both Shifters. One of the pregens was a Warforged, so we've got a pretty interesting party (the other characters are a Tiefling Pyromaniac Wizard, and a Half-Elf (Half-Drow) Dark Warlock.)<br/><br/>So, I think most of the monster manual races are fairly underpowered compared to the base races, except maybe the kobold and minotaur. Part of this is a lack of special feats, but most of them get fewer abilities, and an incomplete writeup.<br/><br/>Some basic around the board buffs:<br/>Everyone gets two racial skills and two languages. If they get Common only normally, the second language is up to the player.<br/><br/>For the Warforged, Living Construct and Warforged Resolve both seem decent- very passive abilities, generally. I added Intimidate as a second racial skill (they're built for war, and both the warforged monsters have it.) For the character in my game, it's a minotaur-built warforged, so I gave it the Oversized. (But I probably wouldn't do so for all warforged.)<br/><br/>(It was pointed out to me that DDI had an updated to the warforged, which I'll likely use for human built warforged, but keep this version for a minotaur-built warforged.)<br/><br/>For my shifters (one of each type), I'm thinking of a Keen Sense of Smell type power. Either:<br/><br/>Keen Scent: You gain a +2 racial bonus to Perception. When blinded, enemies only have concealment, not total concealment.<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>Keen Scent: You gain a +4 racial bonus to Perception where scent is relevant. When blinded, enemies only have concealment, not total concealment.<br/><br/>I'm on the fence about this- the former might be too general, whereas the latter might be too specific and difficult to adjudicate, especially since D&amp;D doesn't seem to focus on sense-distinction.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179279/#Comment_179279" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-19T04:48:21+00:00" title="November 19, 2008  4:48AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Warforged: WotC did a complete race write-up somewhere... guess it's somewhere on D&amp;DInsider.<br/><br/>Monster Manual races underpowered? Maybe... But increased variety, IMHO, results a power boost when optimizing. Basically, if you're min-maxing and cherry-pick a MM race, that's because it's the most powerful race <b>for your build</b>. So I wouldn't worry too much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179348/#Comment_179348" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-19T13:43:08+00:00" title="November 19, 2008  1:43PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>As a rule of thumb, I'd suggest that if players want to play them, then they're not underpowered.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179456/#Comment_179456" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-20T09:30:39+00:00" title="November 20, 2008  9:30AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's one way of looking at it.  But given that neither of them are playing rangers, I think their racial selections are hardly optimized for their builds.  I'm looking to give these players a little something extra, rather than penalizing them gameplay wise for playing something they thought was cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
