We spend one evening designing a game from scratch and one to play it. It's scaled like a parlor larp, but in the immersive scandinavian freeform tradition. We also have a strong narrativist agenda of letting the story flow on its own. And no, it's not Jeepform. Though it shares many traits with that way of playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe used a modified version of the setup method and a three act structure instead of the regular two parter. It turned out really well, we managed to have a wonderful hybrid of story game and larp.<br/>\nThe idea of establishing relationships first, characters second is a great shortcut to a quick start and dramatic conflicts. Prep was a couple of hours and actual play time was a little shorter than that, but we had great fun all the way. We told the story of the last chaotic monthly meeting in a doomed commune that had grown apart. Of course it ended badly, we based it on Fiasco!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can read more on <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://hjernespil.wordpress.com/2011/04/02/fiasco-minilarp/" rel="nofollow">my blog</a> (this is the only english language post, sorry) questions are welcome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318579/#Comment_318579" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-03T13:58:22+00:00" title="April  3, 2011  1:58PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I posted a reply over on your blog - this is a really interesting direction to take the game's subsystems.<br><br>Originally Fiasco was a three-act game, but I ended up truncating the third act and making it into the Aftermath, which works much better in a tabletop setting. Expanding it back out for larp/freeform makes a lot of sense.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
