While I was there, I cracked open a volume of "Gamemastering Secrets". It seemed well put-together, but a few things I saw straight away kind of pushed my buttons. I'm talking about things like "The GM is God" and "never let the players know you're suprised by something unexpected, that they've foiled your plans, or that you're improvising" etc. <br/><br/>I'd like to hear what you people think about a few of the well-known GM advice books out there. The three I'm thinking of are:<br/><br/>1. Gamemastering Secrets<br/><br/>2. Robin's Laws of Good Game Mastering<br/><br/>3. NPC Essentials<br/><br/>So, from a story game perspective, how good/suck are they? Lots of good advice? Lots of outdated advice? Unusual, innovative advice?<br/><br/>If you there are other books you'd like to mention in this context, that's cool, too.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127089/#Comment_127089" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-16T20:21:21+00:00" title="February 16, 2008  8:21PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2008 8:21PM by JDCorley.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Project Management For Dummies is a great GM's book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127103/#Comment_127103" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-16T22:43:21+00:00" title="February 16, 2008 10:43PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have 1 &amp; 2. <br/><br/>I haven't looked into Gamemastering Secrets for a few years, but I recall it had some very good advice and some that wasn't.

As I can't find my copy of Gamemastering Secrets, I will only talk about NPC Essentials.<br/><br/>For a d20 GMing book it's not bad. It talks about NPC roles, and gives good advice on playing D&amp;D Archetypes.  It's was my go to book to help with my brainstorming of D&amp;D NPC's. I loved the charts in the back of the book. And the advice on giving NPC's a secret was good. <br/><br/>I picked it up based on both this <a href="http://www.gamewyrd.com/review/287" rel="nofollow">reviews</a>, and this <a href="http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_7445.html" rel="nofollow">one too.</a><br/><br/>Now compared to story games advice, it does fall short. Although the price / page code was right, compared to other GM Advice books.<br/><br/>Sorry to say NPC Essentials has no advice on playing with bangs, or sharing NPC narration with players. It's still very old school.<br/><br/>On to <i>Play Unsafe</i>, I did find the advice here useful, and gratifying. I found that I was already using some of the ideas contained. It was nice to have my GMing style confirmed. But I got most of that advice from Burning Wheel.<br/><br/>I found that the price / page count <i>Play Unsafe</i> to by way off. It's too short of a book for $20. Really this book should have been submitted to <i>Push</i>. I would recomend to get the PDF, and share print outs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127237/#Comment_127237" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T03:30:33+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  3:30AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Drat, I've just noticed that SG ate my post about Play Unsafe! Suffice it to say that I was being fairly complimentary about it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> It has some great techniques in them: some of which are already part of how I play, but which it was nice to see codified; some of which I doubt I would use (but then the book says exactly that); and some of which are great ideas.<br/><br/>It was too short though. I didn't object to the cost but I was surprised at how slim it was. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
