Where I ask what happened to Ashcans that seemingly never turned into anything.<br/><br/>Today's Segment is Black Cadillacs by Darcy Burgess. A historical war story simulator of some kind. Sounded pretty interesting, you'd play out the experiences of your characters and in some round about manner that eludes me retell those stories years later. A concept that sounded awesome but saw very limited release and discussion, though understandable considering how niche it is. It reminded me of a more artsy version of Kobyashi's Shellshock from way back.<br/><br/>So what happened to it?<br/><br/>note: This will be unlikely to be posted often I just wanted to be stupid and give my post a meaningless format. That and this is a forum not a blog.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448509/#Comment_448509" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-13T11:28:14+00:00" title="September 13, 2015 11:28AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi CynicalSleuth,<br/><br/>For the sake of posterity, here's my version of "Whatever Happened To..."<br/><br/>I don't pretend to be the absolute authority on the topic, and am really interested in others' takes on the subject.<br/><br/>1. There are still one or two procedural wrinkles that haven't been ironed out.<br/>2. This work (finalizing the game design) has taken a back seat to my personal struggles with mental illness.<br/><br/>I'll also use this as an opportunity to correct something.  You said, "you'd play out the experiences of your characters and in some round about manner that eludes me retell those stories years later." which is close to correct, but far enough off the mark to do the game an (unintentional, I'm sure) disservice.<br/><br/>The game plays a lot with themes of memory, truth, and teamwork. The "what you do" portion of play is very straightforward; soldiers stuck in an awful, shitty mess, and the narrative is about what they do to get through it.<br/><br/>All of the games' themes are enshrined mechanically (I like games with lots of what others call "crunch"; I consider this term a double-edged sword. The word is very vague, but oh-so-very evocative!)<br/><br/><i>Memory:</i>  There's a recurring phase of play where players craft flashbacks to their life before being "over there" that explain why the soldier would excel at a certain task, or at the very least, why such a thing would matter to him.  Prime examples of this in film are: Vasili's hunting lessons with his Grandfather in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enemy at the Gates</span> or Reiben's tale of the busty client in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Saving Private Ryan</span>.<br/><br/><i>Truth:</i>  Rumours and innuendo play an active, mechanical role in the game. Every session, the players craft new content that enriches the background of the narrative. The rule for rumours is simple. Re-tell a moment of the game that just happened, but you must change it; exaggerate something, lie about something, or plain old completely change the "why" part of "why it happened".<br/><br/>The teamwork theme takes more time to talk about, so I'll not bore everyone with that.  I mentioned the Memory and Truth themes because I'm betting that they are pertinent to your (incorrect) summary of the the game.<br/><br/>Oh, and yes, it's arty as all hell.<br/><br/>Darcy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
