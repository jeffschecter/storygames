I understand that the game is not about the process of investigating what's wrong in a town, so I shouldn't be trying to play hide the ball with the problems.  However, I can't imagine that it's too much fun to go too far the other way, and have the first NPC the characters meet explain the entire situation to them - in that case, wouldn't every session be extremely short?  So my question is, how do those of you that have run the game in the past parse out information over the course of a session?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chroma" title="Chroma"><img alt="Chroma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/n1N2ZVK30JJ00.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chroma">Chroma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357523/#Comment_357523" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T08:21:40+00:00" title="February  3, 2012  8:21AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2012 8:22AM by Chroma.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: PulpCruciFiction</cite> However, I can't imagine that it's too much fun to go too far the other way, and have the first NPC the characters meet explain the entire situation to them - in that case, wouldn't every session be extremely short?

People in conflict will have very different views, and hence information, about what's "really wrong" and it'll be up to the Dogs to winnow out the seeds and chaff.  Every NPC will want <i>something</i> from the Dogs and will say and do everything they can to get the Dogs to back them up as right.<br/><br/>Scene: a crowd of people clamouring in the town square as the Dogs arrive:<br/><br/>"Thank the King of Life you're here Dogs!!  Brother Matthus killed Steward Thomas, he must be possessed!"  <br/><br/>"Yeah Dog, I killed Steward Thomas, and I'd do it again, he was hurting them Hill People girls down in that camp... and no one would stand against him... King of Life told me to do it..."<br/><br/>"Hill People *spit*, they ain't nothin' but corrupters', they got the Steward, and Matthus both in they's own way, we should burn 'em out, what say ya, Dogs?"<br/><br/>It's dealing with the moral dilemmas that the people of the towns have that's exciting, not digging for clues, that makes Dogs sing as a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357544/#Comment_357544" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T09:54:03+00:00" title="February  3, 2012  9:54AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Every important NPC wants something from the Dogs. Anything they say isn't objective. They will tell "their version" of events to persuade the Dogs to give them what they want. <br/><br/>NPCs may rush to be the first to influence the Dogs. NPCs might start fighting each other so that their enemies can't tell their side. Once the Dogs are seemingly influenced, other NPCs may panic, run, or commit more sin out of desperation. <br/><br/>Often when the Dogs arrive, things have gotten so bad that there aren't people just walking around. There are mobs, lynchings, rituals, sinning, fires, false worship, murder, all happening... maybe all at once... maybe in different place... things are breaking down! <br/><br/>That all said, because Dogs ins't about clue finding, if someone is lying to the Dogs about their version of what's happening... I'll tell the player that the NPC is lying. <br/><br/>The only time I've had a problem with pacing is where there are more than 3 Dogs, and they all stick together, and they all act in unison and agreement. It's happened maybe 4 times early on when I ran Dogs. So I make sure to seed the town with content that will split the party, if not physically, in spirit when there are more than 3 players. Generally 4 players is my favorite but I've had fun with 2-3 players, much less fun with 5 players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357552/#Comment_357552" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T10:13:10+00:00" title="February  3, 2012 10:13AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once you start playing, you'll see how effectively the conflict and escalation rules create major drama on their own.<br/><br/>Things that don't seem like they would be all that much fun can be great in Dogs. <br/><br/>For instance, you have an NPC come up to them and say, "Help us! Someone's killed Sister Abigail, and no one knows who it is!" Then you tell them, "The NPC's eyes are darting this way and that. It's pretty obvious he's lying to you."<br/><br/>Now the Dogs may decide they want to know more. "Wait a minute. Do you know who killed Abigail?"<br/><br/>Bam! You have a conflict. What's at stake is: "Will [NPC] come clean about what they know?"<br/><br/>The dice fly out, maybe harsh words are said, maybe someone gets into a fight... maybe someone even gets killed.<br/><br/>In the meantime, you (as the GM) use your Sees and Raises to bring up other tempting information, implicate other NPCs, feed the Dogs some lies or some inconvenient truths. (Say, at the climax of the conflict, right after one of the Dogs has shot the lying NPC, he whispers with his dying breath: "Sister Abigail called this upon herself, when she drowned the Steward's son in the river after making love to him...")<br/><br/>The game's on! It'll be good.<br/><br/>Just play the NPCs hard, have them push and be desperate in every scene. (Someone's revealing the truth -- or a lie -- to the Dogs? It's going to be in someone else's interest to shut them up. Have them rush in and try to kill the NPC before they can spill their beans!)<br/><br/>And don't worry about the pacing, it'll take its own twists and turns. Most Dogs games, I think, don't really have "pacing": they're pretty much pedal to the floor all the way.<br/><br/>That said, the mechanics take their time to play out. So I would say the pace of Dogs, as long as you keep pushing it along, both with your NPCs (who all want something badly) and your Raises and Sees (milk the drama here!), is relatively slow (it can take 20 minutes to play out a single conflict) but intense and powerful all the way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
