Right? Right. <br/><br/>But how much railroading was there actually? Not asking about what your jerk friend who ran the modules did, let's take a look at the actual modules themselves and find out what they said.<br/><br/>I'm working from the "Dragonlance Classics" collection, 1990.<br/><br/>Dragons of Despair, 1984\n<blockquote>T h e D R A G O N L A N C E \xae saga is a complex epic, filled with detail, legend, and history not found in most modules. To run this adventure properly, you must think of it as a story, and try to motivate your players subtly to follow the right path. It is particularly important that you read the adventure several times, visualize the story, and think about the different things your players might do. No matter what, it will be necessary for you to improvise from time to time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Players and PCs: Don\u2019t feel that you and your players have to march in lock step with the DRAGONLANCE novels!...Though this adventure follows a<br/>fairly set story line, part of your job is to mask this from the players. When only one choice out of several will advance the PCs along in the adventure, use your wiles to subtly make that choice the most logical, most appealing one for your players. Only you can do this, as only you know how to best tantalize your particular group of gamers. This is a test of your skills as a DM\u2014to keep your players interested and to make them believe that they are free to make<br/>any choice they wish.</blockquote>\nSo far it's a lot worse than I remember. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>However, the first few encounters are actually pretty wide open (so long as you accept the premise of the module, that the characters are out searching for "true clerics"). There's a hobgoblin attack, they come across the people they've been looking for; interestingly, there's descriptions of what happens if the players are like "welp, we found her, time to just pack it in and randomly go somewhere else".  There's a timeline (mostly discussing how the weather changes and what an approaching army does) but the PCs can go wherever they like during that time frame.<br/><br/>The only bit of railroading that actually occurs in Chapter 1 is more of a magician's force:\n<blockquote>Whenever the PCs enter an area, the designated encounter takes<br/>place at once. Some areas have the same number; this is to create a further sense of certainty as your players follow their journey across their unnumbered map. If the PCs cross from one encounter area into another with the same number, simply repeat the encounter.</blockquote>\nEnh, doesn't seem too bad. You go to this area and a thing happens there.<br/><br/>There's a couple of kind of mechanical-type things that might be perceived as railroading when it's not, interestingly.  There's an elven forest where if the PCs go there and start a ruckus, they more or less have to just keep fighting the elven army forever (or until the PCs retreat), but that's because the elves have mustered up a big army to fight the other army that's roaming around the land. This information can be discovered by the player characters but might not be; they may just stumble into the situation and pick a fight without knowing why it seems like they're fighting a huge army.<br/><br/>Chapters 2-4 is a swamp temple location adventure. No railroading here. I guess maybe a little bit of "artificiality" insofar as there's an escaped prisoner who is roaming around causing trouble when the PCs get here (no matter when they get here), but enh.<br/><br/>So in the first module there's really solid/direct advice to railroad the players/actively trick them, but in the module itself there really isn't any "forced choice" of that kind. A little weird; I can definitely see where it would cause a problem, insofar as a DM might just <i>decide</i> which way the PCs need to go and use that advice to make them go that way even though the module is fine whether or not they go there. <br/><br/>The path to the adventure location is actually quite well directed given the initial setup of the game. The characters are searching for a "true cleric" for their own various reasons; that true cleric has with her a crystal staff. The bad guys are searching for the crystal staff to destroy it, the good guys want to find out the powers of the staff and use it to destroy the bad guys. The PCs can't possibly avoid learning of the importance of the staff no matter where they go on the map, either some good guy is going to say "dude, we need this staff to stop the bad guys" or "bad guys came through here wrecking shit looking for this staff, this is bad man", or some bad guy is going to yell "tell me everything you know, where's the crystal staff" or "man the boss is going to be mad as hell if we don't wrap up this crystal staff shit soon", and there's cool clues and rumors that really point them hard towards the location of the "dungeon" (there's several parts to it.)  Ironically, in terms of "getting the party to the dungeon", I've gotta say that Dragons of Despair does a really solid job of motivating people to go there through many, many different and "natural" means.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445738/#Comment_445738" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-21T22:29:53+00:00" title="June 21, 2015 10:29PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've read the material through several times, never played it. Didn't the first adventure have the first of the many hexcrawls with invisible walls made of unlimited dragonite (or whatever they're called, I forget) encounters to ensure that the PCs don't wander off the map? I think that's more of the sort of thing that people despise about Dragonlance - it came out at a time when the standards for player freedom were really quite high, and particularly the freedom to fail was prized by many people.<br/><br/>To my eyes Dragonlance is aggressively railroading, but its designers realize that this is a controversial design choice, and therefore they do their best to predict and ensure and design the furrow in which the players get to operate so as to soften the blow; they're doing their best to combine epic fantasy literature and roleplaying-as-they-knew-it. Generally the design is most free when the plot is at a low ebb, and most constricting where the setpiece encounters and "gotta get the PCs from point A to point B under time limit" transitions occur. In between the plot material there is a lot of old school D&amp;D content, though, such as small hexcrawls (really somewhat sandboxy at times, if you ignore the invisible walls made of automatic monster encounters) and various dungeons and so on.<br/><br/>We could quibble about the terminology, of course, but it's an old work, and at the time people didn't really differentiate between different types of railroading. The offensive part of it is simply the fact that it has an artificially designed funnel at all, which is not usual for an old school D&amp;D campaign, and was probably a methodological error for some play traditions at the time. It was a new thing, and caused confusion, despite generally having more freedom than many later products along the same lines.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445739/#Comment_445739" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-21T22:52:42+00:00" title="June 21, 2015 10:52PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually the thing keeping people on the main map in the first module is time (as far as I can see.)  You literally can't get from the middle of the map to the edge of the map before the armies of the bad guys wash over you. Not to mention the initial setup gives your characters strong incentive to do shit in this area. To some extent, in this initial module, striking out immediately for the edge of the map and not stopping is a refusal to play the module along the lines of "I ignore the villagers' pleas for help and ride on". <br/><br/>And I do NOT think this is a new thing. I have Champions modules from 1978 sitting on my shelves that railroad much more than the first module of Dragonlance does.  It has Always Been With Us.<br/><br/>I'll be on the lookout for those invisible walls in other modules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445740/#Comment_445740" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-21T22:59:21+00:00" title="June 21, 2015 10:59PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do think that the first module does start in a pretty satisfying way.<br/><br/>To clarify my point about the cultural context of Dragonlance, I was mostly thinking about D&amp;D and the play culture internal to that game. In the early '80s there certainly were other games around that had embraced plot-orientation much more than D&amp;D had. Dragonlance was a radical departure for D&amp;D, but perhaps not so much for other games (except in terms of production values, perhaps).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445743/#Comment_445743" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-22T05:14:25+00:00" title="June 22, 2015  5:14AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2015 2:18AM by JDCorley.">edited June 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Somehow I triple posted)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445744/#Comment_445744" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-22T05:14:41+00:00" title="June 22, 2015  5:14AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 22, 2015 2:31PM by JDCorley.">edited June 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, unfortunately I can't comment on the production that much since I'm reading it in reprint form. And I don't have a big collection of early D&amp;D modules so I can't comment on the prevalence of railroading there.<br/><br/>Okay, on to...<br/><br/>Dragons of Flame (1984)<br/><br/>All right, this has the first actual in-module railroading material. The characters, having finished up their location adventure and possessing a very weird prophecy/directive, are meant to be returning to a particular location that they started from to report in. While they were coping with the location, the bad guys have overrun the area. This means that there's probably a pretty good reason to maybe not return home, or to interpret the prophecy/directive in some other way.  But if they do, you are supposed to use Encounter 75:\n<blockquote>Two specks of crimson approach in the far northern sky. As they rush south they grow, forming mighty engines of death\u2014red<br/>dragons. The monsters dive swiftly, and upon their backs sit creatures who seem to be miniature versions of the terrible steeds. The riders\u2019 faces bear a look of serpentine evil: lizardlike faces and cold, gleaming eyes.<br/><br/>The dragons land less than 100 feet away.</blockquote>\n"Hey guys, what's up? We were just..."\n<blockquote>The two old red dragons and their two Kapak riders try to capture the heroes if at all possible, but they are willing to fight to the death.</blockquote>\nOh, okay. <br/><br/>Well, maybe we didn't hang around, but instead went back to the town we started in to check in and make plans for where to go next. Hm, all right, that leads us to Encounter 78 where the bad guys are hassling some innocent lady, if we interfere, they arrest us for brawling, if we don't, they arrest us for trespassing on and looting the adventure location from the first module.<br/><br/>Well, I bet we can fight these guys, they were pretty easy to sneak past to get into the place...\n<blockquote>If the PCs resist, 40 Kapak draconians outside the inn swarm indoors to overcome them.</blockquote>\nOh, okay.<br/><br/>But I bet we can make a daring escape in Chapter 7, right?\n<blockquote>On the way, the PCs learn a few things and, if they are patient, benefit from a timely rescue.</blockquote>\nOh, okay.<br/><br/>Hilariously, to recover your supplies after some elves rescue you (actually they are rescuing another prisoner and the PCs are just along for the ride), you have to fight 16 hobgoblins with only the shortswords you picked up. The mathematical likelihood of this being successful is left as an exercise to the reader. Stunningly, even if you go along with the railroad and flee the slave caravan without fighting these jerks, good old Raistlin is about as useful as a lump because he's got no way to prepare spells! A kindly DM might give the party a chance to re-up in the elven city, I guess, though they're jerked from place to place from the moment they're there being delivered exposition.<br/><br/>Oh, but they don't <i>have</i> to go to the elven city. There's four directions they can take once they do their prison-break.  North they encounter literally infinite badguy patrols and units (this is not necessarily bad design because they've been told by anyone who can talk for the last 5 chapters that this is where the badguy army is), south they have a day of unmolested travel and then encounter the same literally infinite badguy patrols and units (because that's where the badguys are going), east they actually end up at the place where the elves are eventually going to send them. The elven city (where their pal from prison wants to go) is west.  <br/><br/>When I say literally infinite, I mean "there are an infinite number" are words that appear in this module in that order.<br/><br/>But it's cool, the group is most likely to go with their elven prison buddy who helped bust them out because they have safe passage and no supplies and at least the elves will be a bunch of meat shields between them and the bad guys. So whatever, they go to the elf city, hopefully the DM remembers to let everyone resupply, get some plot exposition and then a nice elf lady gets kidnapped by the badguys that have been hassling them all along! The elves want them to go on a quest to get this elf lady back and also to handle some plot related hoo hah.  There's no chance the PCs <i>won't</i> want to kill the guy that's been hassling them for two modules, but if they don't, what happens is hilarious:<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445745/#Comment_445745" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-22T05:15:26+00:00" title="June 22, 2015  5:15AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 22, 2015 2:30PM by JDCorley.">edited June 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (accidental double post)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445746/#Comment_445746" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-22T05:16:35+00:00" title="June 22, 2015  5:16AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>All the priests in the party get a prophetic dream about the elven city being wiped out. If they still don't go "okay, we were just kidding, we'll do your quest" then in 1d6 days the entire area, including the elven city, is taken over by the bad guys and...well, here, read for yourself:\n<blockquote>...no matter which direction the PCs go after one game day they encounter draconians as they did in encounter 94. These skirmishes continue, one every game hour, until all the PCs are dead.</blockquote>\nRemember how that game Vampire: the Masquerade told you to railroad the players all the time, except it didn't? <br/><br/>Weeeellllllll.....this is not the same. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Anyway, the rest of the module is a location-based adventure. A guy tries to infiltrate the group and if he is killed before he betrays the group he is to receive an "obscure death", where the body can't be found; don't ask me how that's supposed to happen, but because there's not actually anything shady for him to do between when he's fake-rescued and when he betrays the party (and there's no mechanical method for people to determine his intentions in AD&amp;D), it's not that big a deal.<br/><br/>The location-based part of this adventure is really interesting: the characters have to manage the rescue of unarmed prisoners, deal with some potential allies (albeit cowardly ones) who can give them intel about how the place runs, and they get to fight their first dragon (maybe even two depending on how things go, but it seems likelier that they'll trick the second one into helping them out, which is even better). Then afterwards there's a mini-game of trying to keep the refugees supplied and protected as they leave the evil citadel and head out. This whole section is very cool actually.<br/><br/>So what the heck happened between the first module and the second? Who can say....there are different authors on them (Tracy Hickman did the first, Douglas Niles did the second)...based on the dates of release, either they were written concurrently or the second raced out the door without the type of playtesting the first got?  Alternately perhaps only the "real" combat sections (in the location bit) got playtested or analyzed for balance.<br/><br/>Let's see how things develop next...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445750/#Comment_445750" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-22T12:42:43+00:00" title="June 22, 2015 12:42PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            uhhh... i think you accidentally your internet...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445751/#Comment_445751" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-22T14:31:39+00:00" title="June 22, 2015  2:31PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, I think I fixed it                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445757/#Comment_445757" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-22T20:46:45+00:00" title="June 22, 2015  8:46PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oof.

If you print a story (module) with a plot (rail lines), then some boundaries are foregone so long as you're going to remain within it. After all there's a finite number of alternatives and preparations you can put down before the thing is financially unstable and no longer able to be printed. (this is all reminding me of previous posts, like the limits on wish spells one, as a cautionary tale)<br/><br/>Not that you can't abandon it completely, because you can do whatever you want. But there are limits to how far you can stretch something while still remaining inside it. Moreover, while you can ad hoc if you have enough knowledge and skill, you'll never achieve much depth or connection that way because those are the aspects which take preparation and careful thought/planning.<br/><br/>For instance, a group of mine was working through a campaign we'd had going a while. We just started a new module in it and the group was being unusually ornery/contrary (even pushing the bounds of their alignments, almost to a man). While I adapted as well as I was able to some truly bizarre choices, eventually we'd reached a point where they were intent upon wholly abandoning the premise and confines of the printed module. I had to say to them "Ok, you'll have to give me a bit to come up with something new then." Then I sat down to write a new adventure on the fly based on their current mood and direction. After about 15 minutes one of the guys actually said to me "man if you weren't ready for tonight you could have cancelled, we would have understood."<br/><br/>*trigger*<br/><br/>Paraphrasing the monologue here: "No, I was completely ready for the adventure we knew we were playing. I have plot connections, contingencies, side adventures, color moments, handouts, and everything else you all come to my games to enjoy. I spent about 20 hours this week preparing it all to make it fun for you guys. However, none of you are here to play that adventure it seems, and that's perfectly fine. But if YOU didn't want to play THIS adventure, then why didn't YOU cancel? Or at the very least, why are you not ok with, and even apologetic about, taking a break while I attempt to whip up something more to your liking at the level of quality that you've grown accustomed to?"<br/><br/>I quickly received a round of apologies and the group agreed they just weren't feeling it that night, so we did other stuff (foam weapon brawls in the back yard and then movies, followed by a walk and philosophical debate as I recall). We then switched to a different game for a couple months, after which they were completely ready to come back to the campaign. We started the module over, and everyone was invested and really enjoyed it. The campaign continued for months after, and was one of our better ones overall.<br/><br/>Point being, if you write a story to be experienced, then THAT is the story that's going to be experienced (at least in part, if only in the background). The details and nuances should be fluid, but the overall story itself is somewhat set (and rightly so). If you would rather make it up as you go along, bravo. However, it becomes an entirely different game experience. Neither is 'right or wrong', but both have to be fully bought into by the entire group or they'll fail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445766/#Comment_445766" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-23T01:22:51+00:00" title="June 23, 2015  1:22AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great story, and I applaud the way you and your group handled it! <br/><br/>And you're certainly right about people needing to buy into a game's basic premise and having an obligation to play in good faith. I think what frustrates a lot of people about the DL modules is that instead of just being like, "Hey, players! You are here to have a grand epic quest that very closely follows the plot of the DL Chronicles trilogy! If you buy into that premise, you will have fun with it!" they instead encourage GMs to engage in an enormous amount of subterfuge... but for that exact same purpose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445769/#Comment_445769" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-23T03:05:33+00:00" title="June 23, 2015  3:05AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2015 3:09AM by JDCorley.">edited June 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a lot of the material was being produced and distributed contemporaneously anyway, so we couldn't actually have "chosen to go along with it" if we wanted to in certain circumstances. (Not to mention the hole I noticed in which if the players DO "go along with it" they lose all their stuff and the wizard, in the module as written, is in a seriously bad position - because the Dragonlance novels didn't follow the AD&amp;D rules for inventory tracking and spell preparation.)<br/><br/>Hey guys, it's <b>Dragons of Hope (1984)</b> - another Tracy Hickman production.<br/><br/>Right away as the module launches, you're in a tight spot - the refugees are fleeing and there's bad guys behind you. You gotta protect em. OH MAN!!! What are you GONNA DOOOOO. This is a really cool setpiece. And then the refugees are organizing politically and they want things from the PCs. Which is really, really interesting. The refugees have reached a precarious compromise position and they now want the PCs to put their plan into effect. I absolutely promise you that the PCs are going to do this, this is presented so effectively. They've been coping with the badguys chasing them since the end of the last module. The refugees mechanical protection and supply are so precarious. These are people the PCs themselves rescued from the bad guys to start.  They are going to grasp at anything they can to protect them. And it's so impossible: they need to find an underground kingdom. And literally nobody knows how to get there.  You could start the campaign right here and feel like this was the epic-est baddest ass craziest insanity.<br/><br/>There's a vicious timetable as well, depending entirely on how awesome the PCs were in the last few modules. If they can't solve this unsolvable problem, all the prisoners the PCs rescued are straight up going to die, every man woman and child and there's a bigger clock starting where the whole world is getting screwed over if you don't wipe your tears and get stuff done. And there's a poem, you all. You're going to die and there's a poem.  <br/><br/>Then some jerk becomes a paladin, whatever.<br/><br/>So, off the PCs go to try to locate something nobody knows where it is, under a time limit and it's for all the marbles. <br/><br/>Railroading: <br/><br/>"Let's go down this ice passage, maybe the dwarf city is there."\n<blockquote>Each turn that the PCs are in this area, they are attacked by eight Baaz draconians who fight until killed.</blockquote>\nOh, okay.<br/><br/>Also the PCs will get killed if they turn back and run into the enemy army. That's not much of a railroad though.<br/><br/>There's four different ways they can find the dwarven  folks, plus some hilarious shit they can get up to on the search.  Other than the ice passage that I mentioned, the only railroading in this section is that really awesome time limit.<br/><br/>Then they come into another interesting location where they come across some dwarves, some older dwarven junk, and some monsters, all in this weird outpost. And they get to fight or otherwise deal with another dragon!  I am absolutely seeing why this module series is so beloved. <br/><br/>There's some reeeeeeaaallllly bonkers/unfair AD&amp;D rooms ("Yeah, an invisible maze, that's a great idea!!!") but no real railroading past this point.<br/><br/>Again, we're seeing a two-part progression to the module: an "overworld" section where things have to be kept on track somehow (though not always by railroading, there's also the timetable and its associated enemy action), and then a location-based section which seems more like a normal AD&amp;D experience.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445770/#Comment_445770" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-23T03:07:47+00:00" title="June 23, 2015  3:07AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's also a gag/joke in which 1d10 refugees and 1d10 wagons of supplies are killed/destroyed.

It's by Tracy Hickman and Michael Dobson.<br/><br/>Weirdly, a guy drinks poison in the first scene. Just kidding I guess he's fighting a guy in a dream realm or something? It says you can't do anything about this or find out about it until the end of the game. Maybe not even then? Makes no sense.<br/><br/>Anywho, the characters are close to their goal, they just have to find the actual underground city and get access to it before the bad guys wipe out the refugees they've been protecting.  They have a bad dream and the main bad guy shows up to taunt them. He flies away before they can do anything serious to him, though. (This is not railroading because hit points and levels exist in D&amp;D.)<br/><br/>They come to a secret door. If the PCs don't find it, an NPC finds it.  Oh. Okay. So much for that goal we were working for the whole second half of the third module. :-/<br/><br/>Anyway, they go underground and there are these dwarves. Some want stuff from the PCs and some are shady who will turn the PCs over to bad guy dwarves for their own purposes. It's kind of neat but a little bit blinkered. I think there's a strong possibility that the PCs will just say "listen, the bad guys are closing in like hell, there's like 4-500 dudes right over there, they need to come in here fast, before we do anything else" which changes both the power differential and the goals for all upcoming encounters.  This possibility is not acknowledged (there is no railroading language directly keeping them from doing it though.)<br/><br/>Assuming the PCs don't try to do this, they go see some other dwarf fellers. They say the PCs need to go fetch some stuff for them in order to obtain safe passage for the refugees. "If the PCs refuse the quest, they are imprisoned." Oh, okay.<br/><br/>Anyway, if they take the quest, then they get taken to a location based adventure and can do whatever they want there. There's a shitty "lol your attempts to do things randomly fail" dungeon section explained by "a dragon/wizard is doing it to fuck with you for no reason".  Which is stupid, but whatever.  <br/><br/>There's a really badass dragon fight, probably the most deadly/highest stakes so far.  They fetch the dingus, and, oh man, there are bad guys everywhere! Run! (Again.) Whether they get captured or not they end up in the now-occupied dwarven city. I sort of raised my eyebrows at this, but I guess they're still underground so there's not that many ways they can go anyway.<br/><br/>Ah, but Dragonlance never lets us down for long on our search for railroading.\n<blockquote>If characters try to go in another direction, they encounter parties of Daergar and draconians that fight to either capture them or force them into the final encounter.</blockquote>\nOh, okay.<br/><br/>Anyway, remember that infiltrating badguy who hasn't done shit the whole time? Well now, the main badguy asks him to turn over the item the PCs grabbed and he does! But if he got killed by someone or whatever, then the main badguy can just telepathically force someone to.  And if that doesn't work then the main badguy just sends one of his guards over to take it.<br/><br/>What a waste of an infiltrator!<br/><br/>Anyway, there's a final battle with people getting taken over by magic items and a ghost dragon lady and the badguys are not as formidable as they were before because the magic crap the PCs have collected turn out to have unexpected effects and now's their chance! It's a real cool D&amp;D battle.<br/><br/>The epilogue can't stop railroading, though. If the PCs try to hang onto one of the magic dinguses that helped them out, it forces them to turn it over to someone else. (There is at least one PC in the group-as-written that could accomplish the goals of the magic dingus as much as the  NPC could but it would take them out of the game, so I guess that can't happen.)<br/><br/>So if the PCs made it through modules 3 and 4 in time to save the refugees, they're heroes! And if they didn't, everyone got murdered and it's all their fault. And there's a marriage! Two of you get married whether you wanted to or not I guess.  Yes, this is the only game that railroads you into marriage that I know of.<br/><br/>There we go everyone. That's the first four Dragonlance modules. What's interesting to me is not the railroading mindset - that's pretty well explained in the introduction - but the haphazard way in which the railroading is pursued. In other words, if this game truly embraced the railroading ethos laid out in the introduction, you wouldn't run into things like an infiltrator that doesn't do anything or a wizard who loses his spellbook, has to fight 4 hobgoblins with a shortsword he doesn't know how to use, and has no opportunity to replace his spellbook for the remaining modules in the arc.  Like, if we were really railroading hard, we might have a couple of tough nights for the wizard and then a rumor of some ancient legendary spellbook in a nearby tomb or whatever.  And the infiltrator might get away with more stuff by having the DM assist them frame someone.  Or a PC might be the one to drink poison and fight the bad guy in the dream realm.

You have a setup, you're given motivations and the first step to it is dropped squarely in your lap in the first scene and no matter where you reasonably choose to go, more or less, you're progressing down a funnel towards the next location in the series.  And the setpiece battles throughout all the modules are really cool! But the railroading to get you there is very clumsy (and often means you will enter the setpiece battle without all your fun options available.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
