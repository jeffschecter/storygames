This is my first game I ever finished and after playtesting it a bit I find it quite playable and fun.<br/>You can find the game on <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/heist_aces" rel="nofollow">1km1kt.net</a> and will be able to read more about it on my blog <a href="http://level27geek.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Level27Geek</a>.<br/>What I would like to do, is to write a non-pocketmod rulebook for the game that will explain the game in more detail, and will be easier to understand for players who are not as versed with story/narrative games. So one player can read the whole book (probably like 20 pages or so) and the rest can play using only the pocketmod.<br/>So I am humbly asking for your opinion and help guys: Is the design even worth expanding? What are some things in the game that are not clear? How can I improve it?<br/><br/>Thanks in advance for any feedback.<br/><br/>P.S Also, I am a constant lurker on here, so it might be a good time to say Hi.... so, Hi! <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cybrasty" title="cybrasty"><img alt="cybrasty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cybrasty">cybrasty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424737/#Comment_424737" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-24T12:07:13+00:00" title="November 24, 2013 12:07PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2013 1:33PM by cybrasty.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have updated the blog with Power19 for the game - available <a href="http://level27geek.blogspot.com/2013/11/heitaces-power-19.html" rel="nofollow">here.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle" title="Erik_Battle"><img alt="Erik_Battle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle">Erik_Battle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424841/#Comment_424841" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-26T15:24:50+00:00" title="November 26, 2013  3:24PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This kind of game is right in my wheelhouse.  I love procedural games that help me tell a story but don't get in the way.  I like the format, but want more.  Not a lot more, just a bit.   After playtesting, how many obstacles work best?  How much time does it cost to add another obstacle in terms of play time?<br/><br/>I like the AW style view of success/partial success.  I also like the way the missions are created like <i>that one spy game I can never remember the name of</i>.  So, I think you have a solid basis.  But, like all things there are things I still want.<br/><br/>I want differentiation of character.  Like Monaco (PC game), I want to be the muscle...or maybe the hacker.  Whatever, I want to differentiate and be the one that the team counts on.  Nobody else can do what I do.<br/><br/>I also would love some lists (loves me some lists).  Lists of obstacles, skills, etc.  I'd pull a bunch from movies and literature.   When I think about this as a game, give me some simple rules and some sparks of ideas (lists!) and I'm off.<br/><br/>And...I want to use this to play Shadowrun...not Ocean's 11.  But, that's just me and I can easily mod it.<br/><br/>Keep playtesting and refining!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cybrasty" title="cybrasty"><img alt="cybrasty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cybrasty">cybrasty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424848/#Comment_424848" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-26T18:15:12+00:00" title="November 26, 2013  6:15PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, thanks for the kind words Eric! I greatly appreciate them.<br/>To answer some of your questions:<br/>I played with 15 and 25 obstacles for my (only 2) playtests. The time difference wasn't big (maybe 2h to run 15, around 2,5 maybe 3 with 25). You'll find that the more obstacles you add, the more often you will call for tests/checks because the obstacles will end close to each other in a narrative way. I will need to run more playtests soon.<br/><br/>I want to add more, and explain the rules more. The biggest problem was that the game as is now, is a 24h creation, so I was limited by both space (pocketmod) and time.<br/><br/>I was thinking about adding special powers per character (Moncao was also my source of this idea <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ). I think I will play with creating some classes/specialities (basically saying - I am the ______ of the group - blank being mucle, hacker etc.) and giving them some cool power to manipulate the cards during certain narrative scenes. I really enjoy the aspect of being the only person in the group who can do the cool thing (and as proven by SCIENCE! it is great for game design/gamification). I was toying with it for 15-20min during the 24h challange, but decided to shelve it for later and now thanks to your comment it will happen for sure!<br/><br/>And lists... oh lists <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I can confirm that they will be there, I toyed with putting word clouds (like the one on the cover) in the pocketmod, but again - lack of space. Now for the full blown pdf rulebook (I say like it will be a 300 pages book, it won't I want to keep it small and accessible - so no more than 24 pages) Would you have anything against lists as word clouds? Would you rather have them as lists as the few in the book now ( .[item1] .[item2] ...)?<br/><br/>How do you feel about a small pocketmod rulebook with a companion book (that will explain the quirks of the system and expand the game) - do you think it is a good idea, or would you rather have me stick to a pocketmod?<br/><br/>And Shadowrun is a great setting for running heists (runs), one playtest I run was setup in cyberpunk-like setting - so I can confirm it works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
