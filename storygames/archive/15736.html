Just thought I'd record a few responses:<br/><br/>* Character creation is fast and gives you a lot of canned reason for being and adventurer in the region in which the game is set. Its one of the many benefits of having such a focused design.<br/><br/>* The book is poorly organized and fails to make it clear just how things work. If we all had taken the time to do a solid read through, I don't know how much of a problem this would have been, but its definitely not made to be a learn-as-you-go process. This is a shame considering how elemental the system is.<br/><br/>* Travel was boring when we were making checks and some of the outcomes didn't seem to matter once the travelling was done, but the actual fights and decision points that ensued were really fun. A streamlined version of the travel rules would be awesome.<br/><br/>*There's a lot of mechanical weirdness 1) isn't that bad, and really just comes from a superficial similarity to D&amp;D and other similar games and 2) its all actually very clever.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356923/#Comment_356923" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T08:25:48+00:00" title="January 31, 2012  8:25AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having ruminated a bit more about the session, it seems the game had two strong weakness, maybe because of our playgroup and maybe because of inherent system-y type things:<br/><br/>* There wasn't a good way to indicate which player had the right to speak when. Social situations were a little messy as everyone talked over each other until someone started off on a little monologue. I felt like I had to either be pushy and dominate scenes in order to get face time, or I had to sit out entirely so that they other players were clear that it was there turn to talk.<br/><br/>* About mid-session our efforts were focused on trying to investigate the possible location of the Brown Wizard. It felt like we just kept going back and forth between a) nothing happening and b) bald exposition. I'm sure in large part this was to do with the way the GM was handling everything, but the system didn't seem to offer solid guidelines on how to use skills or clearly gauge their results.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
