I imagine this kind of thread would be a little like a self help group. <br/><br/>I need some feedback from the community and more specifically the administrators about whither this kind of thread is allowed. Please comment and help settle this. <br/><br/>Thanks!

Do that here.<br/>Designing a rules hack, optional setting, reskinning for an existing game: That's play-focused talk (and usually "GM Stuff").Do that on Story-Games.<br/><br/>If you have a discussion that is for the players (GMs, houserulers, hackers), talk about it on Story-Games.<br/>If you have a discussion that is for the designers, talk about it here.<br/><br/>If you have a discussion that truly straddles both sides of the community, create two threads and cross-link. Or focus on one site. It doesn't really matter, these are 1-in-50 corner cases anyway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I looked at the Praxis site and it also doesn't seem to fit what the accountability check in is about. Accountability is not game design - it could cover anything the person is working on. For example - my check in commitment was to get my web page products up dated. Another person's check in myght be to sit down a write for 30 minutes in the next week. <br/><br/>What do you think? Does putting this activity in a new forum make it harder for people who need this kind of support to find it? I know I feel a little weird posting on a new game design forum when my games are not new and are really fully designed.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242736/#Comment_242736" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T11:18:21+00:00" title="November 19, 2009 11:18AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I'm not enforcing a huge split here or anything... yet. That's why the Game Design Help forum is still open here (eventually I'll be migrating it whole over to Praxis). Praxis is still in "Beta" and all that.<br/><br/>Basically, Story Games is for what people do when they play games. Praxis is for what people do when they write, market, or sell games. There's a tiny bit of spillover here and there, hence the "if you can't decide, go ahead and make a thread on each forum" clause.<br/><br/>All the stuff that you mentioned in your own post is kind of what I think probably fits better in the Praxis forum, likely under the "General Design Blather" category (the catch-all), or probably better yet under the "Promotion and Inspiration" category, since the topic seems to be about encouraging inspiration in regards to Getting Things Done: New games, writing, websites, marketing, layout, and so on.<br/><br/>The topic would probably fit on Story Games only if it was accountability somehow tied to playing, GMing, organizing events, and so on. "I will update one wiki page every week for our weekly campaign!", "I will read Game X and make up two PCs per week for the next 2 weeks in prep for the next campaign!" and the like.<br/><br/>Make sense?<br/><br/>Also, as a thread, it's a cool idea. I know we've done them for short bursts in the past here (in the Game Design Help forum, and again about things related to designing, marketing, promoting, fixing, editing/laying out games), so another stab at one is always welcome!<br/><br/>Just to get things started without forcing you to go back and do the work, I'll recreate your thread over there: Again, I'm not really out to enforce broken rules or anything, but I'm doing this more of a chance to see if Praxis has legs: To get more eyes on it, and more folks interesting in that field contributing to threads like that.
