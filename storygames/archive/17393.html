It does seem that networking is an important part of reaching some critical mass of visibility.<br/><br/>In retrospect I should have tried a kickstart for a number of reasons, but its a bit late now - its published!  But funny to think that a Kickstarter where you pays your money in the hope of seeing a product eventually would be better received than paying your money to receive the product immediately.   I tend to think a Kickstarter would end up failing for the same reasons the game itself is failing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393846/#Comment_393846" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-18T23:35:29+00:00" title="October 18, 2012 11:35PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 18, 2012 11:38PM by Mcdaldno.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stefoid,<br/><br/>I think you've done plenty of forum promotion. I think this is the fourth (?) thread I've seen about Ingenero in the past couple weeks, with three (?) of them authored by yourself. If I recall correctly, some of those threads contributed value to a discussion, and others felt like more basic linking-out promotion.<br/><br/>I can only speak for myself, but: Ingenero is on my radar. I know that it exists. I have read some stuff about it, and reached an unfounded-but-valid conclusion as a consumer: "This seems neat enough, but it's not something I need." That's common: most games fall into that category for me.<br/><br/>At some point, you made the strong choice to differentiate from other universal systems by saying it "creates drama similar to Game of Thrones" (or something like that; I'm too lazy to look it up). I think that's a strong move, because saying "it can do anything" doesn't actually create buy-in for games, whereas a tailored experience does. So: continue doing this - marketing the specific experiences your game can offer.<br/><br/>So, you've done promotion, you've engaged in conversations about your game, and you've made it clear what tailored experiences your game can offer. Good. I think that continuing to post more threads about Ingenero and to prompt sales-pitch-y review threads from others may be counter-productive. It can feel like spam and like leeching.<br/><br/>So, what next? Some things that work for some people: run your game at lots of conventions, enthusiastically engage any people who report having played your game, donate copies of your game to reviewers, wait patiently, refocus your goal away from "market success" and toward "having fun at your own table." These aren't mutually-exclusive things. You can try doing any or all of them.<br/><br/>It's also possible that, and I say this with solemnity and compassion, this might not be the game that people are interested in. I've had designs that I loved that others didn't. The thing to do then is probably: continue to feel proud of your publishing endeavor, treat yourself to a fancy dinner as self-accolade, and have a critical think about whether you're still feeling excited about game design. And if you are, then fuck the haters, get to work on some more designs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393851/#Comment_393851" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T00:44:42+00:00" title="October 19, 2012 12:44AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're not connected it takes time to reach an audience.

I hear what you're saying about not having time to forum-surf because you're spending that time actually making your game. I have the same problem, but I accept that if I were to just jump into a forum with a post about my game before I'd contributed in any meaningful way to the debates I would get pretty short shrift from folks. In fact that's precisely what I did do on this and a couple of other forums; I've learnt from this error, which is principally one of etiquette- it's like turning up to a party and expecting to be warmly welcomed even though you don't know the host or any of the other guests- and now make sure I introduce myself first, comment in a few threads that I have an interest in and so on, and only then- i.e. when folks have got to know me a bit- do I start talking about my game.<br/>2.\tGet people interested in your game by involving them in the design process, asking for help and advice with the mechanics, artwork and game world etc.- again, something I failed to do at first. This does two things: it gives people that all-important buy-in, and it helps you along the way because even if the people reading your posts aren\u2019t interested in the type of game you\u2019re offering, they will generally have useful ideas about how to achieve various design objectives.<br/>3.\tRemember that not all, perhaps hardly any, of your market will necessarily be active forum users so schlepping round cons is a must- you\u2019ll get all the benefits of the above, plus people will actually be playing your game; if they like it they\u2019ll tell all their friends about it and this means there\u2019s a solid foundation for when you eventually publish.<br/>4.\tMake a youtube video, or better still try to persuade existing podcasts to do this for you by recording a play- I know you said you\u2019ve done this already but it\u2019s really a question of numbers- the more the better.<br/>5.\tHave a polished and professional-looking website. You don\u2019t have to shell out vast sums of \xa3/$ for this nowadays, but don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that if you just knock something together it\u2019ll be ok. One of the reasons I haven\u2019t got my own website up and running yet is that I want to work on the content and appearance until I\u2019m happy that it looks reasonably appealing. A lot of designers nowadays make do with a blog (I\u2019m currently in the process of setting one up myself), which I would say is a convenient short-term fix but you still need to think about a website long-term, with buy now buttons linking to payment sites most people trust, clear information about your game and all the prices (you\u2019ll ideally need to make both print and e-pub versions available), and a well-presented reviews and comments section. And links to websites like this one.<br/>6.\tBe patient. Don\u2019t panic if you don\u2019t get many hits at first- give it time, bearing in mind that folks won\u2019t necessarily make a purchasing decision immediately they hear about a game; moreover the decision won\u2019t be made on seeing your site alone.<br/><br/>Hope that helps. As I said above, none of it implies criticism of your approach so far, and a good deal of it is based on my own learning curve. Finally, remember that even the big names of today had to start somewhere, and every designer has been in the position you\u2019re in now.<br/><br/>Good luck dude!

I am very unlikely to find time to run a game that I'm only vaguely interested in, but I will sit down to play a new game of almost anything, just for a novel experience and to learn more about people and their designs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393962/#Comment_393962" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T13:58:18+00:00" title="October 19, 2012  1:58PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dropkick a dingo on main street.

If someone calls you out (for saying something racist, for being a jerk, for design flaws, w/e), your response will have an effect. If you argue or dismiss, then in the future I will remember that and it'll be a point of dissuasion from investing in your stuff. If you respond constructively and demonstrate that you're listening, it'll be a point of persuasion toward investing in your stuff.<br/><br/>If you be silly and creative in the [Make Stuff!] threads, and you are thoughtful and engaged in [Story Games] and [Play Advice] threads, and you respond to criticism respectfully (at least most of the time), and you challenge yourself to be a bastion of thoughtfulness, and you don't shill your stuff at every corner... it'll both make you friends and build a supportive audience for your design work.<br/><br/>By being a good person, you become a bankable name, and that's a factor in how you sell stuff in small communities/markets.<br/><br/>That's a slightly uncomfortable thing to say, because it can be paraphrased as "people buy your stuff based on you, not on your stuff." But it's true to some degree. For example: I've had the good fortune of having my games widely promoted/shared in social networks, and most of those shares have included sentences highlighting my personal character. Now, I've comported myself poorly online before, and still do so today in some instances. But I try to follow the advice I am giving in this post, and people notice that, and that's an influencing factor in their choice to buy &amp; support my games.

I actually checked out <b>Ingenero</b> a while back and found it really interesting. <b>I'll tell you why I didn't end up buying it</b> because it seems like you want honesty. It's something that a few other people mentioned: <b>the fact that it's a generic system</b>. I think most people already have a go-to generic system with a lot of published support at this point. What interests <i>me</i> are games with rulesets specifically tailored for what they do, and I think this is a really common opinion in the indie gamer world.<br/><br/>If you're willing to reboot your launch (and I don't see why you wouldn't be), you could try this: take your best setting, the one that you love above the others and fits the tightest with the rules set (there's gotta be a favorite, right?), and tweak Ingenero to wrap around it and it alone. Call it an Ingenero game, that's the name of your system, but make <i>this</i> game a unique vision of the system that really nails the setting, even if it means that it doesn't quite fit another scenario/setting that you've got. <br/><br/>Think about how many games do this! So many games. If you've got a system wrapped tightly around a premise I am way more likely to buy it, <i>regardless of what that premise is</i>. The games that have excited me the most over the past few months are probably Durance, Our Last Best Hope, and Dungeon World (itself a hack of another system). These games have <i>nothing</i> in common with one another, except that <i>they emulate their genre really well</i>. I can think of a million-and-one ways to hack them apart and make them do other genres or playsets, and that's part of the fun. That's what sells me, at least!<br/><br/>(p.s. If you do this, I gotta say that personally I think <i>Nights of the Crusades</i> looks cool; it's something I don't think I've ever seen before.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394023/#Comment_394023" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T19:29:23+00:00" title="October 19, 2012  7:29PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Scrape">@Scrape</a>   I agree.  This is why I have 5 scenarios (100 pages) included with the core rules (70 pages).    Any why Ive tagged the game as 'play like a HBO series' because that is its niche - situations featuring a tight cast of characters where the focus is as much on the interaction between the characters as it is on the events surrounding them.   The <i>Bogeymen</i> scenario is probably the strongest  in that regard.<br/><br/>So its more like a generic theme than a specific theme.

I've never watched one, I'll confess, so I don't know what exactly the game does well. Can you explain the genre in terms that a dude without HBO can understand? Maybe you gotta broaden the pitch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394034/#Comment_394034" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T22:15:11+00:00" title="October 19, 2012 10:15PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Scrape">@Scrape</a>  Ill  re-edit the website front page, cheers                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394148/#Comment_394148" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-21T03:19:12+00:00" title="October 21, 2012  3:19AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd consider signing up with project wonderful and advertising on the 'play this thing' ad square they have, for a solid week. Basically if the ads there for long enough, people who keep coming back keep seeing it, which increases their curiosity points. It just needs to be up for quite some time. I've had that happen to me - the ads been there long enough that curiosity pips me. With project wonderful you can also put up ads for free here and there by finding them with their search engine - only downside is you have to enter the ads manually.<br/><br/>I'd also suggest writing on a blog about the book every week day or such. Take a small section and give some designer perspective. The constant posts will slowly grow your blog traffic.<br/><br/>Remember Gygax did alot of wargaming prior to D&amp;D - as you say, that is alot of networking already done.<br/><br/>Other than that, my inner cynic says it's trends - some of the people who sell alot of books, if no one knew about them then they would sell alot less or none.<br/><br/>Anyway, alot of people might say you shouldn't do this or you shouldn't do that in advertising, but in the end they don't do anything towards helping you so don't listen to them too much (the only reason to listen a little is in case they actually get actively obstructive in your pursuit of selling the product - which makes them pretty nasty).<br/><br/>Everyone seems to have rules for good behaviour, but they don't seem to have rules for how rice gets to your dinner plate.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394180/#Comment_394180" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-21T09:24:46+00:00" title="October 21, 2012  9:24AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Anyway, alot of people might say you shouldn't do this or you shouldn't do that in advertising, but in the end they don't do anything towards helping you so don't listen to them too much (the only reason to listen a little is in case they actually get actively obstructive in your pursuit of selling the product - which makes them pretty nasty).<br/><br/>Everyone seems to have rules for good behaviour, but they don't seem to have rules for how rice gets to your dinner plate.<br/></blockquote>\n+1<br/><br/>Oh, and I had an awesome conversation with Kyle Simons last night for the podcast, and one potentially valuable recommendation came out of it is to try reaching out, personally, to other, more established designers whose work you admire.

Sometimes people who seem to be ignoring you are actually just too busy to respond to threads on Story Games or RPG.net, and might be very willing to offer help on a one-on-one basis once you approach them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394182/#Comment_394182" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-21T09:55:05+00:00" title="October 21, 2012  9:55AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You need to run this game in person and online.

I'll never be able to see the future through your eyes this quickly, and worse, if you've told me what I need to know to be able to easily say no, I'll say no.<br/><br/>The best elevator pitch doesn't pitch your project. It pitches the meeting about your project. The best elevator pitch is true, stunning, brief and it leaves the listener eager (no, desperate) to hear the rest of it. ... "I quit my job as an Emmy-winning actress to do this because..." or "Our company is profitable and has grown 10% per week, every week, since July," or "The King of Spain called me last week about the new project we just launched."<br/><br/>More conversations and fewer announcements."</i></blockquote>\n<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2012/10/the-acute-heptagram-of-impact.html" rel="nofollow">The Acute Heptagram of Impact</a>:\n<blockquote><i>"Your project's success is going to be influenced in large measure by the reputation of the people who join in and the organization that brings it forward. That's nothing you can completely change in a day, but it's something that will change (like it or not) every day.<br/><br/>None of this matters if you and your team don't persist, and your persistence will largely be driven by the desire you have to succeed, which of course is relentlessly undermined by the fear we all wrestle with every day.<br/><br/>These seven elements: Strategy, Tactics, Execution, Reputation, Persistence, Desire and Fear, make up the seven points of the acute heptagram of impact. If your project isn't working, it's almost certainly because one or more of these elements aren't right. And in my experience, it's all of them.

I my case, usually it translates to a sale when I'm persuaded that your game is going to fit into my short-term play schedule, which is of course a hugely subjective measure; sometimes I'm not able to know that from promotional materials (in which case, no sale), which also implies <i>I'm much more likely to buy a game I've already been able to play or read before buying it</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zydake" title="zydake"><img alt="zydake" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nAK5WMQP5MDFD.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zydake">zydake</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395236/#Comment_395236" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T07:13:36+00:00" title="October 29, 2012  7:13AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread has been a huge eye-opener for me.

Like, if I make 3 ambit (but interesting and attention-grabbing claims), are you suggesting that I <b>dont</b> try to back these up, but rather just leave it hanging as an enticement for people to buy the game and see for themselves?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395340/#Comment_395340" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T22:23:33+00:00" title="October 29, 2012 10:23PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I look at what Seth suggested:\n<blockquote><i>"I quit my job as an Emmy-winning actress to do this because..." or "Our company is profitable and has grown 10% per week, every week, since July," or "The King of Spain called me last week about the new project we just launched."</i></blockquote>\n... I see things that establish credibility (Emmy-winning actress launches webseries; the King of Spain is on board), intrigue me (the King of Spain called you) or establish successes. Things that get me to read more and find out why what this person is claiming is true.<br/><br/>(For a reader, that's probably the equivalent of starting a conversation.)<br/><br/>Your blurb on the Ingenero site's front page is short and easily to digest, and made me want to click on some links to find out how it creates emotionally charged drama.<br/><br/>So, the front page was you starting the conversation. Me getting intrigued and clicking on the link was how I responded. Maybe <b>whatever link I click on next should have the material I need to answer my question</b>s ... and maybe suggest some ways the conversation could go next (but not much else). Using the conversation analogy, that means you're not monologuing at me - you're giving me a chance to engage.<br/><br/>It's the thing I click on next, that's where you back up your claims.<br/><br/>At a higher level, though, the conversation really refers to the ongoing process of doing everything everyone's mentioned above: form connections, find your audience, actually play it, etc, etc.<br/><br/>Also: to promote another couple of Seth Godin posts that have always seemed relevant to me:<br/><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/07/advise_for_auth.html" rel="nofollow">Advice for Authors (2005)</a><br/><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/08/advice_for_auth.html" rel="nofollow">Advice for Authors (2006)</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
