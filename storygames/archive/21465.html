Trying to make it more fey and alien than the bog-standard D&amp;D versions. What I want to include:<br/><br/>\u2014chiseled from stone (they are actually made from stone, wear no armor, and will crumble to dust when killed violently or petrified if death is natural)<br/>\u2014pupiless eyes glow a fiery amber (will turn ghostly white as they near death)<br/>\u2014vulnerable to cold iron (these are considered fairies)<br/>\u2014fear of strong water and wind (wears down mountains\u2014penalty of -3 while water-bound or airborne on all rolls)<br/>\u2014one with stone (excellent stonemasons and miners\u2014dwarf abilities of sloping passages and so on).<br/>\u2014light sensitivity (excellent underground/dark vision, but very poor in bright light. They wear a type of welder\u2019s goggles which also prevents humankind from freaking out at their unnatural looking eyes)<br/>\u2014pick and hammer (these are preferred and can be used as ranged weapons)<br/>\u2014under stone (They gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage bonus if it is underground in natural rock against most opponents. Their extensive knowledge of stone grants it a +2 on attack and damage rolls against creatures made of stone or earth (such as earth elementals, stone golems, and so on).<br/>\u2014immunity (paralysis, petrification, and poison)<br/>\u2014eldritch resistance. (+2 saving throw vs spells)<br/>\u2014second class citizens (most humans see them little better than vermin)<br/><br/>So these are some of my initial thoughts. More in line with Derro, Duegar, Pech, or Knockers than typical dwarves (though not evil nor insane). Not sure about a lust for gold or gems\u2014but I need reasons for them to become adventurers.<br/><br/>I need to refined and condense, but this is the start. <br/><br/>How about some suggestions for this class.

A male dwarf (maybe towards the end of their life?) will carve a son or daughter from living rock, with embellishments and adornments of precious metals and gems provided by a female dwarf. With enough attention and craftsmanship, an ancient magic takes hold of the carving and imbues it with the spark of life, becoming a new dwarf.<br/><br/>They love the food and drink of surface dwellers--since it so different from what they eat down below. Their spartan sustenance comes from animal, fungi, and plant found underground. They can go long periods without eating (or drinking).<br/><br/>They can't be harvested, though a stone could be killed before gaining life.<br/><br/>I would say they made from marble (or a type of similar stone). Perhaps a type of Calcite, thus tying in their fear of raging water.<br/><br/>I think falling damage would be similar.<br/><br/>Perhaps at birth they are polished, but lose luster as they age.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469791/#Comment_469791" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-08T03:34:43+00:00" title="February  8, 2018  3:34AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> has dwarves carved out of stone!

Seems like an interesting thing for self-replicating golems to feature - mythically appropriate if one interprets the Life principle to be inherently sexual (as is traditional in historical mythologies). So even if dwarves don't have biological sexes, they'd still feature what amounts to sexual selection and a resemblance to the divine ideals of gender, just like humans and halflings and whatnot do.<br/><br/>So maybe you need two dwarves to cooperate in procreation, and maybe they have to take distinctive roles (as described), and maybe individual dwarves tend to have clear preferences on what their role would be. Some might be more flexible, willing to fulfill either role. Maybe an elder dwarf is more likely to be interested in the ornamental role, while a younger one views itself as a natural sculpturist, or vice versa. All this could be true as pure socio-psychology, without the dwarves themselves being physically gendered in any way. Or there could be physical signs, but they might be grown and shed depending on how the dwarf feels - as they're not humans, there's no need for their genders to work like anything on earth.<br/><br/>Thinking of how their reproduction might influence their society, one would perhaps expect the dwarves to see the ornamental gender as naturally more sophisticated, nuanced and cultural, while the sculptural gender is perhaps expected to be stronger, practical and more vivacious. Something of that sort might emerge as extensions of these reproduction roles. If the dwarves end up gendering their society outside of the bedchamber (or is that the rock quarry), perhaps their artists and scholars are mainly ornamentalists, while soldiers and manual labor are mainly sculpturists.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469824/#Comment_469824" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-08T19:09:38+00:00" title="February  8, 2018  7:09PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Social gender is good.

They are a diminutive and reclusive folk who live in the cracks and crevices of mines. Stones are rarely seen, but often heard working with hammers and pickaxes. They are mischievous fey who dump over the miners lunch pails, blow out their candles and lamps, and hide their picks and shovels. Some are even more malicious, leading miners astray to fall to their deaths or become hopelessly lost in the darkness. They have a lust for gold and precious gems.<br/><br/>Reality: Standing about four-feet tall, Stones have large, pupiless eyes which glow in fiery hues and are adept in low-light conditions. Most have wrinkled, kindly faces with long flowing white beards. Stones prefer simple, colorful clothing and wear no armor other than a miner\u2019s apron. When young, they have a hard, stone-like appearance which supports the belief that they are carved from living rock rather than born. As Stones age, their skin becomes finer and more polished\u2014resembling marble.<br/><br/>Base XP: 2,200<br/>Max Level: 12<br/>HD: 1d4+1<br/>Attack: As thief<br/>Saves: As dwarf<br/>Prime: Con, Dex<br/>Min Scores: Con 9, Dex 9<br/>Max Score: Cha 12<br/>XP bonus: +5% XP if Con 13+, +10% XP if Con 16+<br/>Armor: Leather Apron over cloth 7 (AC -3 for natural armor)<br/>Weapons: Hammer (1d6), pickaxe (1d4/1d6 two-handed), or sling stone (1d4)<br/><br/>Restrictions:  Stones use four-sided dice plus one (d4+1) to determine their Hit Points. They may advance to a maximum of 12th level of experience. Stones will most often use a hammer, pickaxe, or a sling for weapons. Stones must have a minimum score of 9 in both Constitution and Dexterity. Their maximum score in Charisma is 12. Cold iron is poison to Stones. The effect isn\u2019t instant, except in combat when\u2014if hit\u2014cold iron weapons cause +1 additional damage. But extended contact, or if ingested, with cold iron will slowly and permanently drain a Stone\u2019s Hit Points and Ability Scores (and eventually death). In any case, Stones will never have any weapons, tools, or items made from cold iron; they use instead various stones, woods, or non-ferrous metals and alloys (brass, bronze, silver, gold, mithril, etc.). Stones have spellcasting abilities (no spellbook required) which are Tommyknocker and Coldfire.<br/><br/>Special: Stones are supernaturally gifted miners, using a heavy pickaxe they tunnel through 1' of solid rock or 5' of earth per turn. The resulting tunnel is 3' wide and 3' tall. The work is loud and tiring, requiring two wandering monster checks each turn. A Stone can excavate a number of turns equal to his Constitution score each day and will need a good nights sleep before working again. In some dungeons the very earth is infused with evil and working it is slower, if the dungeon level is higher than the experience level of the Stone the pace is slowed by the same proportion (a 2nd level Stone tunneling in the 3rd dungeon layer would excavate 2/3 of a foot per turn). They are able to find slanting passages, traps, shifting walls, and new construction one-third of the time (a roll of 1 or 2 on 1d6) when looking for them. Stones have better Saving Throws than most other character classes (except against water or wind attacks). They have a natural Armor Class of 4 and due to their small size and stone skin, Stones have a bonus Armor Class of -2 when being attacked by creatures larger than man-sized. They gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage bonus while underground in natural rock against most opponents. Their extensive knowledge of stone grants them a +2 on attack and damage rolls against creatures made of stone or earth (such as earth elementals, stone golems, caryatid columns, et al.). They are immune to paralysis, petrification, and poison. Stones have a fear of raging water and gusting wind (-4 to all rolls). They have light sensitivity (excellent vision  while underground or in darkness, but very poor in bright light. They will often wear a type of welder\u2019s goggles to aid them\u2014but suffer -2 to all roles in sunlight. When underground, in natural environments, Stones are difficult to spot\u2014having the ability to seemingly become one with the rock. Stone have only a 10% chance of being detected in this environment and they also gain surprise on a roll of 1-3 on 1d6. At will, when underground, Stones can cast Coldfire, this spell creates a dancing blue flame which can be used as a dim light source or to confuse opponents. Monsters must make a saving throw vs. Spells every round the spell lasts or the spell will affect them that round. Once per day (increasing once for each level), while underground,  a Stone can cast Tommyknocker\u2014this spell creates a knocking or hammering sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. Any monsters who hears the sound must make a saving throw vs. Spells to disbelieve. All Stones have Second Sight, which enables them to see another fairy\u2019s true form, even if the fairy is Invisible to Mortals, polymorphed, or shapechanged.
