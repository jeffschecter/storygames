But I <i>do</i> want to get some gaming in, and there seems only one way to do: run something myself at the local game store on their open-roleplaying night.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that I have a wealth of indie games to choose from, what I really want to run (and play) is <i>Dark Heresy</i>, a game set in the <i>Warhammer 40,000</i> universe in which characters assume a part in the Holy Orders of the Emperor's Inquisition.  It's the first of three 40K roleplaying games and a good place to get started with the setting, thanks to all the supplemental material and whatnot.<br/><br/>Anyway, <i>Dark Heresy</i> is clearly set up with a classic gaming group in mind: a GM, plus 3-4 players.  Realistically I'm not going to see that kind of turnout from whatever ad I might place seeking others.  Chances are good it'll just be me and one other person and things are mighty dangerous in the 40K setting for a man or woman alone.<br/><br/>So I guess the question is this, directed to those who know <i>Dark Heresy</i>: is the game viable with a single player or will I have to surround the PC with a complement of NPCs just to keep the mortality rate down?<br/><br/>One solution would seem to be to start the solo character with more baseline experience to make up for the missing party members.  This is the first thing that occurred to me, as it's what I would do if I were running, say, <i>D&amp;D</i>.  I think part of the fun of <i>Dark Heresy</i>, though, is coming up from the ranks of the lowly and you lose some of that by powering up the player early.<br/><br/>On the other hand, you have the NPC-party option, which has its own drawbacks.  For one thing, it adds a lot of bookkeeping for me on top of what I would normally do as a GM, but you also run the risk of eclipsing the player's accomplishments if the NPCs perform <i>too</i> well.<br/><br/>Anyway, both solutions have their drawbacks.  And with luck they'll only have to be employed for a little while as the group grows.  Which seems like the better choice to you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283907/#Comment_283907" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-01T09:52:17+00:00" title="August  1, 2010  9:52AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hrm, I don't like either solution ('specially not the NPC party one), but then I've never played <i>Dark Heresy</i>. Can't you just tweak monster/enemy stats to make a better challenge for one player? If you have one player, then you have one character (or do you?) so start with an in-fiction reason why this inquisitor is doing his thing alone. It seems like challenges for one character would logically flow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283908/#Comment_283908" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-01T09:52:35+00:00" title="August  1, 2010  9:52AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, to me, the whole appeal of Dark Heresy is in investigation and mysteries and what not. If I want balls-to-the-wall fights in the 40k Universe, I'll play 40k (or more likely, an extensively hacked Necromunda <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ). So, I'd just take it pretty easy on the combat encounters for a small/one person party. And don't the baddies have a genericized 'threat level' given? I don't have any experience with how that maps to actual play, but it might help. I got a bunch of Dark Heresy books this last year, and my reaction to them has been that I can't wait to run a game . . . with a completely different system. As you say, the setting material is all great, and really hits the cool points of the 40k world to my mind, but your mention of 'book keeping headaches' puts me in mind of how the whole game seems like it would be.<br/><br/>That being said, good luck getting your game going!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283935/#Comment_283935" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-01T16:40:59+00:00" title="August  1, 2010  4:40PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, okay, in the WH40K universe, an assemblage as fascinating to me as a 12-car pileup with multiple fatalities, there are two things that pose a challenge to single character stories:<br/><br/>* Hordes. Not just the Orks, but even hordes of humans (Imperial Guard), and alien monstars, and so on.  One of the thematic elements of this universe is a small group being <i>ridiculously</i> outnumbered.  The scale is intentionally overwhelming - in Rogue Trader, you're the command crew of a ship holding 20-40,000 people.  With one character, no matter how powerful, you're really not going to have that horde-like experience.<br/><br/>* Darkness everywhere. As the hilarious epitome of grimdark settings, WH40K emphasizes that the good guys are basically Nazi theocrats and the bad guys would prefer to unmake the entire universe. This necessitates a wide variety of skills in your WH40K adventuring party, because you're just as likely to find Chaos cultists operating in high society as xeno sympathizers in the dregs. While Dark Heresy characters are not SUPER specialized (this is one thing I like about the system), they are normally specialized enough that in a one player game you're going to have massive gaping blind spots where, settingwise, monstrous pools of pure evil will seep in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
