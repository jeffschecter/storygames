I don't know).  Now it's 100 years later, and the planetoid has has traveled about 20 light years, and is arriving at Gliese 581b.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou've got 24 of the most densely populated cities of earth at each vertex (Lagos, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Mumbai, Egypt, etc).  And now you are coming to one of the closest planets to earth in the "Habitable Zone".  What do you do?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I could go on and on, but is there a good hackable system out there that folks can recommend?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nChris                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349871/#Comment_349871" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-28T16:35:13+00:00" title="November 28, 2011  4:35PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might want to take a look at Diaspora, which is explicitly about space-opera.<br/><br/>For something that's both hackable and geared towards a more traditional, White-Wolf style campaign, Apocalypse World has lots of neat bits.<br/><br/>For an even more traditional game, you could to GURPS Transhuman Space!<br/><br/>What is your game about?

Diaspora's focus is, I think, much tighter than simply to say "space-opera". For example: I don't think Diaspora would be an appropriate choice to make for a game like Star Wars, Star Trek, Banks' Culture, Smith's Lensman, and the like. There are aspects to traditional Space Opera that Diaspora flies directly in the face of: transcendant technology, wide proliferation of intelligent life, a panoply of worlds and attendant cultures.<br/><br/>From wikipedia: "Perhaps the most significant trait of space opera is that settings, characters, battles, powers, and themes tend to be very large-scale."<br/><br/>Diaspora's focus seems to me to be a lot more like Traveller: an emphasis on "realism", human-scale activities and conflicts.<br/><br/>If you wanted to stick with a FATE based game, then <i>Starblazer Adventures</i>, warts and all, is probably a better fit for traditional space opera gaming. I think <i>Strands of Fate</i> might also stretch to it.<br/><br/>But I agree with you and Wilhelm in general -- "if you want a story focused system, you'll have to tell us what the PCs are supposed to do".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349908/#Comment_349908" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-29T07:09:43+00:00" title="November 29, 2011  7:09AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds a bit like James Blish's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cities_in_Flight" rel="nofollow">Cities in Flight</a>.

It begins as a sort of Cyberpunk type setting - it's gritty and urban, with some high-tech mixing with some very low tech. And then all of a sudden, everyone's world will begin to change as it becomes clear that this planetoid actually had a destination, but no one knows why the planetoid has been brought to this planet.  It's a time of great opportunity, as well as confusion and chaos.  A time when the low can remake themselves anew, The high may be brought low, and the morally ambiguous can pursue their obsessions with less oversight.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the setting is therefore rich in many different types of adventures, so maybe a more generic system like GURPS is the best to use.  I could see some sort of revolution campaign; or a military campaign between different cities; or an investigative campaign - trying to figure out what is going on; or a scientific campaign; or a more high-level campaign among the various leaders of the cities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all for the various suggestions, I'll check them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349974/#Comment_349974" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-29T16:25:29+00:00" title="November 29, 2011  4:25PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            actually it sounds like a great job for In a Wicked Age.
