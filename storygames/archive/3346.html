I FIGHT!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, like, last night I almost-ran a playtest of <i>Misery Bubblegum</i> and I described to people that they would make up one word to describe their character's role.  I gave examples like "Princess," "Scrapper," "Jock" and the like, but made sure that they understood that they could do <i>anything</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd people <i>totally froze</i>.  Like, I could make popsicles in the sudden lack of heat and energy at that table.  So we played <i>Ticket to Ride</i> instead, and had a great time.  But I was set to thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that I have gone a long way toward gearing the game to benefit from the strengths of a class-based system ... but not far enough.  I suspect that I can benefit from making up classes, like "Princess," "Scrapper," and "Jock" (and "Slacker," "Bookworm," "Rebel," etc., etc.) ... and making those the <b>only</b> choices that you're allowed.  Maybe I could even make a set of behaviors that are archetypally appropriate for those characters, to prompt people when they're feeling blank-page syndrome ("A Princess may draw a card any time she demands or receives special treatment").<br/>\n<br/>\nHey, it works for <i>D&amp;D;</i>, I figure that's about as good a test case as anything can be.

The WW model of having 3 covarying options of five choices each (which I have totally ripped off) allows everyone to play Princesses if they want to.

And people<em>totally froze</em>.</blockquote>\nI was there. I can't speak for anyone else, obviously, but there were three layers of reasons why I froze: my inability to "lead with my id" as usual in the presence of your (charming) six-year-old, my lack of enthusiasm for the Harry Potter setting that you proposed (in part to make the game six-year-old-safe), and only thirdly the system issues.<br/><br/>And the system issue was not what I think you think it was. In most earlier playtests of <i>Misery Bubblegum</i>, characters weren't defined by "one role, anything you want" but by "three adjectives, anything you want" (often with some kind of ritual back-and-forth of contrasting traits among players to help elaborate). I found "any three" much easier than "any one." Two reasons, one relatively obvious and probably universal, one subtler and perhaps more peculiar to my personal playstyle:<br/><br/>1) "Choose one word that is all the self-definition your character is going to get" puts an immense burden on selecting the <i>right</i> word -- and often there isn't one right word for the concept you have in your head. Being able to define a character as "the intersection of these three traits" is a lot easier than as "the embodiment of this one trait." Most White Wolf-style "splats" are combinations of characteristics, not a single role; and even D&amp;D relies on race-class-alignment, not just class in isolation, for most of its editions.<br/><br/>I can't even figure out how to define characters from my favorite fiction with one word: Princess Leia isn't <i>just</i> the "princess" in the group, she's the "feisty princess"; Han Solo isn't just the "scoundrel," he's the "charming scoundrel"; Darth Vader isn't just evil and he isn't just a warrior, he's a "dark knight."<br/><br/>2) The most concise way to depict a story or a character vividly is a high concept: "It's Jaws - in space!" "He's Harry Potter -- crossed with Tony Jr. from <i>The Sopranos</i>!" "He's your archenemy -- and your father!" The power of a high concept is <i>not</i> that it uses a single, iconic role: The power of the high concept is the <i>tension</i> between two linked concepts, and the more radically <i>at odds</i> the two concepts are at odds, the more story-energy is contained in that tension, waiting to be released.<br/><br/>If you'll go back to my <i>Star Wars</i> examples for a moment, you'll see that all three are high concepts: the hauteur and reserve implicit in "princess" is at odds with the hands-on combativeness of "feisty"; "charming" attracts, "scoundrel" repels; "dark knight" implies a combination of terrible evil and chivalric dignity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka" title="GMSkarka"><img alt="GMSkarka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v385/GMSkarka/tinyadamant.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka">GMSkarka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75639/#Comment_75639" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T10:13:44+00:00" title="June 14, 2007 10:13AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The whole archetype-membership-ownership thing is why I'm going to be providing Sects in FAR WEST (well, that, and they're a big part of Wuxia stories).<br/><br/>Players like the imagination-stimulation of archetypes, and also tend to get a sense of belonging (membership, and to an extent, ownership) when distinct groups are provided (it's a mammal-socialization thing, we can't help it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75651/#Comment_75651" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T10:48:45+00:00" title="June 14, 2007 10:48AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I second the call for limiting player choices during set-up.

In practice, skill points are too valuable to "waste" on cross-class skills and feats are too wrapped up in vital class functions (if you're a melee fighter you <i>need</i> to take Power Attack and Cleave, etc.) to be of much use in branching out and customizing. <br/><br/>So if your character concept is more than slightly outside WotC's vision of what fantasy archetypes should be, you're either stuck playing a sub-optimal character or you wait for them to put out a supplement with a new character class that better fits the kind of character you want to play. And they're more than happy to oblige -- last time I looked, there were more than <i>fifty</i> "base classes" spread out among the various supplements. <br/><br/>It seems to me that all those classes serve to substantially detract the focus on strong fantasy archetypes which were -- for me anyway -- part of D&amp;D's original appeal.<br/><br/>So I guess what I'm saying is archetypes are good, but D&amp;D-style classes may not be the best way to support them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75673/#Comment_75673" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T11:47:00+00:00" title="June 14, 2007 11:47AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sydney Freedberg</cite>"Choose one word that is all the <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>self</i></span></b>-definition your character is going to get" puts an immense burden on selecting the right word</blockquote>Emphasis very much mine.  Sydney knows the system well enough that he pointed out as a sideline to his main point the point I was going to make.<br/><br/>A session of play in <i>Misery Bubblegum</i> is a journey of change from the person the character <i>begins</i> as into the person that they let other people remake them into.  They choose whose opinions they are going to make a part of who they are.  So while Heather, Heather, Heather and Veronica may all <i>start out</i> as identical Princesses, the course of play refines and changes them until they are the Bitch Princess (deceased), the Opportunist Princess, the Flunky Princess and the Sheriff.<br/><br/>So I'm not sure how much it's important to worry about niche protection.  Is it possible for the same starting point to force players into the same <i>journey</i>?  I suppose it's possible, but it doesn't strike me as tremendously likely.  What seems more likely is that the closer they are to begin with, the more radically they will diverge from each other.<br/><br/>Also, I get what Sydney's saying about the distinction between "Princess" and "Feisty Princess" ... I suppose what I'm proposing is that adding that adjective is, for this game, destructive pre-play.  If you get to do "Feisty" in char-gen then you rob the other players of the right to importantly say "Wow ... she's feisty!" in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75677/#Comment_75677" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T11:49:40+00:00" title="June 14, 2007 11:49AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>Trouble is, it doesn't really<i>work</i>all that well for D&amp;D.</blockquote>Sure it does.

Classes generally "end" at 10th level. <br/><br/>Did you play "Final Fantasy X"?<br/>Tidus would be a "Fighter 1, Hunter 1, White Mage 1"<br/>Yuna: White Mage 2, Elementaler 1<br/>Wakka: Fighter 1, Vagabond 1, Elementaler 1<br/>Lulu: Black Mage 3<br/>Rikku: Vagabond 2, Jarhead 1<br/>Auron: Samurai 2, Fighter 1<br/><br/>Or, if you were to stat other characters out in this system:<br/>Elric: Fighter 3, Black Mage 5, Elementaler 2<br/>Conan: Figher 5, Vagabond 3<br/><br/>When you choose each class, and look at the level, it tells you:<br/>1) What your attributes are (If you were a Mage 2 Elementaler 1, it would be: Mage (x2) might be "Str 3 Dex 3 Con 2 Int 5 Wis 4 Cha 4", and Elementaler (x1) might be "Str 2 Dex 4 Con 2 Int 4 Wis 3 Cha 5"; so your starting attributes will be Str 8 Dex 10 Con 6 Int 14 Wis 11 Cha 13" <br/>2) What your special abilities are (a "Samurai 1" will have 2 set "charms" that all samurai 1 have, Samurai 2 has those two plus one more, Samurai 3 has all the above plus 1-2 more, etc: stuff like improved initiative, 2-weapon fighting, fast draw, etc)<br/>3) What your starting equipment is (a "Warrior 2" will have a healing potion, while a "Warrior 3" will have a healing potion and protection amulet)<br/><br/>I pretty much fell in love with the above, once I realized that, aside from jotting down the various "crap" (attrs, charms, gear) that results from combining the classes, Character Generation literally takes a few seconds: "I'll be a Fighter/White Mage/Vagabond!" "I'll be a Level 2 Samurai, Level 1 Elementaler!"... and That's It. That defines your attributes, skills, charms, equipment, eveything. And the next person over will most likely choose another combo and come up with a completely different character.  Even a "Samurai 2/Elementaler 1" "Samurai 2/Vagabond 1" will look on paper quite different.<br/><br/>That realization has been like an atom bomb in my head in terms of gaming theory/craft. In fact, on the side I'm puttering around with a way to make a level/class based version of TSOY that does the above, adding a little wiggle room for personalized secrets/keys.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75724/#Comment_75724" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T13:59:03+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  1:59PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, that's really cool.

One of the traditional problems with systems that let you distribute points among character abilities (and all this is is a very coarse system of such) has been the jack of all trades, master of none, the character that looks like they can do all sorts of things, but in fact can't do any.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's essentially the issue Ron raised with going outside WotC's class visions. Try to diversify that fighter, and the character ends up not being all that good at the other stuff, plus has compromised his fighting ability.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe advantage of the three original core D&amp;D; classes was that they were all effective. After that, I think the classes were a mixed bag. With AD&amp;D; (1e), Rangers, Paladins, and Druids were all pretty effective. The Thief's effectiveness depended on the GM. The Monk and Illusionist were questionable. And the Bard was just weird. D&amp;D; 3e has at least made the Rogue is a little more reliably effective since the applicability of sneak attack is based on objective rules (though the GM can still stack the deck against the Rogue with undead and constructs).<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75735/#Comment_75735" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T14:25:15+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  2:25PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not really.

Unfortunately, under standard D&amp;D rules, if I pick Fighter as my class, my Fighter will absolutely suck compared to yours.

I'd call the adjective list something like Styles and the roles, well, Roles. A Style + a Role gives you a "class", so you could have things like Tough Fighter (your fighter in my example above), Sneaky Fighter (my fighter in the example above), Devout Fighter (your basic paladin), etc.<br/><br/>You'd get some abilities from your Style (Tough characters get Power Attack, Sneaky ones get Sneak Attack, or whatever) and some from your Role (Fighters get Weapon Specialization, Wizards get familiars, etc.) and maybe certain combinations would get abilities of their own (Devout Fighters get Smite Evil). <br/><br/>Tack a player-generated aspect onto the end (Tough Fighter With A Heart of Gold, Devout Thief With A Shameful Past), and I'd start finding classes interesting again.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75832/#Comment_75832" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-15T06:33:54+00:00" title="June 15, 2007  6:33AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, here's my very brief opinion.<br/><br/>Classes are awesome.

One of the traditional problems with systems that let you distribute points among character abilities (and all this is is a very coarse system of such) has been the jack of all trades, master of none, the character that looks like they can do all sorts of things, but in fact can't do any.</blockquote>\nNot really. The base idea is that (in Alshard) most characters will want to diversify, taking at least a 2/1 combination if not 1/1/1. The "charms" are pretty powerful even at first level, and characters that take all their three starting levels in one class look really lopsided, and have poor success. A Fighter 3 can kill shit slightly better, but a Fighter 2/White Mage 1 can heal himself and stay in the game, or a Figher 2/Vagabond 1 could use manuvering skills to get behind the enemy for better attacks, or a Samurai 2/Panzerritter 3/Aleph 5 could drive a tricked-out Harley Davidson with spikes all over it into a compound, Kill things with double-katanas, then use the Old Earth's "Kill Command Code" to activate old satellites and nuke a bunker.  A Fighter 10 can pretty much annihilate anything, but only if it's 2 meters in front of her.<br/><br/>I guess that's the rub: Sure, you make it so that "Level 10" abilities are more powerful than "Level 1" abilities, but you also make it so that multiclassed characters are far more versatile and stable than single-class characters.<br/><br/>Forgot another thing: Each class, whether you take one level or three levels in it, gets that classes' "Hyper Arts" (or "God Boon": Each class in Alshard corresponds to a Norse god or mythical creature): You can use it at any level. They are generally very powerful (I honestly can't remember them now without looking at the book; but stuff like "Reroll all your attack dice", "Backstab", etc).  Basically, when you choose more than one class you aren't looking at the benefits you can gain from it at "Level 5", you're looking at the immediate diversification you can get from grabbing 2, or 3 Hyper Arts by picking 2-3 classes.<br/><br/>So there's some slick balance in there.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75881/#Comment_75881" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-15T09:47:01+00:00" title="June 15, 2007  9:47AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy,<br/>\n<br/>\nCool! It sounds like part of what makes it work is that the abilities from multiple classes are synergistic, combined with an effect of giving you more overall actions. The problem with D&amp;D; 3e is that the abilities from two core classes often aren't synergistic. Being a Fighter 1/Wizard 1 isn't as effective as a Figher 2 or Wizard 2, because the Wizard's spells don't really help the fighter enough. The old style D&amp;D; multi-classing worked better because while your buddy might be a Fighter 5, you were a Fighter 4/Magic User 3 or so (probably making Fighter 4/Magic User 4 before your friend made Fighter 6). And of course you could cast spells in armor... It also hurts that in D&amp;D;, having 1 higher level spell to cast is often way way better than having 2 lower level spells to cast (though not always as Arcana Unearthed/Evolved showed, where it was often worth using a 3rd level slot to cast 2 2nd level spells).<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course it's also possible to wind up with more action opportunities (such as spell slots in D&amp;D;) than you can use in a game session, where it becomes more worthwhile having fewer action opportunities that each do more.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75892/#Comment_75892" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-15T10:13:42+00:00" title="June 15, 2007 10:13AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wrenching the conversation back round to <i>Misery Bubblegum</i> specifically (which, y'know, being unpublished an' all, is kind of hard for anyone but me, Tony, and two other people on Earth to comment on):\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite><cite>Posted By: Sydney Freedberg</cite>"Choose one word that is all the<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>self</i></span></b>-definition your character is going to get" puts an immense burden on selecting the right word</blockquote>Emphasis very much mine. Sydney knows the system well enough that he pointed out as a sideline to his main point the point I was going to make.<br><br>A session of play in<i>Misery Bubblegum</i>is a journey of change from the person the character<i>begins</i>as into the person that they let other people remake them into. They choose whose opinions they are going to make a part of who they are. So while Heather, Heather, Heather and Veronica may all<i>start out</i>as identical Princesses, the course of play refines and changes them until they are the Bitch Princess (deceased), the Opportunist Princess, the Flunky Princess and the Sheriff.... I get what Sydney's saying about the distinction between "Princess" and "Feisty Princess" ... I suppose what I'm proposing is that adding that adjective is, for this game, destructive pre-play. If you get to do "Feisty" in char-gen then you rob the other players of the right to importantly say "Wow ... she's feisty!" in play.<br><br>Here's the thing: Heather, Heather, Heather, Veronica, and for that matter Leia Organa and Arwen may all start out the story in the role of "princess" and develop as characters as they interact with others. But that "princess" is how <i>others</i> perceive them.<br><br>Which is fine for <i>Misery Bubblegum</i> in general, but problematic for the <i>one thing</i> the player of that character gets to choose. And it's even more problematic because, as the rules currently stand, the player has to keep acting out and narrating in that <i>one thing</i> to maximize the chance of winning conflicts. (Since the only other kind of asset you have to win conflicts with, namely other people's opinions of you, are fundamentally outside your control and even outside your knowledge, since those cards are played on your character sheet face-down). In other words, your incentive system encourages the <i>player</i> to keep emphasizing this shallow, externally defined role.<br/><br/>Let me propose a solution -- not in the expectation that you'll adopt it but in the hopes that you'll rip it apart and salvage something useful from the smoking remains:<br/><br/>1. All the players get together and toss out vague ideas for setting, situation, and character until consensus jells. (The GM's job is to STOP this process before it gets into specifics that make for "destructive pre-play.")<br/><br/>2. Each player, in turn, gives a one-sentence high-concept description of his or her character.<br/><br/>3. For each player's character, all the <i>other</i> players decide that character's ROLE. This should be quick: Someone says, "Oh, your character is totally a Princess," and everyone else says "yeah"; or at most, "no, she's the Bookworm," and everyone votes, show of hands, it's over.<br/><br/>4. Once the group has assigned everyone a role, each player individually and without having to consult with anyone about it comes up with his or her character's DRIVE -- the thing that character wants, fears, needs, or is otherwise driven by. Taking the six princesses Heather, Heather, Heather, Veronica, Leia, and Arwen as examples, I'd suggest "being mean," "being popular," "being friends with whoever's most popular," "finding my self," "freeing the galaxy," and "marrying Aragorn," respectively.<br/><br/>5a. In play, you can play cards from your own deck to your Drive and then use them in conflict, but any face cards you use that way bleed out of the system into the dead pile. (Just like Traits in the last version). You can rewrite your Drive if you make that the stakes of a conflict and win.<br/><br/>5b. In play, your Role -- which other people chose for you -- is played <i>as somebody else's Opinion of you</i>; in other words, it's a way for each character to start the game with one Opinion already on their sheet. This Opinion, however, doesn't attach to any one player: It's <i>Public Opinion</i> (something I know you've been wanting to reintegrate into the game), so all Roles draw from the Public Opinion deck.<br/><br/>Note that the tension between Role and Drive gives each character a "high concept" to start with.<br/><br/>Now this may seem a lot more elaborate than a single simple role chosen by each player. It may even seem like "destructive pre-play." But the biggest single thing I've learned from playtesting various broken versions of <i>apocalypse girl</i>, and which the "so cold I could make popsicles moment" on Wednesday night reinforced, is that you can't start with a single concept (a Role in <i>Misery Bubblegum</i>, a Core in <i>apocalypse girl</i>) and expect the rest to evolve naturally during play, because people freeze up with presented with a blank sheet of paper and no guidance (no "seed crystals," as it were): They need a framework, a procedure to follow, to get their creativity started, and before play starts, you need to give everyone more than one point to work with or they'll have a lot of trouble drawing lines.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75980/#Comment_75980" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-15T13:43:32+00:00" title="June 15, 2007  1:43PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sydney Freedberg</cite>In other words, your incentive system encourages the<i>player</i>to keep emphasizing this shallow, externally defined role.</blockquote>&gt;nod, nod&lt;  Yes.

The mechanics strongly encourage me to Do My Thing -- to emphasize my role by fighting a lot -- and they strongly reward me in satisfying ways: right here and now, my fighting protects the other members of the group so they can cast spells or pick locks or whatever, so I rightly feel useful; and in the longer term, the more I fight, the better I get at fighting.<br/><br/>If I'm playing a high-schooler (or emotional-maturity equivalent thereof), "I am a princess" is a problematic and limiting role. It's not a functional role like "fighter" based on doing something well; it's a social role about how I relate to other people. <i>But the whole game is about how I relate to other people</i>. If "you're a princess" is an Opinion someone else's character has about me, problematic and limiting are fine; my character can embrace those problems and limits or struggle against them, and I the player can choose to use or not to use the cards. But if "I'm a princess" is my role -- if it's the defining thing about who my character is, elevated above all other descriptions -- and if it's the only mechanical asset that's under my full control as a player, and I'll get my ass handed to me in conflicts if I don't use it over and over and over again -- then struggling against it is game-mechanical suicide.<br/><br/>Think about Veronica from <i>Heathers</i>. If "Veronica is a princess" is an Opinion, the mechanics allow her to outgrow it: She can afford not to use the cards on that particular Opinion -- and in fact there's a strategically valid reason not to (locking up someone else's cards so they can't use them, albeit at a high cost to oneself). But if "Veronica is a princess" is her <i>role</i>, if it's the <i>only</i> waystation at a crucial chokepoint in the game's economy, she can't afford to reject it; she can't afford not to play up being a "princess" both to load the trait with cards before a conflict and to use the cards in a conflict. <i>The mechanical incentives of the game make it nigh-impossible for Veronica to stop being a princess,</i> which means in story terms <i>the character can't grow out of it</i>.<br/><br/>I suppose you could argue that this presents a high-octane thematic/narrativist dilemma between playing your role and outgrowing it, but I think the way the mechanics work the struggle is stacked against growth. If characters in <i>Sorcerer</i> had no abilities of any kind and could only win conflicts through their demons, the game wouldn't present a valid choice about whether or not to use demons to get what you want: It would be "use demons or stay home." If <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> gave every character 4d4 of abilities to assign at will and then a 10d10 "Shoot people in the face" ability, there wouldn't be a valid choice between escalating to violence or not: It would be "shoot or stay home." Likewise, the way the mechanical deck is stacked in <i>Misery Bubblegum</i>, I strongly suspect it would be "stay a Princess or stay home." And that defeats the entire point of a game about growth and change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76036/#Comment_76036" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-15T20:43:14+00:00" title="June 15, 2007  8:43PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, there's <i>unique</i> and then there's <i>special</i>.

Multiclassing is NOT encouraged. Besides, can you actually be both a 'Princess' and a 'Geek', or does that constitute a new social group (class)?<br><br/>One thing class based systems do that I don't like is combine 'being and purpose' with 'doing and capability'. So multiclassing can create a character that is closer to what the player envisioned, but less capable of achieving the things the player wants in play, and visa versa.<br/><br/>Oh, and I've been working on this 'blank slate' problem myself. I've seen it happen before and DURING play, and it's a biggie. Maybe you should have players start out without ANY class at all, just the opinions of others for definition, and let them decide on one for their character after the first session.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peteramthor" title="peteramthor"><img alt="peteramthor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://trulyrural.com/cyberavatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peteramthor">peteramthor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76039/#Comment_76039" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-15T21:02:13+00:00" title="June 15, 2007  9:02PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used to be strong against class based systems for a long time.

I think it does cause a lot of freeze at the beginning of the game as players looka t the limited choices and try to choose the best out of X many crappy options. <br/><br/>Worse, classes limit you later on when you decide that your fighter is actually a wizard, or your priest is actually a thief. Or when you realize that the system does not let you play your priest or warrior the way you wat. Now I'm not saying this is an issue with MB, but it is an issue with many class based gaems, and the main reason why I don't play them anymore.<br/><br/>Tony, I think your first idea is better:\n<blockquote>I described to people that they would make up one word to describe their character's role.

That's cool. If your players are freezing over this then maybe the way to go is to give them a big list of examples and say "choose one or make up your own". Choosing a word (or two or three) that defines your character and then working from there to do whatever you want is a lot more fun (for me) then choosing from a limited number of generic paths that your character will be stuck on forever.<br/><br/>But that's just me.

But I'll try to be more specific.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I am not my character. If my character has issues because they're unique, so much the better for me the player. I want a character with issues. But, more importantly, I want issues that only I get to delve into. Just as the fighter gets to be the character who you explore combat with in terms of fighting instead of with magic, I want to have the character with which I get to explore princess relationships instead of jock relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, as I said, it may be irrational. But the point is that if I'm playing Monopoly, and you take the Top Hat, and there happen to be two Top Hats in this set, I'm not taking that second Top Hat because I want to be different from the start in whatever way I can be.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, you might argue that if the players know the rules that they'll see just how interesting the inter-relations between two of the same type of character might be. Or something else that the system promotes mechanically to incentivize this. But if I'm new to the game, and haven't played, or if the incentives are slight or don't outweigh the benefits of having a unique character, I'm going to try to make a unique protagonist amongst the bunch. I'm looking at the character and thinking, "This is the framwork that I have from which I'm going to be creating themes and such in play... well I don't want to trod on anybody else's themes, nor be worried about them treading on mine." So I'll do the one thing I can to ensure that they're different.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if it happens that the mechanics have other class-like axes (other splat types), then varying the character along those axes may be plenty. In HQ, having multiple warriors isn't that big a deal, especially if they are in different cults, or from different cultures. So I'm responding under the assumption that there will be nothing quite as important as these classes to the character. But if there are, and it's clear in chargen that this is the case, then I might choose to play a princess too.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my reaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76470/#Comment_76470" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T12:19:24+00:00" title="June 18, 2007 12:19PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i'm not sure why they're called classes?  why not roles?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76481/#Comment_76481" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T13:24:02+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  1:24PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Cyberpunk 2020 they are called roles.<br><br>I was thinking about this whole class mess and I would rather not call it archetype. Classes are archetypes per se as the common meaning of the word, but when you open an RPG and you find archetypes, that means it has another method for character creation wich gives you much freedom and archetypes are examples wich are there for you if you don't know the setting well enough to use that freedom. (Like in Kult it can be hard for a newbie to make up an archetype, but you can find some after the rules of character generation.)<br><br>I think classes as in D&amp;D only work if they are locked (you can't make up your own class) and cover all the possibilities. Let's assume the writers of D&amp;D weren't total scuttleheads and made this right. (I don't think that, but let's just assume.) I like the Ron Edwards' definiton of class, wich is when you choose your class, you choose your currencies. This is not true for archetypes and not true for roles defined by adjectives ("good at fighting"). It is important that the list of classes is short (or at least finite) and choosing a class is the bigger part of character creation. It actually makes it easy to generate a character, if you know that a Fighter should pick Combat Feats, not Item Creation Feats.<br><br>It is important to note, that in this meaning alignment and race aren't classes. I think that this is important. Not every switch in the chargen process is class. I don't know WoD that much, but as I remember in Vampire there are only two classes: Sabbath and Kamarilla. Or better: to kill humans or the become more and more human. This defines when you get points of Willpower, so it can be called class. But the clan only defines what powers you have, as I remember, nothing world shaking.<br><br>Although I think in Cyberpunk 2020 it worked much better, than it works in any incarnation of D&amp;D. I just don't know whether those roles were classes or archetypes in this meaning. Something in between, because you don't need any more roles, but you have the possibility of creating new ones. Mathematically it's the same as having freedom in chargen, but given some archetypes for example, but in psychologically it's closer to classes.<br><br>Shadowrun comes to my mind: there are very classlike archetypes, like decker, street samurai. These are not only social roles, but you should watch the niche by choosing them. Although these are no classes at all. You have a great freedom making a street samurai or a decker. The currency is defined by the prioritizing of the areas: attributes, skills, wealth, etc. This is much more important mechanically in chargen and character advencement than whether you are a samurai or a decker.<br><br>Tell me, if the above doesn't make any sense.<br/><br/>Sorry if it is boring, but I'm again reminded at Vladimir Propp's functions. The princess is a typical example for a role in a typical folktale. It is very close to fighter-wizard-cleric-thief. Being the fighter the protagonist, the wizard is the donor, the thief is the helper given by the donor, the cleric is donor who helps. These are all active roles who strive for the happy end. The princess is a rather passive role, although not exactly. Fantasy uses its sources mostly from the first part of folktales (victory above the antagonist), but the role of the princess is in the second part. If there is no second part, she just marries the protagonist, but if there is a second part (false hero who impersonates protagonist after defeating antagonist, the father of the princess gives a task to those who would marry his daughter, etc.) the princess has a very important task: she uncovers the false hero and marks the real protagonist.<br/><br/>It's totally functional and useful and cool powers could be derived to make it into a D&amp;D class.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76513/#Comment_76513" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T14:53:42+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  2:53PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Errantry, my TSOY-based game, I introduced what are effectively classes and are very close to the D&amp;D classes, though not derived from them. Rather, I was drawing on the same classic figures of medieval story that the D&amp;D classes were based on: the Knight, the Enchanter, the Ecclesiastic, the Troubadour.<br/><br/>Because it's a game of chivalry, though, I didn't include a Thief class. The closest is the Lady, who is resourceful, quick-witted, agile and capable of resolving things without fighting (though she can usually fight if she needs to in a pinch). My model was Alianora in William Morris's <i>The Well at the World's End</i>. Nor is this 19th-century tale the first to include resourceful heroines. If anything, the Victorian collectors of folktales de-emphasized this aspect, though it never was as strong as the noble hero.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
