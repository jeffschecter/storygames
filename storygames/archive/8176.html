Would you say PTA is "too complicated for its own good"? 'Cause that game gets a similar treatment around here in terms of "how to play it right" discussion.<br/><br/>Hell, so does In a Wicked Age.<br/><br/><b>Ryan:</b> Wow. I have to confess I'm a little bewildered at your placement of Sorcerer's mechanics in your taxonomy. For starters, I think it's unfair to include "wait, we messed up" elements in your description. It adds to the apparent complexity, where if the application of the mechanic had gone off without a hitch, it would appear far less complicated. None of the other items in the taxonomy include possible screw-ups and confusion, though many of them easily could.<br/><br/>In my (admittedly limited) experience of Sorcerer, it's extremely rare to have a situation where you feel you need to add another die to someone's roll after the comparison. Sorcerer isn't a game where it's crucial to account for every possible mitigating or enhancing factor in the situation; rather you have an immediate conflict, you go with your gut on both situational modifiers and roleplaying bonuses, then roll! and don't look back. "Wait, wait, shouldn't I have gotten a die for high ground? or "hey, don't you think that stunt was worth a roleplaying die?" really have no place here. if it was so all-fired important, you shoulda spoke up before the roll. if not, suck it up and move on. I'm really not sure what priority you have, that you would assume it important to 'remember" an applicable bonus and have to add it in. "Realism" maybe? Not applicable to Sorcerer, at least not in this sense.<br/><br/>In any case, I'd personally be inclined to place the Sorcerer mechanic higher on your list (it's currently number 9). probably just above number 6:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>Next: The GM rolls Xd10 based on his GMing sheet.

You win!</blockquote>\nThat "did you roll dice equal to the second number that were higher than the first number" stuff seems way more convoluted and confusing to me than Sorcerer's "line 'em up in order. and compare highest to lowest" method.<br/><br/>But I'd really like to serve <i>you</i> in the thread, which may mean getting past some of my own feelings about Sorcerer and its criticisms here. But I still don't understand what you <i>want</i>. So, how about that second part of my original question; in what direction(s) would you want to alter the Sorcerer mechanic? What does a good, "non-clunky" mechanic for this purpose look like to you? Certainly, the first 2-3 examples on your "clunkiness ladder" are much more simple than Sorcerer. But they're much more simple than, well, anything. Heck, it's not until the third step that the roll becomes anything more than a glorified coinflip. Sooo. . .just how simple (for whatever value you hold of "simple") do you want it?

Gah...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is the problem with "rules light" games.  If you play a game where the core dice mechanics are boring and uninteresting than you are motivated to use them as little as possible and wind up spending most play in free form talky silliness.  Games should have mechanics where the mechanics themselves are interesting enough to captivate attention and be something desireable to use in their own right...not as a distraction from play...but as a fun thing to actually do in and of themselves.  Much of the demand for light rules is really a demand for interesting rules worth using.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with interesting rules is that they have a learning curve to them.  Master the learning curve and the clunkiness aspect goes away and what you are left with are rules that are actually fun to use that you'll want to use frequently because they are fun in and of themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my view clunkiness as a term should refer to rules that have a multitude of steps but in the end produce no more interesting interaction or results than a simpler system.  The term should not be used for rules that have an extraordinary depth to them but which the players just haven't taken the time to master the learning curve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179889/#Comment_179889" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-23T13:14:46+00:00" title="November 23, 2008  1:14PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always had the most fun with the least mechanics, with IAWA sitting at the high end of my happy zone.  My favorite campaigns to date have been nigh-freeform without being silly.  BUt most importantly is that I find simple dice mechanics get used a lot at my table, and the fact that they're used quickly keeps players in the flow of the moment.  I'm not a fan of stopping the table to make room for the mechanics (which is why I'm not a big fan of PTA, for example).  <br/><br/>To my knowledge, Sorcerer is asking me to group, order, and compare dice, and toss out ties, but it's only offering me degrees of success and a good shot for the underdog.  Besides rolling dice from one action to the next, I don't see a big interaction between it and hte other elements of the game.<br/><br/>Anyway, the point of this thread wasn't to debate Sorcerer's die mechanics, I figured that some people out there had tried different things and was curious about what they were.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179892/#Comment_179892" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-23T13:28:42+00:00" title="November 23, 2008  1:28PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2008 1:29PM by Ry.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joel, let's say we have this (my general freeform go-to mechanic, PDQ-like)<br/><br/>2d6+X vs. Y<br/><br/>GMs state Y, players roll the 2d6+X.  <br/><br/>Now we want to add degrees of success.  So if you meet or beat Y, you get a success.  If you don't meet or beat Y, you fail.  Now, for the player, 1s are bad and 6es are good already, so let's make them even moreso, since they're already very identifiable (boxcars vs. snake eyes).<br/><br/>If you roll a success and you have a 6 in there, it's a "double" success and two sixes is a "triple"  sucesss<br/>If you roll a failure and you have a 1 in there, it's a "double" fail and two 1s is a "triple" fail<br/><br/>So essentially this is the third item on my taxonomy with a second die in the mix.  2d6+X v Y with a result that goes somewhere from -3 to +3 with a hole at 0.

Interpreting the frequency of those questions as indicating a high level of complexity, really is inaccurate.  Most of the time its an incredibly quick and simple means to resove complex goals.  Few other systems can handle so many different character goals...both opposed and orthogonic happening simultaneously with one set of rolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find most people who struggle with the system overall really don't grasp the Free and Clear stage.  That's the stage where everybody says "I am taking this action" and its important to use it to make sure its clear what everybody's roll represents.  Then you resolve those actions in the order of the rolls.  Almost any combination of results is possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179899/#Comment_179899" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-23T14:05:25+00:00" title="November 23, 2008  2:05PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Ryan:<br/><br/>To answer your question about 2d6+X vs. Y, you'll have to do some number-crunching to see whether you can get a similar range of results (and how will you handle bonus/penalty dice? Add too many and the underdog can't win anymore).<br/><br/>However, it's been my experience that, for many players, adding three numbers (your two dice plus your modifier--and there might be several of those, right?) is actually MUCH SLOWER than simply having to call out your best result. Depends how fast you are on the math, of course, but, as I said, "for many players".<br/><br/>Sometimes, "pick up an extra die" is much easier than "add X to your existing three numbers in your head, and be sure to remember which was which, etc". Consider, for instance, that you have to remember all those modifiers when the fifth player's turn comes up in a hot and sticky fight, as opposed to just picking up and rerolling the dice. Instead, you have to remember all the relevant modifiers, bonuses and penalties based on previous rolls, etc. In addition, you can't just look at someone else's dice and see what their highest die is--you have to know what the "+X" parts are before you can do that, which means more mental arithmetic as opposed to just looking at a number.<br/><br/>So, to answer your own question, you might need to try both with a varied group of players and see how they take to one method or another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179902/#Comment_179902" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-23T14:23:57+00:00" title="November 23, 2008  2:23PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2008 2:24PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, we're criticizing the Sorcerer dice mechanics in general. Let me go on record saying that Sorcerer has one of the most elegant, flexible and powerful base dicing mechanics that I've ever seen. The math is impeccable, the execution is simple and the possibilities for variation endless. Many of my own designs, including <i>Zombie Cinema</i>, basically just swipe the Sorcerer mechanics, and I'm not exactly alone in this.<br/><br/>But, to get back on topic: if you can't stand how Sorcerer does things, you just need to find another mechanic that gives you proportional resolution (the odds of value X beating value Y are X:Y) and a range of success that gets proportionally lower with larger ability scores. You could get pretty close by rolling a d20 against a table like so:\n<table><tr><td>result &lt; X+1</td><td>Ability X wins</td></tr><tr><td>X &lt; result &lt; X+Y+1</td><td>Ability Y wins</td></tr><tr><td>X+Y &lt; result</td><td>Reroll and get it right</td></tr></table>(For small values of X and Y, roll a smaller die - as long as the die size is larger than X+Y, this'll work.) Then, after you've figured out which player is going to win, roll a pool of d10 equal to the winning ability value and pick the <i>lowest</i> single value - that's the margin of victory.<br/><br/>The above is, of course, not nearly as elegant as the actual system, and it's only a rough approximation as is. But it's pretty difficult to make a system that does the same things the Sorcerer mechanic does, but simpler.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi" title="Kobayashi"><img alt="Kobayashi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zadkin.free.fr/logoBaveuse2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi">Kobayashi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179904/#Comment_179904" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-23T14:40:41+00:00" title="November 23, 2008  2:40PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played Dictionnary of Mu (using Sorcerer rules) this way :<br/><br/>Use D6s<br/><br/>1,2,3 is a failure, 4,5,6 is a success (as in <i>Prince Valiant</i> or <i>Burning Whatever</i>)<br/><br/>All the rules stay the same.<br/><br/>Works like a charm, if you're really lazy you can use Ubiquity Dices<br/><br/>I use this for my Cold City/Hot War sessions as well.

This is very important when you're in a do-or-die crisis: when things start to suck for one player, they very rapidly start to suck for everyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, because of the rollover-dice trick, players are encouraged to create little preparatory scenes for the big do-or-die moment.  Oh, I need to punch Satan in the face?  Well, I guess first I need to convince the Pope to let me bathe my hands in the blood of the Holy Grail.  And in order to convince the Pope to do that, I need to win some other conflict over here first.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetween these two rules, the Sorcerer dice mechanic is <i>also</i> a player-driven pacing mechanic.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, because Sorcerer allows you to roll any score's dice against any other score's, it's possible to have these internal monologue flashbacks (Humanity vs. Stamina, for example) which generate a bonus to a Stamina roll later on - you also have this strong incentive to show the character's inner life and past in the game: stressful conflicts, by necessitating rollovers, can bring out these hidden details and inner struggles of the character as well.  So it's <i>also</i> a player-driven characterization mechanic.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow: it's true that <i>Sorcerer</i>'s text is thick as mud.  And it's true that some system might do all of these things as well or better.  But to do all of it with a single throw of the dice isn't how I normally interpret the word "clunky."  (I'm not saying one shouldn't try to improve on this system!  Just: be aware of what the system is really doing.  Simply deciding who wins or who loses in a conflict isn't the most important thing the dice do: it's setting up fractures and stress points for the emerging fiction.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179915/#Comment_179915" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-23T16:16:25+00:00" title="November 23, 2008  4:16PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think drawing cards equal to the number of dice you'd normally roll and comparing highest would do the trick, too, if that's easier for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179927/#Comment_179927" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-23T17:44:10+00:00" title="November 23, 2008  5:44PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I. . .I guess if you say have what you want, Ryan, then Godspeed and goodnight. Personally, I don't see much advantage in Alexandre's proposal over the original rules. I guess if having to compare the two rolls is the sticking point, it does eliminate that, but then, it <i>adds</i> the step of comparing successes afterward, where Sorcerer has the comparison all bound up in the original "accounting" of the roll.<br><br>I certainly would use Alexandre's hack before I'd try any of these other weird proposals with the roll plus modifiers or the D20 table or what have you. The Alexandre method is something of an approximation of the real mechanic, and as he points out, you don't have to change the surrounding rules. It doesn't seem to address any of your fears about forgetting to add in bonus dice and whatnot, but I've already explained how I don't think that's much of a worry (Ralph's point about the Free and Clear is also relevant there). I would caution that the 4-6 Success method technically allows you to generate "successes" outside of actual opposition in the fiction (i.e. an opposed roll), which is meaningless in the original dice rules. If you do go with the alternate, I'd be real careful about letting that concept creep leak into the game--a Sorcerer roll should <i>always</i> be an opposed roll.<br><br>Good luck, man.<br><br>Peace,<br>-Joel                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179931/#Comment_179931" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-23T18:15:37+00:00" title="November 23, 2008  6:15PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>I'd be real careful about letting that concept creep leak into the game--a Sorcerer roll should<i>always</i>be an opposed roll.</blockquote>Duly noted.
