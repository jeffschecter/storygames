The Norwegian word "f\xf8ring" means a guidance, a lead, a routing, a guideline. <br/><br/>To paraphrase and translate, the definition of f\xf8ringer is something like this:<br/><b>Everything in and about a game product that causes people to play in a certain way.</b><br/><br/>This is related to the lumpley/baker-care principle, and there's some overlap, but the two are not the same. That principle states:<br/><b>System (including but not limited to 'the rules') is defined as the means by which the group agrees to imagined events during play.</b><br/><br/>While "system" focuses on what the <i>group</i> does, "f\xf8ringer" focuses on what the <i>designer/producer</i> does. Just like System, f\xf8ringer include game mechanics.<br/><br/>Let me use an example - the game "Lacuna" as played by myself and my group. When I read Lacuna, these things definitely influenced my interpretation of the game:<br/>- The game has a weird title - "The Creation of the Mystery and the Girl from Blue City (second attempt)" - which made me curious, and seemed to say "there's something here you don't understand, and it might not be entirely complete".<br/>- The book is thin, which made me think "everything in this book must be important for the play experience".<br/>- The page design shows letters appearing on the borders of each page, "eating up" the pages, which seemed to hint at several themes: The breakdown of communication, the elimination of identity, chaos destroying order.<br/><br/>When we played, I made sure to pass on the feeling of uncertainty and incompleteness to the players. From character design onward, I took care to explain less than they wanted to know at all points, made sure everything I told them seemed important, and worked with identity and communication themes wherever I could.<br/><br/>If I'd had the same rules in a book with the title "Dream Fantasy!!!", printed as a 500-page glossy pink hardback, with a cover showing an underdressed girl in a dream landscape, I would have interpreted - and played - the game differently. This would have caused me to introduce a different interpretation of the game to my group, and accordingly, we'd have used a different System.<br/><br/>I'm interested in examples of how f\xf8ringer are used in games you've designed or read. What games seem to use them consciously, and how has that affected your play? What games use them in unexpected or new ways? What games have clashes in f\xf8ringer, causing disconnect when you read them?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171647/#Comment_171647" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-27T02:44:10+00:00" title="September 27, 2008  2:44AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a really useful term! I think it's clearly relevant to the earlier discussion about Houses of the Blooded, which has a set of rules that's very to play in a lot of different ways, and then bunches of fiction, art, and play examples that guide you towards a specific interpretation of those rules.  <br/><br/>Inevitably when you're talking about clahes within a rulebook, early V:tM is going to come to mind - the game fiction, the art, the play examples, and the direct instruction of the game designers all led you to one kind of game, while the rules as written led you to another.  I think most successful Vampire play (certainly all my own successful play) involved following one side of that conflict, and ignoring the other.<br/><br/>I think game art is a really useful way to convey something about the tone of the game that the rules sometimes don't.  For example, I think the art in TSoY, as much as anything else in the book, conveys the idea that this game is not about manly men with swords hacking things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171727/#Comment_171727" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-28T01:03:09+00:00" title="September 28, 2008  1:03AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It'd be interesting to see what happened if you made a game at cross purposes with itself. Something that, as part of the game experience, required players to choose from different f\xf8ringer/routings to make the game work. Preferably in a fun way.<br/><br/>For example, a game that was supposedly a set of fragments from an archeological dig - where not everything fitted together. "We have this, which might be some sort of cover, and some fragments of text which may be from different books - and there are these cards with pictures on them, though some cards seem to be from a different set."<br/><br/>Or a bricolage design competition. "Cut apart five games you own and throw them in a heap. Draw ten random pieces from the heap. Choose eight of these to design your game from".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171810/#Comment_171810" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-28T20:06:54+00:00" title="September 28, 2008  8:06PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or a set of very, very uptight rules in a design which screams "hippy".<br/><br/>Or vice versa.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171837/#Comment_171837" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T01:05:29+00:00" title="September 29, 2008  1:05AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [whoa, i wanna play the archeology one!]<br/><br/>[jesus, that is just so cool!]<br/><br/>[later i'll get a better head around the concept and respond to that as well...]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
