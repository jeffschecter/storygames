Simon GMed, while I played the Jon Pertwee Doctor and Dave was Donna Noble.<br/><br/>It really was a lot of fun. The best bit, of course, is that you can leap straight into the fiction. Given those characters, you know <i>exactly</i> what you're meant to be doing. Dave's Donna Noble was superb, talking her way out of every situation. I made regular use of my Venusian Aikido.<br/><br/>So, we infiltrated the Library of the British Museum. There, Doctor Somebody had built an infernal machine and lots of automatons. So we fought for a while, ran about a bit and did some daring stuff. Eventually, we went to the roof, where the Rani had tied some humans to a lightning conductor. Donna rescued the humans, while I duelled the Rani. Wonderful stuff.<br/><br/>Now, the Doctor is incredibly powerful. Really, if you're the Doctor, you need never worry about failing, providing you don't fight. Talking to Simon afterwards, we agreed that the game seems to require a generous player for the Doctor: someone who will let other characters do stuff. Basically, the Doctor can do <i>everything</i>, so he needs to let everyone else have a go.<br/><br/>The system is a bit like FATE (which is a good thing). It has some nice touches: for example, in combat, Talkers go first and Fighters go last. That gets the style of Doctor Who perfectly: you can always talk someone out of fighting you.<br/><br/>I have criticisms! Often, I'd have preferred FATE to the Doctor Who system. For example, you often need to roll a Difficulty Number to succeed. When your Difficulty Number is high, this locks you in to using your most powerful skill, otherwise you fail by a long, long way. Often, I'd have preferred to use my least powerful skill, for dramatic effect.<br/><br/>But it was good. One of the best games I've played in a while. Much of it was down to the pregenerated characters, which is something I think we often forget: give people a genre they know and characters they know and they know exactly what to do with them. Lots of fun.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271048/#Comment_271048" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T21:59:16+00:00" title="May 13, 2010  9:59PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this will be the silver bullet that turns my beloved Sarah into a gamer.<br/><br/>She, of course, will have to play the imaginary Eddie Izzard doctor.

The Doctor, 8. So no it was not balanced at all. A realistic balance would have been 0 Story Points for the Doctor, and 15 for Donna.<br/>We used Tennant and tweaked it only a tiny bit. Starting from scratch with the character creation rules to create a new doctor would be fun but a little time consuming. <br/><br/>Oh, I've actually learnt the rules now rather than trying to absorb them as we played, so it might be a bit smoother next time. In particular, the GM needs to set almost unreachable targets and let the players spend Story Points to get them. The players need to know and use all the different things you can do with story points. I had a problem with story point expenditure, and that is you can buy up to a basic success, but not beyond. That would be fine if you could, separately, buy up a success to a fantastic success.<br/><br/>My other objection is the Billie Piper was used to illustrate the "Attractive" trait.<br/><br/>It's very easy to play a game in which everyone knows the background, the tropes and the characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271068/#Comment_271068" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T03:28:41+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  3:28AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2010 3:28AM by Graham.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>-did the story point economy help at all in balancing the companion against The Doctor?

Donna started with 15, I started with 10, so Story Points didn't make Donna significantly more influential than the Doctor. In practice, we both had all the Story Points we'd ever need.<br/><br/>I think the solution, really, is for the GM to give everyone a go. The companions need to be solving things as much as the Doctor does.<br/><br/>(And you understand that I'm in critical mode as I say this. I liked the game and we'll definitely play again.)<br/><br/>We made up the Jon Pertwee character. We took the David Tennant pregen and shifted some points around, so he was better at fighting.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271120/#Comment_271120" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T10:24:53+00:00" title="May 14, 2010 10:24AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there any support out of the box for running the game with every PC as one of the Doctors?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271124/#Comment_271124" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T10:48:59+00:00" title="May 14, 2010 10:48AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, it's all based around the latest series: the only Doctor is David Tennant.
