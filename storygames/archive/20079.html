I fear doing the book-keeping so much and the game suffers for it.<br/>What are your takes on this?<br/>Have you had similar problems? How did you overcome it?<br/>Like, for four or five days now, my "task" has been "transfer the time-keeping records (of diegetic events) from index cards to a calendar". I have the calendar printed out with Zakharan names and dates. There's like five or six cards. The task will probably take less than 20 minutes. I've spent days and days just postponing it, dreading it, lying in the sofa staring at the ceiling...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443780/#Comment_443780" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-07T13:03:42+00:00" title="March  7, 2015  1:03PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It only took eleven and a half minutes.

My categories (I went with the ones listed in Red Tide: People, Places, Encounters, Chronicle and Maps) don't really map what the cards are really about.<br/>I'm gonna make some new categories...

The latter seems to short-circuit prep-laziness somehow, probably because you can work on stuff whenever in whatever size blocks you feel like, rather than having a deadline in the next session or such.<br/><br/>In the middle of a campaign the best cure for the prep-lazy seems to be a) excitement about the game and b) solid procedures that leave no ambiguity as to what I should be doing and when.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443782/#Comment_443782" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-07T13:53:48+00:00" title="March  7, 2015  1:53PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, ambiguity is what leads to procrastination for me, ambiguity and guilt.<br/>If I'm not 100% sure how a particular prep subprocedure works, it'll take forever to do it, even it if did turn out easy in practice.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443783/#Comment_443783" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-07T15:00:09+00:00" title="March  7, 2015  3:00PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Find another GM to be prep-buddies with?

Is there an awesome moment that will arise when the players look at the calendar?  "Oh no, only 3 days till x!"  Or, "Wow, we've been doing this for X months and no fatalities, that must be a record!"?

Of course there's a lot of overlap between players and GMs in the circle, so there's prep you can do with the ostensible players, and prep you can't. When GMing outlier games like some of us do, though, there's a bunch of GMs you can ask to help out with the prep. "Think up seven magic items for my hoard" or "I need a OPD" or "what could a mysterious occultist want" are the sort of questions that may be pondered upon collectively now and then. Of course presence of a somewhat greater community also motivates a GM, as you want to show off and be diligent among your GM peers <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443788/#Comment_443788" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-07T20:01:12+00:00" title="March  7, 2015  8:01PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm also interested in an answer to how to kill prep procrastination.<br/><br/>I have this problem where I get an idea nugget, get excited about it, and then when it comes to adding details to make it into a workable adventure setup (the minimum being stuff like protagonists, opponents, their desires, any extras and locations) I get a blank mind and put it off until I get an idea for the rest (usually never).<br/><br/>I sometimes try to force my way through procrastination by writing down something, *anything*, in the missing places, but then the result looks so horribly boring and generic that I throw the whole idea away.

I'm not onboard with Dave completely to visualize how/if the material will come into play, I'd rather keep it skeletal so I can throw it away if the players take the game's direction elsewhere (my goal with this campaign is to run a very player driven game.

I call it a "RunSheet".  It doesn't contain stat blocks because those are all in the book or in my notes.  That makes it system-agnostic, woot!<br/><br/>The RunSheet is intended to serve as a guide for the GM during play, but I find that the act of writing my module this way forces me to think in "object by object" terms, thinking about each object (character, location or event) in isolation, giving each its own little tracks and triggers - and yet still keeping everything together and fairly easy to see all at once.  For some stories I only need one sheet.  For some I need to break NPCs out from Locations or Plot Events.  Depends on the adventure type and gameworld particulars.<br/><br/>Write whatever works for you in each little box, then you can wind em up and let em loose.<br/><br/><a href="http://asifproductions.com/sites/default/files/RunSheet_v06_WOTW.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a RunSheet for "War of the Worlds".<br/><a href="http://asifproductions.com/sites/default/files/RunSheet_v06_RJ.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a RunSheet for Act 3 of "Romeo and Juliet".<br/><a href="http://asifproductions.com/sites/default/files/RunSheet_v06.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a blank RunSheet.<br/><br/>Notes: On the left are the primary narrative Elements: Plot/Acts, Locations, and NPCs.

In the center are the Conditionals. They are linked on the left side to the Elements they may be triggered by/within. On the right are the Effects of those Conditionals, or what I call "Rails".

With regards to understanding the rules subsystems, I found that it helps me understand and remember stuff if I create my own rule reference sheets (I don't make them pretty, just copy paste stuff into tables in Word or Open Office). If you really don't like making them on your computer, maybe create hand notes with funny scribbles in between (looking a bit like the Vornheim booklet)?<br/><br/>These days I'm stuck on two things, one of them Burning Wheel (I have 2 characters from the players, I need to prepare everything else) and the other one, attempting to create a one-shot of Hot War-based adventure using this method: <a href="https://smartparty.wordpress.com/2011/12/12/hot-war-scenarios/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://smartparty.wordpress.com/2011/12/12/hot-war-scenarios/</a> (which is why I'm inventing protagonists along with background characters).<br/><br/>But it seems to be a general rule that adventures become less exciting the more I work on them.

It's something that you know when you are, but sometimes forget to notice when you aren't.  Usually if I feel a mental block, it's because I feel like I "have to" make progress on something as I've lost inspiration.  Now that I've recently learned this about myself, I am easier on myself but also make a concerted effort to seek inspiration when I start to feel bad vibes.  I get most inspiration through reading.<br/><br/><b>Brainstorming:</b> Once I'm inspired, brainstorming can happen.  This is assuming that I'm inspired about my <i>subject matter</i> rather than my processes (more on that later).  My biggest personal sin is not properly brainstorming before moving into processing.  I think a lot of analytical types like myself fall into this, and if you get more than 1 in a room you can really undermine a brainstorming session.<br/><br/><b>Processing:</b> This term is purposely vague because it totally depends on the creative activity.  When I'm working on a game, often this is the act of judging what I like and don't like, and going over design issues.<br/><br/><b>Organizing:</b> Also pretty vague.  But this is moving around processed or semi-processed ideas and content so that they are able to be worked on and ultimately consumed by someone else (or myself after I've forgotten all my design ideas!)<br/><br/>About inspiration; don't assume that it only relates to brainstorming.  I am just as often inspired to rethink an existing idea, or to reorganize existing materials because of something I read or heard somewhere.  This distinction might mean nothing to others, but it's helpful to me because it helps me to remember that just because I feel inspired in the moment doesn't mean I'm being inspired to do the <i>right thing, right now</i>.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443831/#Comment_443831" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-08T21:15:56+00:00" title="March  8, 2015  9:15PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, BJM, reminds me of Six Thinking Hats.<br/>Make a mess, then clean it up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443834/#Comment_443834" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-08T21:41:58+00:00" title="March  8, 2015  9:41PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2097, just a very basic question:<br/>Why not entirely switch over to playing <i>Dungeon World</i>?<br/><br/>This way, you could make a virtue of not preparing - and run an awesome *W game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443837/#Comment_443837" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-08T23:39:15+00:00" title="March  8, 2015 11:39PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have the DW DM move list in front of me when I DM <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>But on the prep side, I'm interested in learning/running AER-style games.

(To the point where it's hard to go back to doing it "the old way" - I don't know if I ever could.)<br/><br/>It's like Apocalypse World "provocative questions": you let the players build the world for you by asking them questions.<br/><br/>Except I like to do it in the prep phase (and not necessarily in play, particularly if it's a very traditional type of game group).<br/><br/>I ask them provocative questions and then I add a little (often random) process on my end to jumble things up.<br/><br/>For instance, let's say there's a castle and a royal family which is important to the game. I might ask: "Tell me: who is your most trusted contact in the castle? Why do you trust them so much?" Or: "Who is the most suspicious royal, to your eyes, and why?" (Name an existing NPC or invent a new one.)<br/><br/>And then I might have a list of important plot elements, like "The secret portal underneath the throne room", and I've decided before I hear the players' answers that I will roll one die for each NPC, and on a 1 or 2, that NPC knows about the portal and is somehow intimately involved with it.<br/><br/>So prep is now a mini-game. I anxiously wait for the players' reply, and then I roll the dice, and something cool comes out of it. It's fun! And, with relatively little work, I have tons of material for the upcoming game.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444154/#Comment_444154" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-17T08:48:48+00:00" title="March 17, 2015  8:48AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is exactly how I run my prep, Paul.

It's supposed to help you easily generate on-the-fly locations with encounters and important objects. I bought it recently. I haven't used it in a game with players yet, but I have played with the tool on my own - after you figure out how to create useful random tables, it seems to deliver interesting results. The tables are reusable so once you created a table for a "small village" or "wizard's lab" or "police station", you can just grab it the next time your players visit a similar location.<br/><br/>Check out the preview: <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/141633/The-Location-Crafter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/141633/The-Location-Crafter</a><br/><br/>Now I'm wondering whether I could use a similar thing to generate a relationship map.

I've got burned as a GM and I didn't wanted to ever had to made intensive prep ever again. I tried several different random tables and aids and polished my improvisational skills. I was still unsatisfied with the results. My first campaigns were good and everyone enjoyed them, but required too much prep and carefully done railroading here and there, even when they went into the sandboxing stages. The games where I tried improvising gave the players more options but weren't as good. <br/><br/>I had to find a commitment between doing good prep and improvising for the player's sake. The cognitive ability to do that was simply beyond my own brain. And so I found it there:<b> I could use the player's brains!</b> (mwhahahahahaha!)<br/><br/>Now my method for worldbuiding goes for a series of provocative open ended questions for the players and dice rolling to give a scale to any variables (amount of population, how good is doing the economy of a kingdom, number of followers of a god, size of a kingdom, etc). Then I use impro and their help to relate their answers to each other, and add anything that helps to explain the situation or plain label it as a mistery. After the basics are established I tell the players that everything they have just created is public knowledge for everyone in the setting, but not necessarily the truth, which it's for them to find out.<br/><br/>I'd still like to improve the way I create the character relationship tree, but so far things are going okey. Our current campaign is more or less sandbox and I keep asking the players for "places of interest their characters have heard of" as well as for characters and monsters they would like to find, either good or bad. For the rest, all I have to do is find out the problems arising in the setting and give them a face the players can punch or talk to if they want. Last 5e D&amp;D session I totally improvised a monster out of nowhere (well the table for creating monsters in the DM book helped a bit) and only gave it a couple of special abilities when the players rolled a 1 when facilg it.<br/><br/>The rest of the campaign is building up from the consequences of the actions of the party, which at some point went murderhobo enough to create three or four enemies of their own, which I only had to incarnate and level up into an interesting opposition.<br/><br/>I'm also trying this method to bring depth to the story: Frame the scene (I use my good old <a href="https://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2012/04/14/8/" rel="nofollow">Resourceful Deck</a>, and <a href="https://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2012/04/25/framing-scenes-with-the-deck/" rel="nofollow">here's</a> how to use it) Come up with some random twist after players have interacted with it and something happens and if I can't come up with all the details about what's going on behind it (though even If I had I still do this to see if players come up with a better idea), I ask the players to make an intelligence roll (or use any other suitable skill). The one who rolls lower starts giving their deduction about what's really going on. The next one gets to find more arguments to support that version or give another. The same goes for the next and so until all players have spoken. The last can even summarize all and go sherlock holmes about it, pointing at something everyone else has missed.<br/><br/>Players have surprised me more than once with their interpretations, which in turn have served to trigger another scene for the session or completely change my plans for it. <br/><br/>You can also google "concept art" on the web and pick up anything you find to show the players and have their minds overflowing with ideas about why are their characters seeing that and what could happen next. Even strange noises could trigger that now that I think of it.<br/><br/>Of course, treat this advice with as much honesty as you want to have in your games. If your players can take it, make it clear about these methods. Some players can't and demand that you do proper prep. It's up to you but I see no reason to not be honest about this, nor to make way too clear the details for the players, most care more about a good game that about how it was made.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444336/#Comment_444336" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-20T09:14:03+00:00" title="March 20, 2015  9:14AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2015 9:14AM by 2097.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm now once more on top of the prep.

They're guarding a mummy (not animated) who wears a ring that acts as a tiny Immovable Rod if you turn the ruby".<br/>The less is in the prep, the more freedom I have to make colorful descriptions, which I'm cool with, but I like that framework (of there <i>being</i> rooms the players can enter, leave, mess up or avoid) because it so readily affords player agency and choices and prevents me from overriding that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444337/#Comment_444337" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-20T09:32:44+00:00" title="March 20, 2015  9:32AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So two things tend to correlate with my prep procrastination.

I can feel creative but the constraints help against procrastination because I know when I'm not done -- when the numbers don't match up. I don't know when I'm done -- because I could tweak and tweak -- but I know when I absolutely am not done. I use a Emacs script I wrote to figure out the numbers for me.<br/><br/>[As an aside, I don't consider Netrunner an RPG because you can [i]only[/i] do what's in the cards. Like, you can't go to your day job unless you draw the card Day Job. You can't stay up all night unless you draw the card All Nighter etc.]<br/><br/>So that's what I want to learn, a prep procedure that's complete and sandboxy (a lot of suggestions for low-prep games are great, but I'm fallen in love with prepped sandboxy games) but that I know when it's done and that I know how to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446181/#Comment_446181" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-12T04:41:43+00:00" title="July 12, 2015  4:41AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Knowing when it's done is definitely the hard part.

I'm a huge fan of Mythic GM Emulator, so I've just bought this.<br/><br/>Asif: Your <i>ScenePlay MicroTemplates</i> are also very useful for procrastinators.<br/><br/>Has anyone thought of starting a new game/group off with <b>Microscope</b>? I usually find a session of Microscope a great start for world building.<br/>For adding random elements, <b>Fiasco</b> playsets can also be a good starting point.<br/>You can also use <b>Rory's Story Cubes for NPC backstories</b>: <a href="http://www.gnomestew.com/tools-for-gms/quick-npc-backstories-with-rorys-story-cubes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gnomestew.com/tools-for-gms/quick-npc-backstories-with-rorys-story-cubes/</a><br/>Something like <i>Dresden Files' City Creation</i> is also good way for collaborative world building.<br/><br/>Usually, <i>John Harper</i>'s designs also avoid preparation. Check out <b>Blades in the Dark</b> when it is out. It is using a set of random tables to generate the next heist, involving 1.Client 2.Work 3.Target 4.Location 5.Troubles 6.Twist/Complication<br/>The japanese Maid RPG has also a huge set of random events which helps a lot kicking things off in my opinion (for the specific genre).<br/><br/>Paul: <br/>&gt;Sometimes it's easier or more fun to write up a random table than it is to write up room descriptions... <br/>Yes, definitely! I love coming up with a quick <b>random table on the fly</b>: <br/>For any situation or question, I come up with 1-6 possible answers/outcomes (including player ideas). Then you either roll a d6 or often one idea sticks out that is really good.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
