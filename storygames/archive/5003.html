I didn't appreciate the characterization so as a joke I set out to design a game that I felt DID match his characterization.  The result is, Misunderstood: A game about friendship against the harsh cruel world.  It's basically about the crazy things we do for recognition and emotional gratification.  The problem is, the more I look at it the more it grows on me.  I really like it.  I have a lot of sympathy for the kinds of characters it tries to portray.  I'm thinking about trying to polish it up and publishing it as a nice $5-$10 pamphlet game.  It might make for a nice first publishing attempt before diving into the monstrosity that is my Silent Sound project.<br/><br/>A full draft of the game can be found here (although I've already made a few tweaks): <a href="http://bloodthorn.livejournal.com/50962.html" rel="nofollow">Misunderstood</a><br/><br/>There's one part of it that I keep staring at that I'd like some general feed back on.  Here's the relevant parts to understanding the problem:<br/><br/>Every character has a number of Friendship Points associated with all the other characters.  For Example, Amy might have five Friendship Points with Bob and three Friendship Points with Carl.  The game has a type of scene called a Friendship Scene.  In a Friendship Scene you can enlist one of the other players to help you deal with a conflict.  That player has the option to betray you and try to achieve his own goal instead.  If the player betrays you, you then have the option of spending down Friendship Points you have with that player to boost up your own chance of success.<br/><br/>The issue I'm dealing with is how one regains Friendship Points.  Outreach Scenes are pretty much all about recharging Friendship Points.  Player A basically narrates his character ranting to Player B about all the bad stuff in his life (Yes, this is basically a Smoke scene from Nicotine Girls.  No, Paul I'm not stalking your game designs, I swear).  Player A then secretly chooses whether this a sincere outreach or a self-destructive grab at validation.  The game refers to this as the Save Me/Hate Me choice.  Player B then decides whether he's going to respond with Empathy, Sympathy or Sociopathy.  The choices are compared against this table:<br/><code><br/>\t\tSave Me\t\tHate Me<br/>Empathy:\t+A, +B\t\t-A, -B<br/>Sympathy:\t+A, -B\t\t-A, +B<br/>Sociopathy:\t-A, -B\t\t+A, +B<br/></code><br/>The pluses and minuses indicate which player gains or loses a Friendship Point.  Now, because both choices are made blind it basically comes down to 50/50 whether you gain or lose point.  In that way it's kind of like a Humanity roll in Sorcerer.  It's very simple and quick to resolve.  However, I'm not sure I like it.  For one it IS totally random.  Also, Player B gets drawn in unwillingly and there's nothing Player B can do to affect the odds.<br/><br/>So, I thought up an alternative.  In addition to choosing Save Me/Hate Me Player A declares which one he has chosen, BUT! He can lie about it if he wishes.  Here's the revised chart:<br/><code><br/>\t\tSave Me/Truth\tHate Me/Truth\tSave Me/Lies\tHate Me/Lies<br/>Empathy:\t+A, +B\t\t-A, ++B\t\t-A, +B\t\t++A, -B<br/>Sympathy:\t++A, -B\t\t++A, -B\t\t+A, ++B\t\t+A, ++B<br/>Sociopathy:\t-A, ++B\t\t+A, +B\t\t++A, -B\t\t-A, +B<br/></code><br/>In this chart two pluses indicates that the player in question gains two points of friendship.  It should be noted that I consider Empathy to be the appropriate pair for Save Me and Sociopathy to be the appropriate pair for Hate Me.  Given that, this table introduces a sort of Prisoner's Dilemma dynamic.  It's best for everyone if everyone plays nice.  It's better for you if you're the only one who plays dirty.  It's not so good if you both go dishonest.<br/><br/>What I like about this version is 1) Someone always gains points.  2) It's not COMPLETELY random as it adds a bit of social bluffing and  trust into the mix.  3) I think it better models the sort of confused emotional landscape the game is about.<br/><br/>But I'm afraid it's overkill and too complicated.  I'm thinking about putting a playtest event for this little game on the OrcCon schedule.  I will probably test it with the 50/50 rule to see what kind of reaction that garners.  However, I thought I'd post up the idea here and see what people's gut instincts were over the two methods.<br/><br/>All feedback is welcome and appreciated.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112563/#Comment_112563" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T17:15:49+00:00" title="December  6, 2007  5:15PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My initial response to your first chart was "oh, hey, it's Prisoner's Dilemma-y," which I find interesting. My gut reaction to the second is one of ambivalence -- it may model what you're going for, but it strikes me as putting "dickishness" into the system. If that is a design goal, I think you're on the right track. If not, then the second option will encourage behavior that may be undesired.<br/><br/>Either way, this sounds interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112574/#Comment_112574" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T17:32:00+00:00" title="December  6, 2007  5:32PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I think you can probably ditch friendship points entirely and it'll still somehow work.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112576/#Comment_112576" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T17:37:02+00:00" title="December  6, 2007  5:37PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan,<br/><br/>Misunderstood is really walking a fine line.  The game is supposed to be about the tension between facing the world as a loner (the slower but more secure path) and trusting your friends (the riskier but more rewarding path).  So yes, there is a lot of opportunities for players to screw each other and that's by design.  But I want that to arise from their commitment to the fiction not just cause they can screw you over.  So yeah, fine line.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112582/#Comment_112582" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T18:07:55+00:00" title="December  6, 2007  6:07PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I second Shryeas' comment regarding friendship points.<br/><br/>Jesse, your mention of a fine line brings to mind balance and a design exercise: take a piece of paper. Draw a line down the middle, labeling on side "loner" and the other side "friends." Then write down the parts of your game that favors one side. Then consider if your game is truly walking that<br/>fine line or if it over-favors one side.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112586/#Comment_112586" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T18:48:27+00:00" title="December  6, 2007  6:48PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you guys looked at the rest of the design?  Friendship points are used a lot in the measure of the end game.  I'd rather find a way to use them MORE, not get rid of them.  Part of the original idea was that there are way less friendship points to go around than cruel harsh world points.  I wanted it to be an uphill struggle to keep the group of friends together before the cruel harsh world tore them part.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
