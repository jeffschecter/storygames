I think it has potential.<br/><br/>I'm looking for shortcuts to my understanding, not things I will repeat verbatim to the audience or anything, just organizational tools for me.<br/><br/>So i'm trying to come up with what "insert game here" can Reveal, what it Allows, and what it Exposes.<br/><br/>Essentially, Puppetland "Reveals" our dependence on out of character dialogue.  It highlights that flow of information that we take for granted, and shows us something about how we play all games.<br/>It "Allows" us to stay in character all the time, and let the Storyteller officiate with rules we all know and understand.  We can safely push and pull on the story without risking on dice.<br/>But it also "Exposes" how we don't often share the same understanding or interpretation of things.  It can happen, by this I mean, that Jeff believes one thing about the setting or the scene, based on what has been said, and that the Storyteller or another player can shut Jeff's plans or ideas down because he misunderstood.  It's particularly harder hitting in Puppetland, because the Storyteller is the final word.  Also it exposes us to judging one another on how eloquently we speak.  It's just a danger we accept when playing this game.<br/><br/>If you have a game that I should expose people to in this panel (you wrote it?  you just love playing it?  you never played it but you read it and thought it was cool?), and you want to help me understand what it does, please hit me up here (or whisper).<br/><br/>It doesn't explicitly have to be a Reveal / Allow / Expose list, again.  This is just my learning tool.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376970/#Comment_376970" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T12:31:15+00:00" title="May  7, 2012 12:31PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Suggestion - reword "your game" in the thread title.

It allows a player to assume an authorial role over their character while still "doing roleplaying" as we expect it to be: acting the part, declaring actions, reacting to GM content, and so forth. The Artha system ensures that Belief-driven play is rewarded; and in doing so, it exposes character designs that are not driven by Beliefs or goals pointed directly at the current fiction (i.e., encourages rewriting to better "ping" them).<br/><br/>Is that sort of what you wanted?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377011/#Comment_377011" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T14:33:47+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  2:33PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Harly,<br/>\nShadow of Yesterday/Solar System reveals how in-game reward affects in-game behavior.<br/>\nInSpectres reveals how empowering players does not lead to chaos<br/>\nDogs in the Vineyard reveals how player narration is related to mechanics<br/>\nFiasco reveals how creative constraint leads to fun game play<br/>\nCyberPunk/ShadowRun reveal how equipment lists can be part of the game<br/>\n  I am sure there are more, but these are the big ones for me.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377021/#Comment_377021" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T15:09:05+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  3:09PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

Like "it won't work unless we all agree to do X" or "it can feel awkward if we don't talk about X".
