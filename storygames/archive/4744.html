Once we had that down, everything fell into place (femme fatale, sleazy newspaperman, streetwise fence, etc.)</blockquote>\nSo I was like "Cool, yeah, noir. Awesome, yeah, that's totally how you would run Thief." <br/><br/>And then about an hour later, I was like, "Waitaminute, in Noir (at least the stories I know), it usually focuses on one main character.  Where do the other players fit in?"<br/><br/>So I've got some general and specific questions about your Thief game. Namely because I am a Thief fanatic. I am, in fact, these days replaying Thief Gold on Expert (currently getting the Water Talisman. Fucking tile floors).<br/><br/>So my questions are generally about Thief and also running a game based on a licensed property:<br/><br/>1) How long did it last?<br/><br/>2) Who at the table was familiar with/played Thief?<br/><br/>3) Of the ones who didn't, how did you get them up to speed?<br/><br/>4) Did you hack GURPS in any way to make it more "Thieflike"? Did everyone use 150 point characters, etc?<br/><br/>5) What were the characters?<br/><br/>6) What was the first starting event in the first session?<br/><br/>7) What was the focus/story of the campaign? Was it one overall plot?<br/><br/>8) How much "Thief backstory/In The Know" events/characters/items/places etc appeared (the boneyard, etc)? What was the reaction to them?<br/><br/>9) How much did stealth play a part in the game? If "a lot", how did you keep it interesting?<br/><br/>10) How much did the players contribute, if anything? Did they help flesh out NPCs?  Did they sometimes act the roles of NPCs?<br/><br/>11) If you could redo the campaign but change one thing about how you ran it, what would you change?<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106890/#Comment_106890" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T20:31:33+00:00" title="November  5, 2007  8:31PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/images/macro/hooray.jpg"/><br/><br/>I'll be happy to answer your questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106892/#Comment_106892" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T20:43:02+00:00" title="November  5, 2007  8:43PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>1) How long did it last?<br/></blockquote>\nThere were two big GURPS episodes and one brief MURPG episode.<br/><br/>The first GURPS episode was several years ago.

I set it around 100 years after the events in Thief 2, made everything a bit more 18th century, powder rifles and so on, and the characters were Keepers. Essentially they were stealth fantasy superheroes. I had kind of forgotten about it until I started typing. It lasted about 4 months but we didn't play every week, it was our 'off game' when everyone couldn't make it.

I also broke down the broad Actions (Black Ops) into individual actions (Stealth, Ambushes, etc.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106898/#Comment_106898" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T21:33:48+00:00" title="November  5, 2007  9:33PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>5) What were the characters?</blockquote>\nHey, I found the <a href="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/project/index.html" rel="nofollow">Website for the game.</a>  Keep in mind this was before my game websites got cool. This is actually kind of embarassing looking back at it. Thanks for saving this, Internet. Fuck you.<br/><br/>Ahem.<br/><br/><br/>First game:<br/><br/>Let Me Tell You About My Character: Fitz Hurstwood, sleazy newspaperman. In the very first level of the very first game, there's a single document that you can find that appears to be a newspaper or broadside article. I took this and ran 90 yards for a touchdown, all false modesty aside.  He was idealistic in that he believed in The People but cynical because individual people were all slime.  He actually was quite nastily manipulative, blackmailing many people for information by gaining secrets by skullduggery and stealth, and threatening to publish them. I recall from the first game when Fitz was tailing a Hammerite courier from one temple to another, he came around front, tripped the courier, nailed him with a blackjack, stole the letter and also the courier's money to make it look like a robbery. Then he dropped all the money in the poorbox at another church, and went and got drunk with what he kept for himself. He did it all for a girl who was a chief gardener for a powerful nobleman, who kept after him to give up the paper and get a real job, and was horrified the more successful he got, knowing he was doing it all for her and although he never could tell, she was hating what he was becoming. Also unbeknownst to him, he was a harbinger of the Metal Age, and so powerful pagans hated his guts.<br/><br/>My wife played Angel Fontaine, torch singer and pagan-style alchemist. Although we never talked about it until afterwards, this set us up immediately to hate each other and we did, with exuberance. The GM later told me that this actually got a bit in the way of the game at points, because she would acquire information and then refuse to share it with the group because of me. For laffo-s, she could talk to animals and was very clumsy, which always led to hilarity when she would spill a new potion all over someone.<br/><br/>My buddy played Hugh Brian. "Never trust anyone with two first names." He was a fence by day, who also brokered information for a twitchy, potion-addicted junkie type to the wardens of the city. By night he robbed, his position made him able to frame others easily.<br/><br/>We added and then dropped (as another player who I forgot to mention before came and went), a sort of Ralph Steadman-esque caricaturist who was a drunken nobleman's heir who gave inflammatory information and filthy, vicious cartoons to my character to print. Together we took the game down a psychotic tangent when we decided we would expose a nobleman's sexual debauchery and subsequent attempt to cover it up with bribes to various persons, including a wicker craftsman who made the crib for the child resulting from the union(s)....the GM had no idea what to make of this but we threw everything gleefully into turmoil.<br/><br/>The first game was just with the four of us, and as you might guess from the character description, it was more of three intertwined games as far as plotlines went.<br/><br/>This Is also a start on 6 and 7.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106899/#Comment_106899" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T21:33:57+00:00" title="November  5, 2007  9:33PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the second game, we added several characters:<br/><br/>One was a pagan druid-type who never really did much as the player was having interpersonal problems with the group and eventually left in the middle of the game.<br/><br/>Another was a fellow from an "old City family" who had a bizarre and Gothic history involving the clocktower that we see in Thief 3 - apparently that's the new clocktower, and he runs the "old" clocktower, whose clock has actually not moved, but whose occult mechanisms must nevertheless be maintained and monitored.<br/><br/>Another was a young bored noblewoman who put on a mask, dressed as a man, and robbed from the rich to give to the poor who she found worthy. My character basically provided her with publicity and cover.  "Who is the Scarlet Fox? This mysterious gentleman was once again seen, blah blah blah".<br/><br/>In the MURPG game, everyone was Keepers, as I recall we had one occult interpreter/prophecy addict, one assassin (magical ice bullets!), one poison expert, and...someone else I forget. Everyone was semi-interchangeable in their niche in that game. It was more situation/conversation/drama/action than character stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106900/#Comment_106900" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T21:44:53+00:00" title="November  5, 2007  9:44PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Before I move on, here's some stuff I remembered from reading the website:<br/><br/>Most of my points went into Fitz' contacts. Some were really bitching, others were more generic. The four orphan 'newsies' he had as his little michievious bastard imps were crowd-pleasing favorites.  A story about them below.  <br/><br/>I liked Snelling the City Guardsman, who was a bit like Benny from the Thief games (you will know Benny when you hear him, he turns up all over the place), except a little less enthused about how great he is. I remember distinctly Snelling telling Fitz something about 'not getting involved' and Fitz pointing out 'you're a City Guardsman, isn't that your job' and Snelling just laughing like Fitz was joking and Fitz laughing too, but being sort of sickened by his friend in that moment.<br/><br/>Fitz also hated himself when he worked with Lady Simms, the blackmailing bitch who had an arrangement with him that she took pains to be sure all her marks knew about. <br/><br/>The news stories on the website are from the second game, not the first...hmmm...lessee....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106902/#Comment_106902" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T21:57:52+00:00" title="November  5, 2007  9:57PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, <a href="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/project/stone.html" rel="nofollow">here's the website for the MURPG game.</a> I'm actually pretty satisfied with this one, it's a nice one-page summary easily printed out and passed around.

Naturally my character was involved because he wanted to print something about a hot girl in danger (FOX News had barely been invented at the time, actually. I am that good.)  I think the fence was Angel's contact for finding out more about the coin. We all had our own individual problems as well, but in true classic mystery/thriller fashion, what started as a minor but shocking crime escalated into a mysterious force that threatened the city, dunh dunh duhhhhhh.<br/><br/>Angel was basically a decent person, so she wanted to stop this from happening, the bad guys wanted it to happen in secret so they hated that Fitz was yapping at their heels every few minutes, and the fence was basically cajoled into helping by his two associates.<br/><br/>Oh, uh, I answered 7 here too.<br/><br/>The second game, you can get a bit of the plot (and side plots) from the website, the news stories, etc. Essentially a mysterious jewel was stolen that had previously been stolen from the clock dude and had terrible occult powers and was awfully cursed. Bloody mayhem ensued.  Since we had added someone with a personal stake (clock guy) and someone who was a do-gooder (noble girl), they were happy to jump right in.  There were still a lot of individual plotlines, which turned out to be sort of problematic because we hadn't really identified who was interested in whose spotlight time in the group at that point in our history and there was a lot of boredom while waiting to play.<br/><br/>MURPG was mission based. Hey, something is happening over there. Go and look at it and report. Oh noes, it threatens the balance. Go and fix it and if you have to do anything make it look like an accident.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106907/#Comment_106907" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T22:16:11+00:00" title="November  5, 2007 10:16PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>8) How much "Thief backstory/In The Know" events/characters/items/places etc appeared (the boneyard, etc)?

The way we kept it interesting in GURPS was by using freeform GM-description and player-strategizing to get various bonuses, using limited equipment while in dangerous areas (equipment was often handwaved for people who weren't Fitz because they had money and the whole game took place in the City).  <br/><br/>In MURPG, the whole game is basically about finding situational modifiers, "stones in the setting" to help you with your resource allocation, so I had a fairly extensive list of stealth modifiers prepped out, including shadow levels, surfaces, etc.  If faced with a very difficult area (tile floors, bright lights, LOL Hammerite cathedral), the characters would develop subgoals (cut the lights, knock out a sentry or two in other areas, etc.) to make it more manageable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106908/#Comment_106908" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T22:16:40+00:00" title="November  5, 2007 10:16PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Actually MURPG was much better for the stealth game and I get the feeling if I worked on it just a tiny bit more it would be HUGELY much better.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106909/#Comment_106909" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T22:24:46+00:00" title="November  5, 2007 10:24PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>10) How much did the players contribute, if anything?

Nobody played NPCs except for suggesting good lines. The guy who played the clocktower guy did such a hilarious job with the owner of the club where Angel worked, he almost played him exclusively but not quite.<br/><br/>11 - I'd work more on the stealth subgame and I would have worked on making the noir <i>arc</i> of each character more obvious. Fitz is cool because I have read a million noir stories. My wife's and her friends' are more problematic, neither of them likes to lose much, but they could certainly be persuaded to "go too far" and then get angsty, that's a noir arc.<br/><br/>More questions from others are welcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106910/#Comment_106910" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T22:30:28+00:00" title="November  5, 2007 10:30PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, um, and anyone wanting to know more, the GM for the first two games is Trilobite@RPG.net, you can PM him there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George%20Shannon" title="George Shannon"><img alt="George Shannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George%20Shannon">George Shannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107039/#Comment_107039" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-06T12:10:52+00:00" title="November  6, 2007 12:10PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was pretty cool, especially <a href="/forums/search?Search=%239&amp;Mode=like">#9</a>, since I always did want a game about being sneaky.

I'm playing a Thief-based D&amp;D game right now. I don't know the video game, but we're having a great time. We've found that D&amp;D's very fine-tuned dungeon-capering skills work quite well. We have our face, our box-man, etc. I started out with some mechanical/alchemical abilities but switched to Monk for a few levels to back up our corrupt city guardsman with "scientific fencing." We're profiteering free agents, each with personal motives for robbing folks. I need money for my wildcat experiments, for instance, while the boxman is trying to buy his way out of an apprenticeship where he's obviously surpassed his master.<br/><br/>Right now we've just dropped a pagan artifact into the sea after we were duped into stealing it from the Hammerites and giving it to a noble who used it to get possessed by the Trickster and wreck the city. The DM set us up quite nicely, because the Hammerites were mostly enemies of ours and we'd been using pagan connections to grab herbal remedies (Note: With no cleric, it's very easy to be at the mercy of NPC medical help . . .)<br/><br/>No idea what's coming next, though we've skirted the edge of the sealed off quarter. Knowing nothing about the games, I'm really curious about what's in there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107043/#Comment_107043" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-06T12:35:32+00:00" title="November  6, 2007 12:35PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing with stealth that I tried clumsily to do with MURPG (and which I would work more on if I went back to it) was that you want to set up a gradation of failure modes, all the way from "Thought I saw those curtains moving...nah, probably nothing" to "Oh my god, who are you and what are you doing here?"  I tried to divide the failure modes into four parts:<br/><br/>1 - Someone saw or heard something but if they don't see or hear something else in a certain period of time they will just write it off to drafty hallways, "must've been rats", etc.<br/>2 - Someone saw or heard something and they're confident it was real, but they don't know exactly what it was and although they're more alert, and might even pass on some warnings, they're not raising the alarm.  "Something's wrong...did you see anything over there earlier?" and checking doorlatches and so on.<br/>3 - Someone saw or heard you and they take active steps to search for you, but they don't have a clear picture of what's going on. They may go and get help, or they may not, but the search at this point is precautionary and investigatory, it is  not a pursuit.<br/>4 - Someone saw or heard you and they pursue with vigor and, if applicable, raise the alarm.<br/><br/>This way we didn't run into the 'oh shoot, we blew that situation, now we have to hack our way out' problem, failed stealth situations could (as in the games) be repaired somewhat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107044/#Comment_107044" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-06T12:43:24+00:00" title="November  6, 2007 12:43PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>A story about them below.</blockquote>\nOh, ha ha, I forgot to tell this.<br/><br/>So in the first game, a terrible murder took place next to Angel's club, and then a strange funnel of birds appeared, pointing directly at her house (she had been marked by an evil pagan force, etc.).  Naturally this was big news and my character was trying to report all of it and she didn't want her career ruined so she was yelling at him to stop.<br/><br/>Then she shows up at the club one early afternoon and there's one of Fitz' newsies at the mouth of the alley:<br/><br/>"Come and see Death Alley...only thruppence my lord..." (Imagine a Oliver-style Cockney accent where 'death' is 'deaf' and so on) "...not for the timid or faint of heart...see the bloody scene of true carnage...and the mysterious funnel of birds..."<br/><br/>So she has to see, she pays thruppence and goes in. The kids have stuffed a scarecrow, splattered red dye everywhere, and then made a little model of her house out of pressboard and has a dead pigeon on a string on the end of a stick, which they whirl around like crazy and go "wooooooo". <br/><br/>The whole game broke down laughing as we envisioned the 'horrors of Death alley' in increasing detail and theatricality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
