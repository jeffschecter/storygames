You put in rules for things that you want people to focus on, and leave out rules for things you don't think are important, or don't care to see, in your game.<br/><br/>The Vanilla (the code this forum runs on) forums don't have an ignore feature. The author didn't think it was a useful addition to a community-building app. No one's stepped up to create a viable ignore feature, either. Conversations on that front over on the Vanilla Community Forums tend to be "if you want to ignore someone, <i>simply ignore them</i>".<br/><br/>That's kinda my stance, too. If someone made an ignore feature extension to be used with Vanilla forums, I'm not sure if I'd implement it here.<br/><br/>But, like my stance on gaming in general, I don't think that house-ruling a game equals breaking it, or stepping on the author's sublime vision, or anything like that. So folks here and there have "House Ruled" the Vanilla forums to basically add a mechanic they like (an Ignore List feature) to these forums. In much the same way that I forcibly add a houseruled "fan mail" mechanic to just about every friggin game I run these days. <br/><br/>So having said that, and making no judgments upon people to want to use these house-rules to make their own S-G experience better, here's two methods of implementing an ignore feature. The only thing I'll say is, after several weeks/months, take another look at your ignore list. Maybe turn it off. People change. Some people don't, so feel free to I-list them again if you want.<br/><br/>Finally, in the case that you feel someone is continuously being disruptive to everyone, hit me up via email or in a Whisper, and I'll look into it.<br/><br/><b>I: The Official Story-Games Methodology for Ignoring People.</b><br/><br/>...simply ignore them. Don't read what they say, don't respond to it, move right along. <br/><br/>Pros: Simple, easy, and lets you ignore 1-2 dumb remarks and focus on other awesome remarks by that same person.<br/>Cons: For some folks, it's very hard to simply ignore folks without being impacted by what they say.<br/><br/><b>II: The Unofficial Story-Games Methodology for Ignoring People.<br/></b><br/>* Code created by David Cleaver. Methodology for the action flow below submitted anonymously. <br/>** Requires the Firefox internet browser, and the Greasemonkey extension/toolkit.<br/><br/>1) Download the greasemonkey script from here:<br/><a href="http://dscleaver.googlepages.com/ignoreusercomments.user.js" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dscleaver.googlepages.com/ignoreusercomments.user.js</a><br/><br/>You've got to have greasemonkey an firefox to use it.<br/><br/>2) Go to the \u201cTools\u201d menu, and scroll down to select \u201cGreasemonkey.\u201d When you scroll over it a pop up will appear, allowing you to select \u201cManage User Scripts.\u201d Click on that selection and a window titled \u201cManage User Scripts\u201d will pop up.<br/><br/>3) In the window that just popped up locate the section titled \u201cIncluded Pages\u201d and click on the button that says \u201cAdd\u201d<br/><br/>A new window will pop up, in which you will enter the address of the new forum on which you wish to use the script.<br/><br/>To get this address, open a different window or tab of Firefox (using the Open New Tab / Open New Window command in the \u201cFiles\u201d menu.<br/><br/>- Go to the forum as you normally would.<br/>- Enter one of the forum discussions. Any one of them will do.<br/>- Copy the address of the forum thread page.<br/>- Go back to the window or tab with the \u201cAdd Page\u201d box open. Paste the address into the field.<br/>- You must now modify the address so that it will work with the script. This process has two steps:<br/><br/>-- Find the section of the address, located near the end, that says \u201ccomments.php?DiscussionID=\u201d. Delete everything after the equals sign. When you\u2019re done the address looks like this (with the name of the forum replacing \u201cyour-forum\u201d):<br/><a href="http://www.your-forum.com/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.your-forum.com/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=</a><br/><br/>Add an asterisk (*) to the end of the address. The example above would become:<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=*" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=*</a><br/><br/>4) Click \u201cOkay\u201d to save the new forum and close the \u201cAdd Page\u201d box.<br/><br/>5) You may need to restart Firefox at this point for the script to take effect.<br/><br/>6) Add Names to the Ignore List. Now that the script is set up for the forums you want, you can add the forum names of other people on the forum that you want to ignore. Once someone\u2019s name is on the list the content of their posts will be hidden unless you deliberately choose to look at it.<br/><br/>6A) Get the forum nickname of the person you want to ignore. Make sure you know how it is spelled, as a misspelled name will not result in the person being blocked from your screen.<br/><br/>6B) Right click on the Greasemonkey logo in the bottom right corner of the screen (underlined in red in picture 4-1). This will bring up a pop up menu.<br/><br/>6C) On the pop up menu select \u201cUser Script Commands\u201d and then \u201cAdd user to ignore.\u201d This will cause a window to pop up titled \u201cPage at:\u201d with the address of the forum page as part of the title.<br/><br/>6D) Enter the name of the user you want to ignore into the box and hit the OK button.<br/><br/>The user will now be blocked after you reload the page, or enter a new thread on the forum.<br/><br/>7) Repeat steps 6A to 6D for each person you want to ignore. <br/><br/>Pros: Is worth it if you simply can't bring yourself to manually ignore a user's comments.<br/>Cons: Complicated. Browser requirements.<br/><br/><b>NOTICE 1:</b> This method is unsupported. That is, you can go ahead and do it, but *I personally* can't help you if it breaks, doesn't work right, has complications due to forum theme/style, etc. So don't ask me for technical help/support if it doesn't work right, etc.<br/><br/><b>NOTICE 2:</b> I do not, under any circumstances, want to see the public forum games I've seen elsewhere of saying things in public like:<br/>"I can't see you, you're on ignore!"<br/>"Can someone tell me what that fucker said, I've got him on ignore."<br/>(to someone else, after 3rd person makes unfavorable comment) "Just put him on your ignore list"<br/>(after a comment you don't find favorable) "Looks like I get to add another person to my ignore list!"<br/>"Boy, my ignore list is sure growing today!"<br/>...and that sort of childish or passive-aggressive bullshit. It will not be tolerated here.<i> Do it in whispers if you must.</i><br/>(and note: I know there are at least a few people that have been using this script, or scripts like it, for months/years now here: And they've never done any of the above. So that makes me happy. Still, when I see this kind of thing at RPGNet and the like, it pushes my buttons, so just be aware).<br/><br/>Stickying for a few days.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211621/#Comment_211621" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T09:47:55+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  9:47AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, if you want to discuss the general ideas of this feature, community impact, etc, feel free.<br/><br/>If you DL/install the greasemonkey workaround and are having trouble getting it to work, <b>do not post to this thread</b>.
