I've got some ideas on how I want to approach it, but I was wondering if anyone here has any advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy intention is to:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Encourage players to create at least some Muses that tie into each other's characters.<br/>\n2. Draw up a relationship map of all the NPCs implied by those Muses.<br/>\n3. Ask each player what they want to do to start achieving their Muses, and frame the first scenes accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe session should be about four hours long.<br/>\nI'll be GMing, and I've never run Nine Worlds before.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are four players - all experienced GMs, so I have no worries about designing good Muses or proactive play. The players range from "familiar with the rules and run Nine Worlds before", to "unfamiliar with the setting".<br/>\n<br/>\nSome related threads that I've found include:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19833.0" rel="nofollow">Vaxalon and Valamir offer advice on setting up a game.</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3012&amp;page=1#Item_13" rel="nofollow">Simplifying the setting, and prepping for a two or three session game.</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAny help or thoughts would be appreciated!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anders" title="Anders"><img alt="Anders" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anders">Anders</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100638/#Comment_100638" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T04:05:23+00:00" title="October  3, 2007  4:05AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Steve,<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you've played this, how did it go?<br/>\n<br/>\nI might play a one shot of Nine Worlds soon (my first) and I'm interested in hearing about your experinece.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100757/#Comment_100757" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T10:14:58+00:00" title="October  3, 2007 10:14AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2007 11:15AM by John_Harper.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doing chargen with the players is smart, Steve.

He makes a list of motivations, then each player picks from the list. It's spontaneous and relatively quick. Ideal for a one-shot. For Nine Worlds, make a list of Muses that people can take. For example, stuff like: <br><br>List 1<br>In love with the Martian Legion Commander's wife.<br>Wants to kill Eros<br>Transporting stolen keys to the Ninth Gate to Apollo.<br>Find Atlantis and assassinate its king.<br><br>List 2<br>Needs to infiltrate the Aquarians inner circle.<br>Start a civil war on Luna.<br>Free father from Uranus prison camp.<br><br>Etc.<br><br>This isn't an especially coherent list -- it's just examples I came up from the top of my head.

I cannot recommend Nine Worlds highly enough. It's basically no-prep at any stage. The Muses create rock-solid ideas for conflicts, the resolution system and rewards are intuitive, and the setting is totally customisable by the group. I've been recommending this to everybody.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://nzrag.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=1620" rel="nofollow">Our thread, analysing the game, is here.</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJohn, the technique you suggest for a 'situation set-up' is a good one. I read out brief summaries of all the worlds, and we hooked onto the Twilight Fever / Apollo-and-Hades-have-cut-a-deal material. Out of that we got characters:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Asariel, the dead son of Apollo. Died of the Fever, escaped from Hades as a shade, is coming to warn Apollo.<br/>\n- Makarios, an adventuring traveller transporting Asariel to Sol.<br/>\n- Caros, a double-agent working in Sol's underworld. His girlfriend is dying of the fever and needs medical treatment.<br/>\n- Dr Daedalus, an honoured physician searching for a cure to the Twilight Fever, and absolutely loyal to Apollo.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favourite NPC of the game was the Twilight Fever (Power 9).<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt, you've got an unbelievably good game here. I have some ideas about its presentation that I'd like to pitch to you, and I'll email you over a scan of the handout I made for how Points get distributed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100904/#Comment_100904" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T16:54:28+00:00" title="October  3, 2007  4:54PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great to hear it, Steve!
