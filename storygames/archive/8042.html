After one session, a rather interesting question came up: How, mechanically, can you kill characters in this game?  Here's my theory on it:<br/><br/>There's two ways<br/><br/>1) Madness dominates too many times, you become a Nightmare. Ok, that's easy enough.<br/><br/>2) You get 7 exaustion, crash, and lose all your madness and exaustion dice. At this point, you're kinda an NPC. The GM can set a conflict with the stakes of "If I win, you die". he rolls pain vs your discipline if you're awake (here's where the other players should help!). If he gets his stakes, that's it, you're dead. <br/><br/>As far as I can tell, these are the only two ways to mechanically write a character out of the game.  Another option could be that the GM could set those stakes at ANY point, not just after you've crashed, but that doesn't sound right to me.<br/><br/>How have some of you handled this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177417/#Comment_177417" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T11:43:32+00:00" title="November  5, 2008 11:43AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pretty much with 1 and 2.

The crash is survivable... I've got some thoughts on continuing to play while crashed (because I find the prospect of a crash resulting in a negation of play sort of meh).  <br/><br/>There's all kinds of ways to fuck a character up without resorting to the death-stick... stakes which hurt their loved ones, which leave them wounded and bleeding, torn up, scarred, wanted by the law, hated by their family, or responsible for murder.  <br/><br/>But if you really need death, set those stakes and throw some pain.  The players can almost always win.  If they use their Exhaustion talent and Madness talents, it's damned hard to beat them even with a huge pile of Pain dice.   They'll pay for it later, but right now, they can kick your ass if they want to really bring it.  And this is very much a feature- some of the best tension in the game comes from that internal crisis math.  Do I say "fuck it" and drop six Madness, or do I risk Pain winning, and lumping the stakes?<br/><br/>-B                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177479/#Comment_177479" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T18:27:21+00:00" title="November  5, 2008  6:27PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kevin,<br/><br/>I have kind of an unconventional reading of Don't Rest Your Head but basically yes, I'd simply set the stakes (does DRYH have Stakes, I forget) at being character death at any time if that's appropriate.  The issue is what defines "appropriate" and to me that is highly contextualized by how the player answered the five questions at character creation.<br/><br/>Otherwise, yes, stick to threatening things the character values.  This is probably a the biggest flaw in Don't Rest Your Head.  Given that you're kind of an outsider in an alien world there's little to care about other than OMG What's Going On!  The solution again lies into looking at how the player answered the five questions and metaphorizing that material in the Mad City and making the NPCs that reside there grabby and meaningful.<br/><br/>I also use a slight setting drift that I don't think is unsupported by the game but it does require reading a bit between the lines.  I don't think that crashing should equal death.  Instead I think crashing means you have to spend sometime back in the City Slumbering.  Basically, you have to confront the real life issues that your insomnia is causing.  You just don't have access to Exhaustion and Madness in the City Slumbering.  Any conflicts there are just straight Disciplin vs. Pain.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177488/#Comment_177488" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T21:16:56+00:00" title="November  5, 2008  9:16PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>This is probably a the biggest flaw in Don't Rest Your Head.

The stories have always revolved around the questionnaire, dealing with "What just happened to you?" and trying to get to "What's your path?" I never felt any trouble caring about the fiction and my character.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>It was hard to put a character in jeopardy when she knew I couldn't really kill her.</blockquote> For me DRYH always is about a death spiral of success (stole that quote from Steerpike). The players can basically succeed at anything if they want to bad enough, but the GM can use the amount of pain to keep pushing you towards crashing or snapping. Its not about putting the character in jeopardy on any one particular conflict, its whether going for the win on this conflict is going to mean I don't have anything left later. I don't see this as a flaw. Its a feature.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177491/#Comment_177491" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T21:41:18+00:00" title="November  5, 2008  9:41PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's funny.

Using the questionnaire is key.  However, the basic conceit is that the character has been removed his normal life and usually only one key element of the character's life may have crossed over with the character.  Like the answer to "What's just happened to you?' might be, "My kid just crawled under the couch and disappeared.  So now there's you the kid in the Mad City.<br/><br/>But if the answer to, "What's been keeping me awake?" is "There have been several layoffs at work, my boss hates me and I'm due for a performance review"  You're not very likely to encounter your boss in the Mad City.  However, to me, what you do is have the kid lost in some weird nightmarish corporate maze alla the movie Brazil.  You maybe create a boss-like Nightmare that runs the place.<br/><br/>So perhaps, "flaw" was the wrong word.  I meant more like, "point that requires some thought and skill."  My own game Silent Sound "suffers" from the same problem since it's also about people who are drawn OUT of their normal lives into a place of weirdness.  Hopefully I've accounted for that as well as Don't Rest Your Head has.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177501/#Comment_177501" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-06T00:22:53+00:00" title="November  6, 2008 12:22AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Death Spiral of Success I don't think was original, but I can't recall where I heard it...<br/><br/>My reading of the game is with Jesse, sometimes Death is a stake and on the table when it seams right for the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177502/#Comment_177502" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-06T01:07:44+00:00" title="November  6, 2008  1:07AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is the way I explain this matter to the people I demo the game to[*]:<br/><br/>As you can see from the sheet, there is no wound or hitpoint mechanic. Your character's story can end in 3 ways: you become a nightmare, you crash (and decide not to try to be saved by your friends), or you put your life as a stake. Also, mind you, I as GM will never ASK your character's life as a stake of a conflict. It's much, much less interesting than fucking with your character in other ways. But if you as a player feel that this is a moment where the character could consider giving his life for what he wants, roll with it: you lose, you're dead.<br/><br/>And it happens. We were in Lucca's fair last week and I run several demos of DRYH. One of the characters was a suicidal guy... in the final showdown he set the stakes as such: "If I WIN, I die". And he did (Crashing in the same roll, also). The player was thrilled.<br/><br/>Oh, and... pictures!<br/><a href="http://picasaweb.google.it/renato.ramonda/LuccaComicsAndGames2008#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://picasaweb.google.it/renato.ramonda/LuccaComicsAndGames2008#</a><br/><br/>[*] I'm one of the publishers of the Italian edition                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser" title="kevin.weiser"><img alt="kevin.weiser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.finitesite.com/spiderlegs/wlkngI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser">kevin.weiser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177540/#Comment_177540" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-06T08:04:14+00:00" title="November  6, 2008  8:04AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so I think I get it now.<br/><br/>PC death can happen any time stakes are set for it. It is up to you and your players to decide if those are appropriate stakes. your miliage may vary. One very good time to try is after a crash either while they're asleep (only friend's helping dice can save you!) or when they're awake (you can't use madness or exaustion until you've been up long enough so you only get your 3 discipline, better have friends help!).<br/><br/>All in all, I really like how this is set up. Death only happens when it's going to be cool and everyone's ok with it being on the table. That is *incredibly* freeing as a GM. You are free to abuse and molest in all variety of ways without having to worry about a random roll ruining all your fun. With stake setting and the domination's as guidelines, it's possible to create visceral, dynamic stories that can surprise everyone at the table yet still remain "fair".
