Not actual gaming groups, specifically, but groups of people who tend to play together and tend to play the same games. There has been the odd person or two moving from one to the other, but mostly that never happens. Each of these groups has a different play culture, different approaches to playing rpgs, different collections of gaming techniques, and (for the most part) they play different games.<br/><br/>Recently, however, I played Traveller with all three of them, the only time all three have played the same game, and the only game to ever be played by all three (or at least: by a significant portion of all three and with me present\u2014all three groups include people who have played AD&amp;D, after all).<br/><br/>So, I decided to write down some of my observations. Actually, I decided to do that after two groups played Traveller, and then I decided to run Traveller for the third group myself, partly so that I could do a three-way comparison and partly because I liked the trading rules we weren\u2019t using in the other two groups.<br/><br/>I\u2019m going to call these three groups old school, trad, and story games. I use these names because they are at least somewhat accurate and a good portion of the people in the old school and story games groups self-identify as such (the trad group doesn\u2019t self-identify as anything, really), even though they don't tend to post to these forums much, or much anymore. I post here way more than anyone else in the group I'm calling story games.<br/><br/><b>LET ME BE CLEAR:</b> These names are not an invitation to flame war, edition war, play identity politics, scene-bash, trash-talk, create cross-forum drama, create any other kind of inter-personal drama, or make claims about social issues, and if you find yourself compelled to make statements along any of those lines please do me and everyone else a favour and go fuck yourself instead.<br/><br/>The following observations are about the procedures, mechanics, and social contracts of game play, and they are about game design. None of these observations should be assumed to apply to play cultures that I do not participate in or to people I have never played an rpg with. I will not be discussing the people in these groups outside of the way the games I play with them are played (although some of them are on the internet), and I am not trying to make social claims or value judgments here, either about the playing or the people. Even if it seems like I am complaining sometimes, these people are all my friends and I enjoy playing rpgs with them all. I\u2019m just really good at complaining, you see, and I can\u2019t always contain myself, so judgments about written rules systems will be made, but that\u2019s the limit.<br/><br/><b>Three Traveller Games</b><br/><br/>First I started playing a game of Traveller with the trad group. Then a DM from the old school group decided to run a few sessions of Traveller. Finally, I decided to run a version of Traveller for some of the story games people. There is almost no rules overlap between the three groups, except for trying to roll high on 2d6.<br/><br/>In the old school group, we used classic Traveller rules, with MegaTraveller character creation and various supplementary character careers (so we had a Catholic priest, an assassin, a wastrel, a scientist, an ex-cop, etc). The first hit in combat doesn\u2019t all come off the same stat, and the DM rolls randomly for which stat each die reduces I think. We only visited two different planets and the DM used published adventures most or all of the time.<br/><br/>In the trad group, we use a heavily house-ruled version of the MegaTraveller rules with custom point-buy character creation rules. We do use the rule that the first hit comes off one stat, so the one rule from classic Traveller the trad group retained is one of the few the old school group doesn\u2019t use. The trad group uses custom stat mods for skill rolls and modified difficulty numbers, and there\u2019s a couple extra derived stats. The GM uses a section of the official MegaTraveller map with some custom worlds on it. I don\u2019t actually know how many of the worlds we have visited were created especially for this game, but I suspect all the ones we actually remember are original. We used the speculative trade rules (from MegaTraveller, not classic Traveller) a couple of times but I think they are terrible rules and my opinion has been amply demonstrated to the group, which has led the GM to house-rule or hand-wave a bit to fit the game setting. The GM has an adventure prepared, which includes a treasure hunt, so it\u2019s at least somewhat linear.<br/><br/>For the story games group, I created the setting using the world/starmap generation rules in classic Traveller, so we could use the trading rules. We started off using classic Traveller character creation, minus the random character death, then converted the stats over to a modifier and used the Apocalypse World rules to resolve everything. Since we have been playing, we have switched to characters that fit the AW rules a little more and I have expanded the speculative trade rules considerably, which is what gets the most amount of use. I use a lot of random tables to generate content and occasionally I invent situations for the PCs to become involved in, if they want, but mostly it\u2019s monetary gain that drives them through play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433150/#Comment_433150" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-28T17:20:49+00:00" title="May 28, 2014  5:20PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Other Games</b><br/><br/>The old school group plays various versions of D&amp;D, and also a few sessions of Traveller, obviously. Someone recently ran a few sessions of Stars Without Number for a few of us, which was also fun and felt a bit like Traveller. The rules this group uses tend to be a bit of a jumbled mess (the number of spells my cleric has depends on the DM, for example), but these guys know which kind of game they want to play and that\u2019s what we play. There\u2019s not a lot of wandering off or compromising between different play goals\u2014it\u2019s all murderhobo rampaging over the DM\u2019s prep, all the time.<br/><br/>With the trad group I have played Call of Cthulhu, Fudge, a home-brewed system using cards instead of dice, and now Traveller. I played a lot of Call of Cthulhu as a teenager, but it was closer to the old school group than the trad group. These days, I see Call of Cthulhu the way I learned how to play it (from modules) as being a lot like old school D&amp;D but with the players exploring unfamiliar relationships instead of unfamiliar locations. The trad group plays more like how I used to play pretty much every other rpg, though. Vampire most of all, but also GURPS, various Palladium games, Ars Magica, Warhammer FRP (Shadows over Bogenhafen and Death on the Reik, for example), and maybe Cyberpunk 2020, too. And whatever the hell else we played, I guess, there was a lot. Characters and their histories matter, and there\u2019s \u201cadventures\u201d instead of dungeons, but the GM\u2019s prep still takes precedence over character histories, and the GM is still expected to create both the setting details and all the situations.<br/><br/>The story games group plays a lot of GM-less games, but they aren\u2019t really germane to this discussion, so I\u2019ll concentrate only on GMed games. The one we all have a deep and abiding love for is of course Apocalypse World, along with its spawn, especially Monsterhearts and Dungeon World. Others that have been played include Burning Wheel, Mouse Guard, Danger Patrol, Ghost/Echo, and Sorcerer. We usually played In a Wicked Age without a GM, so maybe that doesn\u2019t count. From my vantage point, this group (much like the larger west coast story games community) is more interested in playing scenes, collaborative world-building, and tightly-designed mechanics, than in other aspects of rpgs (like wargaming elements, exploring the GM\u2019s world, or verisimilitude, for example). My Traveller game is primarily focused on getting those mechanics tightly-designed, so it is perhaps a bit of an anomaly as far as this group\u2019s play styles go.<br/><br/>Before I started playing story games (or indie rpgs or Forge games, or whatever label you want) I didn\u2019t play much of anything in a similar style, except maybe Kult. When I ran Kult, the players came up with elaborate backstories for their PCs and I drew all the antagonists and situations I presented in the game from there, to make the game actually be about their characters. It was a lot less efficient than asking provocative questions and using the answers, but it was a similar idea. We did try experimenting more with scene framing in Vampire, though.<br/><br/>Note, however, what I wrote about Call of Cthulhu, above, and realize that games aren\u2019t the defining feature of a group and the way it plays. I\u2019ve run Apocalypse World and Dungeon World in a very old school style and while it wasn\u2019t as optimal as I would have liked, it was fun and didn\u2019t break. I ran pretty standard Dungeon Planet for the old school guys once, and they had a fun time, but they still prefer to play in the old school D&amp;D style.<br/><br/>Anyway, I include these notes to help you, the reader, understand and identify with the play cultures I am describing. Maybe you will recognize something similar to a style or styles you have played, even though your experience with rpgs and the people who play them is different from mine, perhaps vastly different. I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ve finished the lit review section of this essay and now it\u2019s time to get to the actual anecdotal observations, in no particular order.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433151/#Comment_433151" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-28T17:21:37+00:00" title="May 28, 2014  5:21PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2014 5:09AM by Johnstone.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>GM Prep and Adventures</b><br/><br/>In the old school group, the DM uses a combination of a prepared map and random tables to determine the world around the PCs. Plus maybe some prepared missions that the PCs can accept or decline.<br/><br/>In the trad group, the GM is expected to prepare some vague amalgamation of stuff that constitutes an adventure. This seems to be a combination of notable NPCs, mapped locations, and situations that are supposed to happen to the PCs. Sometimes there is a vague \u201cplotline\u201d that the PCs follow, but it doesn\u2019t usually seem very strict or railroad-y.<br/><br/>In the story games group, the GM expects to be able to rely on the game\u2019s procedures to help generate situations to put the PCs in, without prep (or much prep). But it\u2019s generally expected that the players will provide a bunch of ideas they want to happen, and the GM will choose from those, add to them, and throw them at the PCs.<br/><br/><b>Introducing Characters</b><br/><br/>In the old school group, the DM has a map or some other sort of prep done, and the players make characters in order to engage with that prep. Whether they are suited for it or not is pretty much irrelevant, and we handwave motivations away or just assume the PCs are out for money/treasure.<br/><br/>In the trad group, players are usually allowed to make whatever kind of PCs they want, and then the GM is expected to hook them into the prepared adventure. Usually, there\u2019s still a bit of bending on the part of the players to form an rpg party, but work is done to make sure there\u2019s some sort of plausible explanation for PCs to be on the adventure (just not so much during the actual character creation phase).<br/><br/>In the story games group, the premise and setup are pretty explicitly focused on what is going to happen in play. If a specific sort of adventure is desired, those specific PCs are the ones that get made and played, and the adventure stems in large part from them. So the plausibility of the situation is handled during character creation (or even in the game design process, if you want to think of it that way).<br/><br/><b>Character History and Identity</b><br/><br/>In the old school group, your character\u2019s past is not even a consideration. Yeah, you roll up some life terms in Traveller, so what. Nobody cares where your dude came from, where he grew up, or what he did before the game starts. You will never be somewhere you know, there will never be people you went to school with there. It will always be foreign. The game starts at \u201cYear Zero.\u201d<br/><br/>In the trad group, you\u2019re expected to have a past fleshed out for your character, but it is treated like equipment. You need to have it written down on your sheet so you can use it to your advantage during the game. The GM may occasionally pull in something related to it, although sometimes this feels like a hook to keep the player involved and connected to the main story (one of the things the GM is expected to do, as mentioned above), which has nothing to do with the characters themselves being central to the \u201cstory\u201d or the series of unfolding situations.<br/><br/>In the story games group, the game is expected to involve the characters or even fully revolve around their pasts and who they are. The GM is supposed to ask questions about the PCs and then weave those details into the situations they find themselves in. The Traveller game I\u2019m running actually deviates from the story games norm though, because it focuses on the design of certain rules (the ones for interplanetary trading), and not so much on the characters as people. The story games group has more people who are really into game design and writing and publishing games, so occasionally this sort of thing happens. There are a number of other AW hacks for Traveller that function exactly as one would expect a game I play with the story games group to function, though.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433152/#Comment_433152" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-28T17:22:26+00:00" title="May 28, 2014  5:22PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Playing the Character</b><br/><br/>In the old school group, acting out a funny character is a fun thing to do, but for the most part the character is the player\u2019s vehicle through which to explore the DM\u2019s world. If you don\u2019t know the rules very well, your character may well die because of it. This is part of the learning process. You can make decisions either as your character or as a player, but other people tend to get annoyed if you role-play a stupid character and get their characters into trouble when you as a player should know better. Reckless action as a player is okay if it only endangers your own character though.<br/><br/>In the trad group, a certain level of \u201crealism\u201d is desired and you are expected to play an actual character with a history and a personality, but you still make tactical and strategic decisions as a player. There is a tension between skill and perspective taking and the player is expected to balance both of them. The GM\u2019s prep still gets more spotlight than player prep does, if that makes any sense.<br/><br/>In the story game group, you are expected to play the character. If you as a player want to do something different, you change your character. Making a sub-optimal tactical choice because you are playing your character is something we all expect the rules to allow and even celebrate. Being punished for poor player skill in navigating rules is considered bad form for a set of rules to exhibit.<br/><br/><b>Character Sheet Lists</b><br/><br/>In the old school group, you have your equipment written down on your sheet, that\u2019s what you get to use, along with whatever powers you have. If you didn\u2019t write it down, you don\u2019t have it, with the exception of clothes and a few personal items. Where you keep all your gold is sometimes up in the air, though most players assume their characters carry it all around with them.<br/><br/>In the trad group, you have your equipment written down, that\u2019s what you get. Your character history should also be written down so you can reference it for leverage and information during the game. It functions basically like equipment and powers. Clothes and personal items are simply assumed, not described. The trad group doesn\u2019t use treasure as xp, and always plays games with paper or digital money, so PCs don\u2019t wander around with tens of thousands of coins in their pockets.<br/><br/>In the story games group, you are assumed to have what your character would have, for the most part. In some situations, you need to describe your gear, but even then there is usually room for \u201cslots\u201d of undetermined equipment that can be defined during play, after a situation has been introduced. Often, the portrayal of the character comes first, over preparation and player accounting.<br/><br/>Generally, in old school and trad, you are expected to define all the important abilities you have access to before going into a situation, either by discussing it with the GM or by having it written down on your sheet. Also in some cases, if you don\u2019t say specifically you are doing something, the GM rules you didn\u2019t do it (sometimes it is a case of not having the scene described in enough detail, though). In the story games group, the emphasis is less on player skill and more on playing the character, so it\u2019s fine to invent or decide on certain details during the action, even though the character would have made them beforehand.<br/><br/><b>Character Death</b><br/><br/>In the old school group, character death is expected, rampant, and often meaningless. The passing of a beloved character may see a short moment of anguish. Then a new character is rolled up. Sometimes people forget to bring their old characters, or can\u2019t find them, and so they roll up new characters, and we often play with two PCs each, so the attitude generally is that PCs are fairly disposable. Near-Total Party Kill moments are still harrowing and exciting, however, because we like kicking ass and taking loot, but a TPK would not bring the campaign to a halt. We would simply make new characters and try to find the dead ones so we could take their stuff.<br/><br/>In the trad group, the death of a PC is monumental, and it is assumed that the player feels really bad about it. Even so, some deaths are pretty epic and fondly remembered. It can still be really gripping to be a hair\u2019s breadth away from a TPK, but a TPK would also end a campaign permanently, which is seen as a bad thing.<br/><br/>In the story games group, the game determines if and how PC death is on the table. In some games it is hard without the player\u2019s consent, some games don\u2019t have PC death in them at all, some it\u2019s a possible thing. Usually, PCs don\u2019t die that often, since the games are supposed to be about them and it usually stops being about them when they die.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433153/#Comment_433153" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-28T17:23:14+00:00" title="May 28, 2014  5:23PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Campaigns and Adventure Times</b><br/><br/>In the old school group, a campaign setting never dies and is used whenever the DM wants to run it. Whichever PCs show up is usually fine. There are several regular DMs in this group and each have more than one setting/campaign going on, plus there are a few casual DMs who run games now and then. Usually a \u201ccampaign\u201d is conceived of as a setting, too, since PCs are not linked to any particular setting, but may move between different games at will.<br/><br/>In the trad group the normal campaign length is a year and a half. A campaign is conceived of as a mission-based situation that a specific group of PCs are involved in, and not usually an ongoing occupational-type thing. It\u2019s something extra-ordinary and temporary.<br/><br/>In the story games group, one-session games are the norm, but Apocalypse World campaigns have been known to reach 14 sessions. A campaign is usually the PCs in some sort of situation, but not necessarily extra-ordinary. Like Mouse Guard is guard-mice doing their thing and Apocalypse World takes place where the PCs live.<br/><br/><b>Scene Framing and Time</b><br/><br/>Only the story games group ever does any real, deliberate scene framing stuff.<br/><br/>The old school and trad groups rely on the you-go-here-then-what type of formula. This works pretty well for dungeoncrawls, where scene-framing is bad, but outside of dungeons we tend to follow the characters around a lot. The old school group will go with mild scene framing sometimes to skip stuff we don\u2019t care about, and get to important encounters.<br/><br/>There\u2019s more elasticity to time (outside of combat) in the old school group than in the trad group, which tends to pixelbitch more often. Some people in the story games group tend to pixelbitch too, but they try to get more done when they do it, the trad group pixelbitches when it comes to preparation.<br/><br/>Story games people tend to complain when they don\u2019t get the scenes they want, though.<br/><br/><b>Initiative</b><br/><br/>The old school group goes back and forth between individual initiative and group initiative. Usually it\u2019s re-rolled at the beginning of each new round. Traveller is supposed to be simultaneous, but it hasn\u2019t really felt like that.<br/><br/>The trad group uses individual initiative, rolled once at the beginning of each combat.<br/><br/>The story games group has never really used initiative, since we played Burning Wheel and In a Wicked Age before Apocalypse World. There might have been some sort of initiative in Sorcerer, but if so it was probably just a speed-based conflict. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of fights.<br/><br/>Here\u2019s an interesting example:<br/>In the old school Traveller game, my character the ex-cop, walked into an office with his gun out, commanding the goon behind the desk to get his hands up. I had not actually read the initiative rules in classic Traveller, however, so I did not know that what happened next was a roll for surprise and then simultaneous actions. What ended up happening is that because my dude had no leadership or tactics skill, and the goon did, the ensuing gunfight put my dude out of action before the goon (who was taken down by the next PC into the office).<br/><br/>The trad group thinks it\u2019s ridiculous that leadership or tactics skill lets you get your gun out faster, and would have had the goon make a roll of some kind to see if he could get his gun out fast enough. The dichotomy here is that the old school group plays the game selected and if your character has to die so you can learn the rules, so be it, and the trad group is looking for verisimilitude. Not necessarily genre-based or theme-based verisimilitude, either, but often \u201crealism.\u201d So a lot of stuff in the Traveller game tends to be based on modern assumptions of stuffs.<br/><br/>The story games group, of course, would simply have me roll to go aggro (from AW), because that perfectly emulates the experience of drawing down on a guy like my PC did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433154/#Comment_433154" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-28T17:24:00+00:00" title="May 28, 2014  5:24PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Verisimilitude and Realism</b><br/><br/>The old school group plays deliberately fantastic games and doesn\u2019t care that much about realism or verisimilitude. Occasionally we joke about it or I give the DM some shit about how ridiculous something is and he laughs it off. Occasionally, one DM has threatened to calculate real-world physics in order to justify something, but this is also a bit of a joke because dude, it\u2019s magic, fuck off.<br/><br/>The trad group likes a certain amount of verisimilitude. They\u2019re willing to sacrifice it for the sake of speed and whatnot, but the real interesting thing is that it\u2019s a bit patchwork. Christopher Kubasik wrote in another thread on SG about how Dune has all this history written for it, but Herbert was only talking about certain specific themes, so he ignored all the other stuff (although for the life of me I cannot figure out what the fuck Herbert is actually trying to say with his Dune novels). With the trad group, it seems to be less about central themes or genre or premise necessarily, but a collection of idiosyncrasies and smaller issues.<br/><br/>The story games group, being fond of both focused design and top-down redesign, care quite a bit about premise, genre, and emulating an experience rather than physics or action or really much of any of the stuff at the wargaming end of the rpg spectrum. Verisimilitude that fits a game\u2019s premise should be encoded in the rules, verisimilitude that doesn\u2019t fit the game\u2019s premise should be ignored, seems to be the basic philosophy. That said it\u2019s not quite like the old school group, because over there we bend the premise of the fiction and setting to fit the game we\u2019re playing, and the story games group ditches a game if the rules don\u2019t fit the premise that we want.<br/><br/><b>Random Tables</b><br/><br/>The old school group uses random tables all over the place, all the time. They\u2019re pretty strict about results, too. \u201cI diced it,\u201d so that\u2019s what happens, end of story, unless it\u2019s particularly egregious. Blair destroyed his Planet Algol setting once because of a random roll (I\u2019m pretty sure he blogged about it), but another DM once rolled up too many dangerous monsters on the wilderness encounter charts and had to hold back a bit. That\u2019s pretty rare though, I used \u201conce\u201d in that sentence for a reason.<br/><br/>The trad group doesn\u2019t much care for random tables in general. We\u2019re using a random robot damage malfunction table right now in Traveller, and the spaceship combat rules rely more on random damage table rolls than on hit points, but I don\u2019t remember any being used in the past. I\u2019m pretty sure random encounter tables have never been used or even considered.<br/><br/>The story games group likes random tables, but more as inspiration than hard rules. Lists are also popular, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433155/#Comment_433155" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-28T17:24:26+00:00" title="May 28, 2014  5:24PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Final Note</b><br/><br/>Playing with these three groups has helped me figure out how to play games with other people better.<br/><br/>Way back when I first started playing Call of Cthulhu with people in the trad group (it was Masks of Nyarlathotep) I would get frustrated because we were playing up our characters\u2019 personalities a lot, but there was nothing in the rules to back that up. I would get in an argument with another player, completely in-character, and realize there was no way to resolve it. I had to either wear the other player down in real life (wasting game time in the process) or just have my character give in and get on with playing the damn game. Or resort to violence, but I mean what the fuck. I was playing Burning Wheel with some story games people at the time, too, and I kept thinking \u201cwe need a Circles mechanic here,\u201d but instead I had to just ask the Keeper if I knew someone (and the module said \u201cno,\u201d so that\u2019s what happened). He was sympathetic about this stuff too, but had to shrug and say \u201cthis is the game we\u2019re playing.\u201d<br/><br/>Nowadays I don\u2019t get frustrated over different styles that much. When I first started playing Planet Algol, after Blair had started showing up to Red Box Vancouver games, I played a bit of a trick on him to see what the limits of the game were. I made a character that had fallen through the Bermuda Triangle onto Planet Algol. Blair said I started in this desert area, where there was a lifeboat sitting around. I thought to myself, \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens if\u2026\u201d and I started describing my ship falling from the sky. Blair\u2019s eyes got real big, he pointed his finger at me, and said \u201cNoooo! You don\u2019t get to say stuff now! I get to say stuff now!\u201d And I thought \u201cOkay, now I know what game I\u2019m playing. Cool.\u201d It\u2019s pretty much always like that now. I figure out which game we\u2019re playing pretty quick, and that\u2019s the game I play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433160/#Comment_433160" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-28T22:52:15+00:00" title="May 28, 2014 10:52PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very nice!

After a couple characters got killed somebody rolled up a new one with a ship and so we went to another planet where we were trying to infiltrate an orbital station through the most murderhobo-est means we could devise.

Some ways to build on this include not only identifying specific procedures and rules that each group finds problematic and trying to replace or refine them with new ones that fit the play style better, but also trying to find out the minimum amount of optional rules a game would need in order to be played successfully by all three groups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433233/#Comment_433233" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-30T22:34:11+00:00" title="May 30, 2014 10:34PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>trying to find out the minimum amount of optional rules a game would need in order to be played successfully by all three groups.</blockquote>I'm trying to answer a similar question regarding various types of optional subsystems.

I haven't been reading that thread but it looks like it's about exploring the GM's prep? Or at least about PCs that venture into unfamiliar locations -- which could work with all three of my groups, but is really good with one (os) and rather less so with another (sg).<br/><br/>The premise I have right now is that the resolution rules are all the same across three different modes of play, but the setup for the PCs and their situation, the things they get XP for, and the basic job of the GM, is what is different. In the exploration mode, the PCs go into ruins created by the GM and get XP for valuables they recover. The survival mode is a bit like Apocalypse World but way more explicit that the PCs are part of a wilderness settlement which they create and the GM is responsible for creating threats and problems, which the players get XP for defeating. The intrigue mode builds on top of either and can even combine them, adding a social level. You can investigate mysteries (a social version of exploration) or have a faction war (a social version of survival) or go back and forth, the way a good cop show does. But most of the basic rules are all the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433239/#Comment_433239" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-31T07:16:51+00:00" title="May 31, 2014  7:16AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2014 7:37AM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice.

The examples are fictional, since I don't record my games, but do contain a few elements of actual fight scenes from actual games.<br/><br/><b>Old School fight scene procedures:</b><br/><br/>First, the DM determines the encounter. Either it is pre-written in the adventure, or he rolls a die to see if there is an encounter or not. If there is, he rolls for both sides (PCs and monsters) to see if they are surprised. A side that is not surprised gets a free round of attacks on a surprised enemy. Some rules tell you to roll for encounter distance, the number of enemies encountered, and to roll for their reaction (to see if monsters are friendly or hostile). I don't think we roll for distance ever, and not often for reaction.<br/><br/>Once the fight breaks out, we usually use group initiative. One player rolls a d6 for the PC side, the GM rolls a d6 for the monsters. PCs with positive Dexterity modifiers get to act faster, but usually we go in whatever order the players want. Whoever talks first goes first, basically.<br/><br/>Some DMs make you declare whether or not you're casting a spell before initiative is rolled.<br/><br/>Once all the players have had their characters act\u2014sometimes we play with multiple characters, and some characters also have hirelings\u2014and the DM has had all the monsters act, the round is over and we start the next round with initiative and/or declaring spells to be cast.<br/><br/>We never use the initiative phase system, where everyone moves first, then ranged attacks happen, then melee attacks, then spells. You get whatever actions you want when it's your turn to go.<br/><br/><b>Example:</b><br/>(<i>This example is actually from D&amp;D, since we normally play that, and Traveller was one of the few breaks from it that we've had.</i>)<br/>DM: You pull the lever and the wall moves away, revealing another room, where three gnolls seem to be standing around a serpent-man who is tied to a table. They turn and see you. Somebody want to roll for initiative?<br/>Fighter 1: We got a 4.<br/>DM: (Also rolls a 4) Okay, you go simultaneously. Those of you with Dexterity bonuses can act first.<br/>Fighter 2: I have a +2 bonus, I rush in and attack the closest gnoll.<br/>DM: Okay, roll to hit.<br/>Fighter 2: I roll 21, for 9 points of damage.<br/>DM: Okay, you slash him across the chest, blood pours out, he howls but he's still fighting.<br/>Elf: I have a +1 Dexterity bonus, so I'll attack that same gnoll, and my ghoul henchman will attack the second. For my elf, I roll 11. For my ghoul's three attacks I roll 6, 18, and 12.<br/>DM: What level are you?<br/>Elf: Third level elf. And the ghoul is second level.<br/>DM: Okay, so the 18 hits, the others don't.<br/>Elf: 1 point of damage, plus paralysis.<br/>DM: You see the gnoll tense up and go rigid.<br/>Elf: Sweet.<br/>Cleric: I attack the wounded gnoll. I roll 8, does that hit?<br/>DM: No.<br/>Cleric: Are you sure?<br/>DM: Yes! You miss! The gnolls attack (rolls to see who). Fighter 1 gets attacked by two gnolls, what's your AC?<br/>Fighter 1: Plate and shield.<br/>DM: One gets in between the plates of your armour, you take 7 damage.<br/>Fighter 1: I'm at -1 hit points, I'm out. Do I get to attack as well, since it's simultaneous?<br/>DM: Of course.<br/>Fighter 1: Nevermind, I rolled a 3.<br/>DM: The third gnoll attacks the ghoul, and misses. No, wait, that gnoll is paralysed, never mind, he does nothing. Next round, roll for initiative. Anyone casting a spell?<br/>Cleric: I'm casting cure light wounds on Fighter 1.<br/>Fighter 2: I rolled a 6.<br/>DM: You guys go first.<br/>Elf: I attack the wounded gnoll, my ghoul attacks the other unparalysed gnoll. I get 7 for my elf, and 9, 4, and 14 for my ghoul.<br/>DM: The 14 just barely hits, but (rolls 18) the gnoll isn't paralysed. How much damage?<br/>Elf: 2 points.<br/>DM: He's not dead either. Cleric, roll for the cure light wounds?<br/>Cleric: (Rolls) Fighter 1, you heal 4 hit points.<br/>Fighter 1: So I'm back to 3 hit points, can I get up?<br/>DM: Next round you can stand up as your action.<br/>Fighter 1: Can I attack from the ground?<br/>DM: Sure, but you'll suffer an AC penalty.<br/>Fighter 1: But not an attack penalty?<br/>DM: No.<br/>Fighter 2: That's next round. This round, I attack the first wounded gnoll. I roll 12.<br/>DM: He blocks your blow, snarling at you. Their turn to go (rolls to see who they attack). The wounded one attacks Fighter 2, the other one runs for the door, opens it, and leaves the room. Fighter 2, you take 4 points of damage.<br/>Fighter 2: That's okay, I still have 21 hit points left.<br/>DM: Next round, roll for initiative. Anyone casting a spell?<br/>Elf: Can I still see the gnoll outside the room?<br/>DM: Yes you can see him down the hall.<br/>Elf: I cast magic missile at him. I'll roll for initiative. Crap, a 1.<br/>DM: (Rolls 5 for the monsters.) They go first. The wounded gnoll attacks the elf. It's a hit, for 6 points of damage, and the spell is lost. You can't cast it again.<br/>Elf: Damn. Can my ghoul attack now?<br/>DM: Sure.<br/>Elf: 16, 15, and 11.<br/>DM: Two hits.<br/>Elf: 1 and 3 points of damage, 4 total.<br/>DM: He's not dead, and (rolls 19) he makes his saving throw, so he's not paralysed.<br/>Fighter 1: I attack him from the ground. I roll 17, for 8 points of damage.<br/>DM: You kill him! The first blow chops off a foot, he falls, you stab him in the face.<br/>Fighter 2: One dead, one paralysed, one out of the room, right? I run out and down the hall.<br/>Cleric: Yeah, me too!<br/>DM: Okay, you get out and you can see that the gnoll has found reinforcements. He's got five more gnolls and what looks like a raptor, except bigger (shows picture).<br/>Cleric: Whoa, back up!<br/>Fighter 2: I turn around and run back into the room as soon as I see it!<br/>DM: Okay.<br/>Fighter 2: Daily dino guys, lets go!<br/>Elf: I run over to the lever so I can shut the secret door as soon as we're out.<br/>DM: You already acted this round.

Sometimes all the GM's NPCs will act on the same initiative number, sometime they all roll separately. From highest to lowest, every character gets their turn. You can hold your action if you want your character to wait until another character has acted. Interestingly, holding an action is not something anyone ever says or does in the other two groups.<br/><br/><b>Example:</b><br/>GM: The pirates grab their weapons when they see you coming. Roll for initiative. Anybody get 10 or higher?<br/>Ambassador: I got 10.<br/>Dolphin: I got 11.<br/>GM: Okay, the Dolphin goes first. What do you do?<br/>Dolphin: I've got my servo-arm hand on the detonator button, but I hold my action.<br/>GM: Alright then, Ambassador?<br/>Ambassador: I shoot the captain with my gauss rifle. Three shots, I roll 8, 9, 13.<br/>GM: Okay, so his armour is actually really high tech level and your gauss needles don't penetrate, which means he takes 3 damage total.<br/>Ambassador: What? Dammit!<br/>GM: Nobody's on 9, right? Alien's on 8?<br/>Alien Journalist: Yeah, I rolled 8. Since I have a gauss rifle, too, I don't shoot the captain. Do I see the pilot?<br/>GM: You see the one guy you saw piloting their ship before. They might have multiple pilots, though.<br/>Alien Journalist: Well, I'll shoot that guy then, three shots. I roll 11, 10, and 7. So, two hits.<br/>GM: So two hits at 100% damage, roll for both.<br/>Alien Journalist: 9 and 17, so 26 total.<br/>GM: Wow, so that guy's out of it. Baron, you're on 7.<br/>Baron: Yeah, but maybe the Dolphin wants to detonate the explosive now? We only want to capture the captain, and his armour probably means he will survive, yeah? Otherwise I shoot him with the laser, and that might kill him too.<br/>Dolphin: Yeah! I blow them up!<br/>GM: Okay, so the charges you set here (points to the map) explode, and pretty much all of the pirates except these two at the far end of the hangar bay get caught in the blast\u2026 (after a bunch of rolls) \u2026the two pirates act on 7, simultaneous with the Baron, and the flee for cover.<br/>Baron: Whatever, I let them go, I send my drone over to the captain and pick him up.<br/>GM: It seems like he's still able to move, maybe he just blacked out for a second.<br/>Baron: Uh oh.<br/>GM: Okay, new round! Dolphin, you're up.<br/>Dolphin: I get back in the shuttle!<br/>Ambassador: On my turn I run over to the Baron's drone and stab the captain with a tranquilizer.<br/>GM: Okay, I take it everyone is running back to the shuttle?<br/>Alien Journalist: Well, I get some video of the whole scene at the same time.<br/><b>Etc.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433580/#Comment_433580" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-09T07:56:10+00:00" title="June  9, 2014  7:56AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2014 5:38AM by Johnstone.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Story Games fight scene procedures:</b><br/><br/>First the GM describes the situation and what is happening, including what all the NPCs are trying to accomplish, which usually means who they are attacking. Consequences of these actions\u2014at least as they pertain to PCs\u2014do not yet apply and are not usually described.<br/><br/>Second, each of the players who have characters involved in the situation described get a chance to act or react. If their PC does something that does not require a roll (ie is not a \u201cmove\u201d), either the player or the GM (or both) describes the results. If the PC does something that requires a roll (ie is a \u201cmove\u201d), each of the players who have characters making moves rolls in whatever order makes the most sense to everyone at the table. Depending on the roll, the player or the GM describes the results of the action and how \u201csuccessful\u201d it is, plus the GM may or may not offer the player a choice of consequences, and if the roll is poor, the GM will apply consequences immediately, which may include resolving actions that NPCs are undertaking, especially if they are trying to harm the PC.<br/><br/>Once all involved players have had a chance to act or react and their rolls have been resolved, the GM describes the results of any NPC actions that were not hindered or that have not already happened as the result of a poor roll. Consequences are applied as the results demand.<br/><br/><b>Example:</b><br/>(<i>This example is from Dungeon World, since we haven't actually had a fight in the Traveller game yet. The PCs keep refusing to get into fights and keep managing to escape when a fight comes to them. But it would be a lot like this if it happened, only with guns, probably.</i>)<br/>The wizard and the fighter find a magical idol in the goblin warrens, but then four goblins burst in.<br/>GM: They usually travel in larger packs, but since they have a sorceress with them, they charge you, brandishing their swords and spears. The sorceress waves her hands and chants in the Black Tongue.<br/>Wizard: I grab the idol and stuff it into my backpack.<br/>Fighter: I ready my sword and shield and block the goblins. They won't hurt my wizard!<br/>GM: Okay, Wizard, the idol is heavy, but seems like it will just fit into your bag. Fighter, you're defending her, so roll for that.<br/>Fighter: 5 and 4, with +1 for CON is 10. I hold three.<br/>GM: Okay, so they crash down upon you, and you take 1d6 damage, plus 2 for the extra two goblins in the attack.<br/>Fighter: Whoa, there hoss! I spend a hold and stab the first one in the face for 4 damage.<br/>GM: Sure! He has 3 HP and 1 Armour, so you take him down before he can strike, but the other two press on, so you take 1d6+1 damage, so (rolls) 6 points, minus your armour.<br/>Fighter: I spend my second hold to halve that damage, so it's 3 points minus my armour, so I take no damage at all.<br/>GM: The goblin spears strike only the metal of your armour and the wood of your shield. Good job! Sadly, though, the sorceress has finished chanting, and fire spills from her hands, flying across the room, engulfing the Wizard! You can feel the mystical fire burning your flesh, muahahaha, and you take (rolls) 12 points of damage! And you are on fire!<br/>Fighter: Excuse me?! Over my dead body, I'm standing in front of her! I spend my third hold and redirect the attack to me.<br/>GM: Oh. Well, alright, then. You're the one on fire. Wizard, you're fine.<br/>Wizard: Cool, I flee out the back door with the idol.<br/>Fighter: Whaaat?! Traitor!<br/>Wizard: Hey, I'm not the Cleric. I'll tell him you need help if I see him.<br/>GM: Okay, meanwhile in the other room, at the exact same time all that is happening, Cleric and Bard, what are you doing?<br/>Bard: You said there was a face carved into the wall? I push on it.<br/>Cleric: No! I stop her! I grab her hands!<br/>Bard: Whatever, you can't stop me! I push him out of the way, he's shorter than me!<br/>GM: Okay, Cleric, maybe you should defy the danger of the Bard pushing you around. With STR I guess. Bard, you can roll to interfere I guess.<br/>Cleric: I rolled a 6, with +1 from STR, so 7. That's basically a success, right?<br/>Bard: But I rolled 11 to interfere! Take that! And a -2, so you fail, hahaha!<br/>GM: Yeah, she pushes you and you fall over. Bard, when you push on the face, it sinks into the wall and the ceiling starts lowering, all on its own.<br/>Cleric: I told you not to touch anything!<br/>Bard: Oops.<br/>GM: Wizard, this is when you enter the room.

Killin' dudes, maybe? I dunno that I have a real specific answer, but...<br/><br/>Combat is one of the main things we do in old school D&amp;D, and with a lot of swing-and-a-misses, it can take a while to get through. Even so it can also get pretty nailbiting sometimes, where we're a hair's breadth away from a TPK, we have no idea what is coming, the DM's music selection randomly switches to The Fog soundtrack, and we're all on the edge of our seats.<br/><br/>In the trad group, we're usually fighting people (NPCs) that have been a real pain in the ass to us over multiple sessions, so yeah, killin' dudes can be pretty satisfying, even if interacting with the rules usually isn't.<br/><br/>When we use Apocalypse World, or Ghost/Echo, or Danger Patrol, or something, with the story games group, combat is more about the fiction that it is about playing a skirmish wargame, and yet tactical positioning can totally be an important thing. And things go much faster.<br/>\n<blockquote>How do they compare in time to resolve a similarly complex and dangerous fight?</blockquote>\nStory games group uses rules that are by far the fastest, unless maybe we play Burning Wheel. Way faster than the trad group.<br/><br/>Old school can be a bit swingy, depending on the dice and fast decision-making, and if we run away or not. Sometimes a combat can take a really, really long time, and sometimes it is even as fast as the story games group would be.<br/><br/>But I guess if we had a situation as similar as possible in all three groups, story games would be the fastest, trad in the middle, and old school the slowest (unless we were all first level characters, and then old school could be the fastest, even if you count rolling up new characters).<br/><br/>The trad group usually does way more planning if we know we're having a fight though. I think this is partially because we are using rules often just as deadly as old school D&amp;D, but we don't know our characters' capabilities as well as the old school players all know D&amp;D, and the same can be said about the capabilities of the opposition and the possibilities of the fiction. We usually know what kind of risks we are taking in D&amp;D, in the trad games, unless we are playing Call of Cthulhu, I usually can't gauge capability and danger.<br/>\n<blockquote>In which group are you most likely to genuinely care about the tactical situation?</blockquote>\nWe use maps in all three. I'd say I would feel the most comfortable being creative about the tactical situation with the story games group, just because we're not tied down by any of the skirmish wargames rules. It feels like characters in these games have more options, generally.<br/><br/>Occasionally D&amp;D combats will basically be a skirmish wargame, and positioning counts, but the environment mostly doesn't. I don't care for any of the rules systems the trad group uses, really, and combat is where the rules are most intrusive, but at the same time, we're usually still looking at a map of the scene and planning our actions based on the environment.<br/><br/>However, one big difference that sets old school apart is motivation. Usually story games fights are interesting because of why they happen, even in Dungeon World, were not usually just trying to kill someone. In the trad group, even though we often fight because we're just sick of someone screwing with us and we've decided they need to die, we had one fight recently where we ambushed some space pirates but our main goal was to rescue a couple prisoners who were wearing explosive slave collars. And our biggest and longest fight was in order to rescue a PC.<br/><br/>In the old school group, almost always we fight for one of two reasons:<br/>a) Violent monsters roam the wilderness (and so do we), or<br/>b) We kill people and take their treasure.<br/><br/>Actually, another thing that is different about old school is the healing spells. There's the helping rules in AW, but otherwise there isn't a lot of stuff that promotes teamwork between characters who do different things and don't all deal damage, to be honest. The feeling of front-line combat characters and rear support staff, whether wizard-cannons or cleric-healers, is mostly an old school thing. It can happen in Dungeon World, actually, but hasn't been a thing in the games I've played.<br/>\n<blockquote>And in which group are you more likely to be genuinely excited about the ups and downs of the fight as they roll in?</blockquote>\nAs a player?
