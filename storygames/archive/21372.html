Thinking of a good example, I'll suggest <i>Exalted</i>: I think it's a compelling setting, and arguably there are source books more and less dense in interesting setting prose, but ultimately the Exalted books I've read have been merely mediocre as reading experiences. This probably has to do with an excessive amount of nitpicky mechanical crunch, the sheer length of the supplement treadmill (which forces them to parcel out the material), plus the flatness of the presentation (too much gazetteer, not enough campaign framework, which is of course arguably a virtue for actual gaming use), or something like that.<br/><br/>I'll list a couple of examples of what I personally consider to be rpg texts with high literary quality. You probably have your own ways of evaluating an aesthetic question like this, but my benchmark is simply whether the book stands up as a relevant work when stacked next to other literature in its genre. In other words, it needs to be good enough to read even if you don't actually plan to play it.<br/><br/><b>Glorantha</b> materials occasionally surpass my benchmark. The <i>King of Sartar</i> setting history slash fantasy novel ranks particularly high to my mind, it's a delightful and relevant read for anybody interested in good fantasy literature (of a particular Tolkienist sort, perhaps, but still). Actual setting sourcebooks are also regular good reads; the less mechanics the better, generally speaking.<br/><br/>The aforementioned <b>Delta Green</b> essentially builds its line profile on this stuff: the books are nothing but exquisitely detailed conspiracy horror scenarios of the highest caliber. The rpg sourcebook format (consisting of setting exposition and adventure scenarios) actually works pretty well for this sort of literary material compared to your typical novel structure with its plots and explicitly arranged drama and such. The information density alone is to be commended, not to speak of the degree of realistic detail; such features make for something that far surpasses say <i>X-Files</i> or <i>Atrocity Archives</i> or other works of the genre in quality.<br/><br/><b>Pendragon</b>, and particularly the <i>Great Pendragon Campaign</i>, are an interesting and rewarding read for anybody interested in historical, mythical fantasy. Few Arthurian fantasies are as detailed, self-consistent and literarily ambitious. The fact that the material is constantly pressured by gaming needs to have a popular slant and multiple stylistic possibilities only adds to the cleverness and kaleidoscopic tapestry. Arthurian fantasy is usually written in a very dramatically focused way, putting important characters in the forefront, and usually over-emphasizing Mallory and a few other sources; not so in this masterpiece.<br/><br/>Other games that feature something resembling this level of quality in at least some of their material include the likes of <i>JAGS Wonderland</i>, <i>Cyberpunk 2020</i>, <i>2300 AD</i>, <i>Ars Magica</i>, <i>Polaris</i> (hey, they don't all need to be long works)... there's probably quite a few games that I'm not thinking of right now. Obviously a remarkably high level of literary quality isn't the most common thing (wouldn't be remarkable if it was), but I find it highly likely that there are games that I'm not thinking of, or even ones that I haven't ever read.<br/><br/>So, can you point me towards any new candidates for my discerning list of remarkable literature in rpgs?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467748/#Comment_467748" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-17T00:19:52+00:00" title="November 17, 2017 12:19AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2017 12:20AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited November 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have yet to read it\u2014so I can\u2019t speak to its quality as literature\u2014but <b>The Drifter\u2019s Escape</b> might qualify.

Keep the suggestions coming, I'll throw them in the ol' culture mill.<br/><br/>One more example occurred to me just now: <i>Unknown Armies</i> has some pretty sweet feverish urban fantasy stylings going for it at its best. I don't like it quite as much as I like some more grim urban fantasy/horror titles (such as the aforementioned <i>Delta Green</i>), as it gets a bit cheesy and toothless in its cosmological bits, but the street level stuff - Dipsomancers and fast food conspiracies - is fun.<br/><br/>And I guess I'll need to mention <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i>, <i>Urchin</i>, <i>Scorn</i> and <i>Acts of Evil</i>, too, if I'm listing legit horror fantasy rpgs with good, explicit setting work. Most are on the short side as literary works, but what they've got definitely has its high points. I especially recommend <i>Don't Lose Your Mind</i>, Benjamin Baugh's sourcebook for DRYH as a tour de force into absurd psychological horror; in many ways it's a perfect example of what one of these traditional "rpg writer as an author of your dreams" types puts together when let loose.<br/><br/><i>Drifter's Escape</i> is a sweet book and a very exciting game; the stories are by Ben's brother Jake, and I remember finding them pleasantly exotic in the way Americana tends to be. A very literary game book, and an appropriate call-out here. Ben's one of my all-time favourite designers specifically because we share a love of literature.<br/><br/>I haven't read <i>Archipelago</i> (yes, that is strange), but perhaps I should, although I'm not necessarily looking for rules texts written in flavourful ways so much as good world-building prose or plot or such.<br/><br/><i>Itras By</i> is, indeed, another good example of a game with literary dimension; I do not truly appreciate the artificial obscurity in how it explains its setting (<i>Polaris</i> does the absurd fantasy setting thing with more grace), but the actual content is cool through and through.<br/><br/>And yes, I am aware of <i>Prince of Sartar</i>. It is to be recommended to both new-comers and old Glorantha fans; even if it does drag a bit in storytelling terms at times, it makes up for it with the careful visual work on complex concepts. I'll be glad when the current cradle-robbing arc is finally finished, the extended action sequence makes the comic feel like it doesn't progress at all [grin].<br/><br/>So yeah, I second many of these suggestions. Now, give me something I don't know yet. The boundless maw requires new experiences and strange passions to consume, and right now it's hungry for something with distinctly non-dramatic slant, such as rpg setting books. It is a great joy on occasion to read something that simply tells you about a strange world without having to be force-fed a whitebread protagonist viewpoint on the side. Too much carb in that, I need fat to survive the winter months.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti" title="lorenzogatti"><img alt="lorenzogatti" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti">lorenzogatti</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467762/#Comment_467762" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-17T11:39:33+00:00" title="November 17, 2017 11:39AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You mention <i>Cyberpunk 2020</i>.

I'm thinking of the pre-release playtest version, now, which was my first encounter with it. I remember approaching it skeptically because of a bit of a shallow prejudice of mine against post-apocalyptica, then being totally won over by the imaginative language way before I had wrapped my head around the playstyle and mechanics.<br/><i>In a Wicked Age...</i> and <i>Poison'd</i> are, in my opinion, sweet texts: short, to the point, full of flavor. <i>Midsummer Wood</i> is like that, and perhaps better. I also love the various clever bits of swords &amp; sorcery, planetary romance or plain weird fantasy flavor found throughout Vincent's <i>The Seclusium of Orphone</i> and the <i>Freebooting Venus</i> and <i>Rock of Tahamaat</i> drafts.<br/><br/>Moving on to works by other people, I remember having a great time reading <i>A Taste for Murder</i> by Graham Walmsley, and especially its extensive historical appendix.<br/>Speaking of good non-fiction literature in role-playing books, <i>Spione</i> and <i>Shahida</i> by Ron Edwards are excellent reads, both evocative and provocative.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467794/#Comment_467794" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-18T01:19:36+00:00" title="November 18, 2017  1:19AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, Eero! Looks like I was replying to the thread title more than to your actual request... Most (though not all) of your examples would end up into my TL;DR bin if I tried reading them these days! Just yesterday, for example, I was lamenting to the friend who'd given it to me to read that the main flaw I could find in <i>Blades in the Dark</i> is it's too setting-intensive: while the actually actionable setting material is presented in a very usable form, it does contain more "weird overall world stuff" players are supposed to know upfront than I can convey in a 5-minute speech -- which has always been a huge playability hurdle in my general experience.<br/><br/>What about <i>Shock: Human Contact</i>? It's one of those settings I found enticing upon reading, but I had to give up playing because my attempt to info-dump it onto other people backfired forever.<br/><br/>Or, are you familiar with Jeff Himmelman's <i>Kingdom of Nothing</i>? I remember it as a great game - much more intriguing than DRYH, to mention something sort-of similar - but also as a book I gave up reading because it front-loaded too much setting info. Might be your cup of tea, though. Another book I ended up not reading, for the same reason, is <i>Hot War</i>.<br/><br/>Which makes me realize... I can power through any amount of setting material in a RPG manual - be it sharp or dull - as long as it comes after some moderately grabby instructions for playing to wet my interest, but not the other way around. <i>Blades in the Dark</i> was OK for me because most of that stuff was at the end of the book - it leads with the actual <i>game</i>. If you put setting stuff before anything else in your RPG book, it has either to be <i>really good</i>, <i>really</i> well-written setting material (like, <i>Polaris</i> level of good!) or you'll lose me. Almanacs of fictional characters, places, etc. are better confined to appendixes, as far as I'm concerned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467798/#Comment_467798" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-18T08:41:35+00:00" title="November 18, 2017  8:41AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Or, are you familiar with Jeff Himmelman's Kingdom of Nothing?

My own experience is that generally speaking the greatest literary feats in the rpg field have been attempted in trad games. You can see the summation of my own experiences in the games I've mentioned; even as my actual favourite rpgs tend to be progressive works from the last 15 years, I haven't usually experienced them as excellent prose fiction myself. Clearly shows which forum we're posting on [grin].<br/><br/>(There are of course exceptions, of which Rafu listed many - I largely agree with him about which Forgite classics make for good reads. Still, being good reading fiction isn't the goal for the technically progressive modern rpg in the way it is for a traditional supplement treadmill title.)<br/><br/>For my own purposes, honorary mentions go to <i>Cybergenerations</i> (I've heard others commend it, too), <i>Veins of the Earth</i> (a good point, I know it's going to be good, haven't yet gotten around to reading it), Rickard's European titles that I haven't even heard of, <i>Parapet Papers</i> (the concept sounds like it might succeed in being literature) and <i>Swashbucklers of the Seven Skies</i> (a title I'm only vaguely aware of existing) and <i>Shock: Human Contact</i> (haven't read that despite being quite familiar with the actual game).<br/><br/>Another relevant title occurs to me, one that hasn't been mentioned yet: the <i>Amber</i> rpg is a very worthwhile companion work to the novel(s) it's based on. It has the same sort of "densely literate" texture that I appreciate in e.g. Pendragon, as it embraces its source work thoroughly and enhances the reader's understanding of the corpus. It's taken me a long time to start appreciating the Chronicles of Amber as fantasy literature (I first needed to realize that <i>Day of the Jackal</i> is a great thriller, basically), but now that I have, I'm also much more appreciative of the rpg text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467804/#Comment_467804" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-18T14:44:39+00:00" title="November 18, 2017  2:44PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mispent Youth, eyebleed edition, really is stylish. <br/><br/>Shadowrun Street Samurai catalog is a piece of postmodern literature.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467805/#Comment_467805" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-18T14:48:04+00:00" title="November 18, 2017  2:48PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Shadowrun Street Samurai catalog is a piece of postmodern literature.</p></div></blockquote>\nHow about <i>Shadowrun</i> in general?

The order the rules are introduced is somewhat (very loosely) based on the encapsulating fiction. The fiction itself is exemplary of the sort of things a player-character may expect to experience.<br/><br/>As a fantasy story, it's an enjoyable read, and well-written as far as I can tell -- despite the burden of having to describe a setting for play (if it fails somewhere, it's in occasionally being opaque as a setting sourcebook, not in being a dull read). I'd characterize it as contemporary "weird" swords &amp; sorcery with a bit of a SF bent, not unlike what I would expect from Worlds Without Master. I understand it was Paul's goal for it to have literary quality, and I believe he succeeded.<br/><br/>My only two complaints - not relevant here - are that the structure of the book makes it hard to use as a reference (but then, all RPG manuals have to make a choice anyway between being teaching texts or reference texts first, or some kind of compromise) and (my standard boilerplate complaint) that complex, imaginative settings like this tend to require a majority of players who've actually read the book to successfully translate to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467830/#Comment_467830" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-19T04:53:28+00:00" title="November 19, 2017  4:53AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2017 4:54AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited November 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool, Rafu!<br/><br/>Eero, based on Rafu\u2019s description above, it sounds like <b>The Clay That Woke</b> may be a good option for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467840/#Comment_467840" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-19T13:48:17+00:00" title="November 19, 2017  1:48PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So it does.

What they did is take a bunch of iconic D&amp;D monsters, such as the Beholder, Hags, Gnolls, etc, and then did a deep dive on them one at a time. They present their history, culture, ecology, religion, allies, enemies, motivations, and often a sample map lair.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in the margins, you get Volo and Elminster sniping at each other and telling each other they're wrong about key details. This is not only amusing, but has an obvious meta-textual benefit: making clear to GMs that the information presented in this chapter is not "canon" in any definite sense, but merely meant as a jumping-off point for your own creativity.<br/><br/>But the idea of basing a campaign around a single monstrous group / organization and its minions, affiliates, etc., is also a really cool idea that this book helps support, without the outright or quasi railroading of hardback adventures.

Not that I don't appreciate poetry as an art form, but I'm not primarily on the look-out for rpg books that happen to have the odd moment of poetry in them.<br/><br/>In case you're wondering, there is potential for gaming application in this canvassing for literarily readable games.

I've spent a lot of enjoyable hours over the years reading both rules-texts and RPG "fluff" texts (I also enjoy reading encyclopedias and essays, however, and "real world" source material often happens to be more surprising than purpose-made RPG sourcebooks).<br/>My objection to long-winded setting books (well, to anything going longer than a couple pages, really) is entirely practical: either <i>everyone</i> at the table has read it, or what actual use is it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468017/#Comment_468017" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-26T20:37:38+00:00" title="November 26, 2017  8:37PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I've noticed the general gist of it. I've been entertaining a theory about that- I've become an old coot without noticing it, and the traditional gaming scene from whence this sort of stuff mostly blossoms is actually ancient history for most people here [grin].<br/><br/>If this is the case for you, dear reader, I suggest taking a look at some of the games mentioned in favourable light here. Yes, they're traditional (with all the baggage that implies), but occasionally they're actually very legit on axes other than strict playability. Setting stuff, for instance, is transferable, and there's no particular reason why one couldn't use say the painstakingly produced future history, star maps and alien culture write-ups of <i>2300 AD</i> in a more approachable game.<br/><br/>But that, of course, presumes that you find something that's good enough to use. This is a high threshold if you're worth shit as a gamer and author yourself, as the stuff needs to be better than you can be bothered to whip up yourself, and in some way relevant even when put next to all the other sources you could be tapping just as well. Most rpgs tend to fall slightly short of the goal. I could make long, long lists of games that have sort of nice fluff, but not quite good enough for me to really care about using it. The '90s produced a lot of these, from <i>Deadlands</i> to <i>Earthdawn</i> to most Whitewolf games: lots of fluff, hundreds upon hundreds of pages per gameline, and mostly it's sort of good enough that I can see how it would be compelling for its creator, but not quite there for the end-user like me, who only cares about the very top of the pyramid.<br/><br/>A random though: has anybody read any Palladium stuff recently (or at all)? Is it any good in terms of setting-building? I've read like the core <i>Rifts</i> book years ago, maybe, and I've occasionally heard some wacky details about the setting, but I've never read any setting books for the game. I understand that quite a few exist, so it qualifies as a major game line in terms of text bulk, at least. Geeky schlock or wild underground fantasy extravaganza?

Alignment with "native" GURPS supplements like <i>Blood Types</i> and <i>Cabal </i> is an added bonus.<br/><br/>Other adaptations of existing games, like <i>Castle Falkenstein</i>, tend to miss the point a little, while original GURPS-based franchise adaptations tend to be an easy job given the available tools (e.g. <i>The Prisoner</i>, <i>Prime Directive</i>), or good thanks to standard GURPS encyclopedic treatment (e.g. <i>Discworld</i>), or good thanks to special rules (e.g. <i>Goblins</i>).   <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468205/#Comment_468205" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-05T02:15:21+00:00" title="December  5, 2017  2:15AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>This may be a slightly different angle on this whole thing, but I remember an oddball game from roughly 2005 called "untitled".</p></div></blockquote>\nThis sounds fascinating and I'd love to read it, but it's got a very SEO-unfriendly name, i.e. a quick search for "untitled rpg" turned up a bunch of stuff, including at least two games called "Untitled", but nothing like what you're recalling.
