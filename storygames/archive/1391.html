                    Over in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1385" rel="nofollow">Frame my Scene</a>, Eric raised a good point that aggressive scene framing is (almost by definition) going to blow by some scenes that <i>could</i> be played, but aren't.  The particular issue was that some people responded to <b>"I want to get the Hand of Flame back from the Count. Let's sneak into his castle!"</b> by skipping the "sneaking in" and framing directly into the castle, post-sneaking.<br/><br/>So, yes, aggressive scene framing is always going to be as much about what you skip as it is about what you frame to.  It is saying "<i>This</i> is important," in a way that inherently implies "<i>That other stuff</i>?  Not so much."  It's good for people to be on roughly the same page about this.<br/><br/>So in the worst-case scenario where, actually, the player values the sneaking and doesn't care about the activity inside the castle, you've miscued and screwed up.<br/><br/>And, likewise, in the best-case scenario where the player values the confrontation inside the castle and doesn't care about the sneaking except inasmuch as it gets her there, you've correctly cued and done a great job.<br/><br/>I would argue (and I know that this may, in fact, become an argument and I'm fine with that) that in the wierd-case scenario where the players values <b>both</b> in equal proportion, it's impossible to go wrong.<br/><br/>If you give them the sneaking, and then give them the confrontation, they're happy campers.  You've given them two scenes that were exciting!<br/><br/>If you give them just the confrontation ... well, what's your next scene?  If we assume that it's going to be lame then you've blown it, but why assume that your next scene will be lame?  If you give them the awesome confrontation scene, and then frame directly to the awesome dungeon-escape scene then you have (again) given them two scenes that were exciting.  My experience is that players are, generally speaking, totally okay with that.<br/><br/>The arguments against skipping a valuable scene in order to present a different valuable scene seem (to me) to be as follows (1) an argument from scarce resources ... we haven't <b>got</b> that many valuable scenes and (2) an argument from structure ... that sneaking scene establishes something specific that we can build on, which is missed in the later scenes.<br/><br/>I think <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is extremely dicey.  <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is more plausible, but I refuse to believe that <i>every</i> scene that the players would enjoy is a structural scene.  Sometimes they just want to do something trivial and fun, and while it's totally cool to do it, it's totally cool to skip it too.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>

                            My position is that, using just the goal/request, that skipping over the sneaking and going onto another conflict about getting the item means that you're missing an important flag.  I'm of the opinion that framing right to the sneaking part *is* aggressively framing the scene.  It's getting to what the player just said that they wanted.
<blockquote><cite>Tony</cite>I would argue (and I know that this may, in fact, become an argument and I'm fine with that) that in the wierd-case scenario where the players values both in equal proportion, it's impossible to go wrong.</blockquote>
Wow.  I so disagree with that.  It's so easy to go wrong here.  If the player wants both equally, then failing to hit either one means that you've gone wrong, doesn't it?  <br/><br/>I don't support either of your arguments about skipping a valuable scene.  I see it as the player saying "Hey, I wanna be sneaky!"  And if you don't give them sneaky, then does the awesomness of the scenes they get instead make up for that?                        </div>

<p>Well, if I want Sneaking and a Gunfight, then that's different than wanting Sneaking and/or a Gunfight.  In the latter case I'll be satisfied with either one.  In the former I need both to be satisfied.  So, if a player tells a GM that they want the Doohickey and they want to Sneak there to do it, then the GM would have to give that player a sneaky scene and a doohickey-grabbing scene to satisfy them.</p>

                            In my example, I asked, okay, what do you want to use to get in?<br/><br/>That's important, it let's the player know that I don't think he should just waltz on in, it allows the player to find a hand-hold with the castle and let's me know what they find exciting.  I inserted flags to make the post make more sense to me and make it easier.  The flags were the sneak skill bought up to the highest possible levels and the noble-lady.<br/><br/>So, from that, i know they want to sneak.<br/><br/>If they have the Key of Contacts (TSoY) or really high Circles (BW) or an Edge who is a mercenary (PTA) we could riff off of that.<br/><br/>And, we could absolutely skip to them in the room with the hand of flame, conversing with this infernal item that is beckoning them to cut off their own hand and light the world afire.  Absolutely.  If they had a flag on their sheet about the Hand of Flame specifically and I knew that is where the kewl was, I'd go right for it.<br/><br/>Honestly, I didn't feel like we had enough.  We didn't have character sheets, body language or contect and all of that is so important for scene framing, vital even.<br/><br/>Um, does this belong in this thread or the original?<br/><br/>I dunno.<br/><br/>To get to Tony's point, I think missing opportunities at times is a fact of life in gaming.  I find myself doing it all of the time but most of all when I take a months/years long break and find myself back in the saddle.  That first session back is always chock full of times when I felt I missed an opportunity to frame a cool scene.                        </div>

So, what if we're playing a game without character sheets or flags.  In the first scene.  Over IM.  You don't think you can frame a scene for someone who declares a goal?  Granted, it's way easier with sheets, flags, context, and body language, but I can't agree that any of those things are vital for scene framing, aggressive or otherwise.                        </div>

                            This is a related comment, really:<br/>
<br/>
I ignore damn near everything that the designer thinks is cool about their game, and often strip it out and replace it with something else.<br/>
<br/>
This really is connected to TonyLB's question.  Actually I think this is an answer to his question just given in a different sense. This isn't a question of GM players and character players, because the only conceivable answer to give to that is "well, let's figure out what we like and do that" and that doesn't get us anywhere.  This is a question of designers and players.  What should someone thousands of miles away have to say about this question?<br/>
<br/>
And for me, the answer is, not much.                        </div>

                            Couple thoughts.<br/><br/>First of all, nobody is going to want <em>just</em> Sneaking and a Gunfight.  Any given player is going to have a whole lot more things they're interested in.  Which is what Tony's trying to get at.  If the player wants Sneaking, a Gunfight, a Court Scene, Wilderness Survival, and Naval Combat, is there any difference between a set of scenes including Sneaking, Gunfight, and Wilderness Survival and another set that includes Gunfight, Wilderness Survival, Naval Combat?  As long as you are consistently hitting flags, does it matter that you could have hit a flag but you passed it up in favor of hitting some <em>other</em> flag?  To complicate matters, what happens if the other characters aren't too interested in a Sneaky scene, but this one guy is?  Is it okay then to skip over the group-sneaky scene and plan to have a solo-sneaky scene to scratch his itch?<br/><br/>Secondly, this is why I'm increasingly disinterested in flagless games.  I look at a character sheet of Random Game X and the first thing I look for is "where do I indicate what I care about?"  Can you get flags outside the character sheet?  Sure, but why should the GM or other players maintain some secondary sheet listing off what everyone is interested in?  Especially since, when you get down to it, that second flag-sheet is actually more important than the character sheet.<br/><br/>Thirdly, as for what <em>I</em> ignore in a game?  Seriously, depends on the game.  If we're playing ninjas, I want the Sneaky scene. If we're playing cowboys, I want the Gunfight scene.  And so on.  What is and is not important is hugely contextual, depending not only on the players but which gamebook they're playing out of and the individual game that they are playing.                        </div>

<p><strong>Judd:</strong>  You totally did frame that scene.  So, then we're in agreement that external flags aren't vital scene framing.  At the same time I'll agree if you say that these things are vital to <em>awesome</em> scene framing.</p>
<p><strong>Josua BR, Tony, and everyone:</strong>  I dig and agree with pretty much everything you guys are saying.  More flags = more awesome framing.  A missed flag does not mean that the GM should be stabbed in the eye.</p>
<p>Three questions, in multiple parts:</p>
<p>Is <em>"Let's sneak into his castle!"</em> a flag that says something about the player wanting a sneaky scene?  One that the GM can use to immediately increase the level of awesome.</p>
<p>If not, why not?</p>
<p>If so, then doesn't the GM have the responsibility to fulfill that desire?  Or is it ok for the GM to ignore it because he or she feels that their idea is more awesome?</p>
<p>If your answer to the third question is something like  <em>"Yeah, but the sneaky scene doesn't have to happen right away."</em>  then I totally agree.</p>

                            Firstly, what John said?  Totally the most important and obvious and most often ignored answer to the problem.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric Provost</cite>Is<em>"Let's sneak into his castle!"</em>a flag that says something about the player wanting a sneaky scene?  One that the GM can use to immediately increase the level of awesome.</blockquote>
I think "let's sneak into the castle" <em>might</em> be a flag, and it might not, and is therefore kind of dangerous.  It may be a player's goal because he wants inside the castle cause the interesting stuff is in the castle.  He might be interested in the sneaking; he might be interested in the castle.  He might be trying to move the game along.  He might be bored with the current scene.<br/><br/>And, as John points out, all of that ambiguity can be resolved pretty easily by <em>talking to your fellow players</em>.                        </div>

                            Eric, if missing a flag meant a knife in the eye, we'd all be blind.  Yeah, I'm glad you sought out the agreement, it is entirely there and its awesome that you looked for it and found it.  Great.<br/><br/>I think the moment the GM ignores the player's awesome and says in word or deed, "My idea is more awesome," the game falls apaart.<br/><br/>Thy can say tons of things that are cool.<br/><br/>"My idea is awesome and I can tweak their awesome with it."<br/><br/>"Their idea is awesome and it will be even moreso if they have to wait and fight for it more."<br/><br/>"Their idea is awesome, I need to scrap my idea, grab theirs with both hands and run with it."<br/><br/>"Their idea is awesome and they don't even realize that they are setting it up for me; I need to jump on this with both feet."                        </div>

                            Judd, I'm going to go all out of character here and defend the GM.  What happens when the GM has an awesome idea?  Is he just supposed to scrap it if the players have another awesome idea that doesn't work with his idea?

                            Absolutely give and take.<br/><br/>The GM should vomit out awesome ideas.  One of my favorite parts of the text in TSoY is when Clinton writes about the GM putting some things in the game that they think are cool, not just following Keys blindly.<br/><br/>Let's remember that it is a two-way street.  The players input is on their character sheet and through their in-game decisions and the GM should also get some input and have some fun, no doubt.<br/><br/>But, the GM shouldn't throw away a player's idea of awesome and just sub in their own.  They should marry these two bits of awesome together so they compliement each other.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>

                            For me, the "aggression" in "aggressive scene framing" is directed wholly at <i>things which are boring</i>.  Scene framing is a pacing tool, a fastforward button you hit when there's nothing of value involved.<br/><br/>If I think I can make the sneaking interesting, I won't hit the fastforward button.<br/><br/>If the sneaking starts and it's clear it's not interesting, I will.<br/><br/>Etc.                        </div>

Anything I should target, besides just getting the Hand? <br/><br/>MoPlayer: Yea, I want my mom to be there! <br/><br/>BrandGM: Ugh. Um... Okay... <br/><br/>And then I frame the scene. So really, I ignore what the players and my own interests tell me to ignore. I don't know where the idea comes from that a GM must be a solo artist, able to frame up and end-cut scenes all himself when there is a group of smarty people sitting around the table waiting to help.                        </div>

                            I get what you're saying, Brand, but I'm not always feeling like the approach you wrote up (as a skit, as it were) gets me the player-experience that I want: shock, discovery, and surprise.  MoPlayer requested that Mom be there, therefore, no shock, discovery, or surprise that Mom is there.  That takes something from edge-of-seat experience to big yawn territory -- and, yes, that effect occurs due to what you characterize as "so small a change"...<br/><br/>I don't think that you need to play "solo virtuoso" to get the shock, discover, surprise either, but I do think that you can consistently risk turning things into the yawn-factor by taking <i>too much</i> input about what a scene should be (and at least in <i>my</i> play to date, but probably not yours, the sort of thing you outlined would be too much).  So I think for me the question becomes how to anticipate where the line is in advance of someone crossing it.                        </div>

                            Fred,<br/><br/>This is all true. <br/><br/>It also depends on what I have the mother doing, doesn't it? Because MoPlayer wanting her mom to be there just means her mom is there. <br/><br/>It doesn't mean there is less shock when she sneaks in and finds her mom fucking the Count.*<br/><br/>It all depends on where you are going to get your shock from, don't ya know. The line that you have to draw back from totally depends on if your shock comes from what elements are present, or from what the present elements are doing.<br/><br/>*This, btw, isn't rhetorical. We recently did have a scene very much like this in which the big choice was, "Now that I'm here do I steal the dingus or do I keep my mom from going to bed with an abusive ass." No shortage of shock there -- even though more than half the peices had been put on the table by the players.                        </div>

                            Heh.  Good. I thought we were actually living in a much closer cognitive space than the skit suggested.  That's why I was careful to include the phrase "you wrote up", etc.  The skit was shockless, but I suspected there was an unspoken shock to be found in there.  Cool. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I still tend to enjoy the shock coming more from finding that the element is present and doing something, than knowing that the element will be present and instead getting the shock from what the element's doing alone -- but that's much less of a difference in approach.                        </div>

                            Tony, <br/><br/>Okay, something has occured to me as I've been thinking about this. Chracter flags, knowing your players, context of setup and all that crap aside, there is a very important thing that goes on in my brain when I decide what to skip and what to include. Joshua MarxistLenninist brought this up when he talked about the GMs ideas. <br/><br/>I am going to ignore anything that I do not have enough material, ideas, or energy to make rock. <br/><br/>Now, if I know for damn sure the player can do the heavy lifting in a scene, I may let them frame it up as they want and run with that. But when we are talking about me, as GM, having the responsiblity to frame some stuff up by my solo baddass self, then its going to come down to what I can do. <br/><br/>If I can come up with some kick ass shit like John's post about the guard and the glove, then there is no way I'm ignoring the sneaky part. But if the only thing my brain is coming up with for sneaking is, "Um, make a roll to see if you can hide in the shadows" then that is going to vanish from my brain-radar instantly. I'll be skipping right to the part with the count, your characters mom, and the demon -- because I know I can make that awesome. <br/><br/>As a GM part of my job is to play to the players, but part of my job is to play to my own strengths. So, when presented with a situation where I can ignore something weak to focus on something that leaves the player dangling from a cliff by one hand while strangling a giant python with other... can you guess which I'm going to skip?                        </div>

They allow the player to pre-identify interesting things, and the GM can pick those up and run with them as she sees fit.  <br/><br/>Not too shocking that you point out something similar in an effort to fit where my tastes live... since, well.

                            I got into some heavily aggressive scene framing on Sunday. Largely because there's a looming time limit. DitV: I dropped a conflict or interrupted it with another as soon as we were all down to bidding 1s and 2s at each other. This is limp conflict with little contest or excitement. Once we've reached that point, scene over. <br/><br/>The same attitude informs when I start a scene. If the player could waltz through the situation, we talk it out instead of reaching for mechanics. If they ask for it to be played out, I add twists to beef up the opposition and give the challenge some edge. If the player doesn't ask, on we go to a real challenge. Flags, keys, etc. are useful but I think the player should work to advance them with real accomplishments rather than cakewalk encounters that bog down the pacing.                        </div>

Isn't filling in the character sheet all about the flags? Even D&amp;D can serve this purpose.

Sometimes. <br/><br/>Other times its telling the GM "I don't really want to be bothered with having to be sneaky, so I'll take a high score so that I won't have to worry about it game."<br/><br/>And then there are just the times where all its saying is "This is how you make an effective character to confront challanges. I may or may not be actually interested in Stealth challanges, but I know I need a good score in it to be effective in game." <br/><br/>All depends on the game, the player, and all that stuff. Abilities as flags can work, but due to the ambiguities of gaming they aren't always the best type.                        </div>

Eh... not necessarily.  Especially at the beginning of any story, the principals need to show their competencies in some way so that when they use them to resolve the climax it's a matter of reincorporation, and not pulling stuff out of thin air.  That's why a movie or a teevee show might start out with the characters kicking ass -- to establish that they can kick ass for when it's important later.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: thwaak</cite>Isn't filling in the character sheet all about the flags?</blockquote>
You'd think, but no.  There's a discussion to this end somewhere on story-games, but the main thrust boils down to the fact that some characters have stuff on their sheet that the players are not interested in featuring prominently.  If you really <em>don't</em> want to be mind-controlled, for instance, you might buy up Mind Control Resistance so you don't have to deal with it.  If you wanted to contrast incredible competency in one area with incompetency in another -- a swords to plowshares type of thing -- then you'd have the abilities that you <em>didn't</em> want emphasized on your sheet and the abilities that you <em>did</em> want emphasized off the sheet.  Basically, <em>character competency</em> is not always correlated to <em>player interest</em>.<br/><br/>And then there's folks who buy Flaws to get more points to buy more kickass powers.<br/><br/>There are some parts of character sheets that are pure flags -- Kickers, <em>Dogs</em> Relationships, Thematic Batteries in <em>FLFS</em> -- but not all stats are.                        </div>

                            Brent, <br/><br/>Sure, it can be. And the only way to be sure is to actually talk to the other players about what they want out of the game. <br/><br/>Past that, however, having flags that are used primarily to flag, rather than equally to flag and to be game effective, or divisivly to flag, be game effective, and avoid hassels OOCly, reduces the "noise" going on. If you've got something that is a pretty pure "what I want" type stat vs. something that is a "what I can do and maybe what I want" type stat it makes the whole talking thing easier. <br/><br/>Plus, how the stat is explained in the game can make a big difference. Setting up a TSOY Key of My Mother when you don't want your mother to show up in the game is... well... pretty fucktarded. Because you KNOW once you put something down as a Key it is going to come into game as often as possible. That's the whole point, and the text is really up front and center about it. OTOH, a high Melee skill in Exalted could mean... a lot of different things. Putting it way up high because you don't want to get in fights can actually be pretty damn effective. <br/><br/>Flags don't mean the talking goes away. They just make it quicker and easier.                        </div>

                            hallelujah, Brand<br/><br/>This comes around to an experience I had with Okhfels in Mike's IRC Heroquest game.  As a result of a minor encounter, I took the trait "Resists mind control" for Okhfels.  This was because I didn't want Okhfels to be mind-controlled.<br/><br/>What happened?<br/><br/>People looked at my sheet, saw that trait, and said, "Hm, I'll bring mind control into the game.  Clearly, Fred wants Okhfels to resist mind control."  Which was exactly NOT what I wanted, because if you put a character into a situation where he must resist mind control attempts... he's going to fail sometimes.<br/><br/>A little conversation up front would have spared a lot of grief.                        </div>

For what it's worth, <em>FLFS</em>'s Character Histories explicitly says, "Do not write anything here that you do not want in the game.  If you don't want mom showing up in a future situation, don't mention her in your History."<br/><br/>In a related anecdote, I once had a player <em>get mad</em> at me for incorporating one of his character flaws into the game.  Which led to my standard GM warning: "if you put it on the sheet, it's coming up in the game."  Which is now incorporated in <em>FLFS</em>.

                            Wow.  I miss alot when I get a hotel with crappy internet connection.<br/><br/>It occurred to me while I was working yesterday that I'd totally framed that scene with a particular player in mind.  And when I imagined framing a scene for a different player using the same goals I came up with something totally different.  So, here's me smiling and nodding and agreeing with just about everything that's been said in the past day or so.<br/><br/>But here's one thing I think is interesting;
<blockquote><cite>Brand said</cite>If you really don't want to be mind-controlled, for instance, you might buy up Mind Control Resistance so you don't have to deal with it.</blockquote>
<blockquote><cite>... and then, on the same subject, Fred said</cite>A little conversation up front would have spared a lot of grief.</blockquote>
Now, I don't think I've ever played with anyone who's ever put lots of resources into something that they just didn't want to deal with.  So I'm pretty sure that I'd look at anything that a player put into their character as a flag.  I would have made the same mistake that Fred's gamers made about his character.  I'd have pumped-up the mind-controlling characters just because he apparently wanted me to.  <br/><br/>All of which leads me to believe that everything you put on your character sheet is a flag, even if you don't want it to be.  Even if the GM doesn't look at those flags.  If there's something that you just don't want to see happening in the game then you need to be up front about it.  Or maybe play a game that has anti-flags.  <br/><br/>Is there a game that has anti-flags?                        </div>

<p>Yeah.  I think so.</p>
<p>I mean, what's a flag?  It's a way to say <em>Hey, come over here!</em> without actually saying it, right?  Well, if you put up a flag and then get explicit about not going near it, then that doesn't make it any less of a flag.  It just means that you've wasted resources on a flag that no one's going to use.</p>

                            Eric, <br/><br/>Things on your sheet sure can be flags, even when you don't mean them to be. Which is why it is important that everyone in the game be on the same page about what things mean. Which can be done by just having an amazing group, or can be helped along by having a system that is unambigious about what its flags are and how they work. I find that both, together, work out the best.<br/><br/>Also, if you put resources into something to be game effective and get the game effect, but don't get the flag effect then it isn't a waste of resources because that isn't what you were using it for. It's only a waste if you don't get what you wanted out of it, and saying "you wanted game effect and didn't get a flag so it's a failed flag" is a logically flawed argument. Watch this: <br/><br/>Max wants to not be mind controlled <br/>Max buys an ability to not be mind controlled<br/>Max is not mind controlled<br/>Therefore Max's desire to confront mind control has failed. <br/><br/>See how at that last point it all goes haywire?<br/><br/>You make it work only if you add right after the second line: Any ability you take is a challange to the GM. <br/><br/>That works perfectly correctly if you are playing FLFS. Last playtest document I saw Josh had a bit in there about how your abilities are things you want to be challanged on, to push and be pushed around. It does not, however, work if you are playing D&amp;D -- where you often end up with adventures created without any reference to the character sheet.                        </div>

Whoa!  No way.  A flag is a way of saying something <b>by actually saying it!</b>.  That's why it's a flag and not "Guess what number I'm thinking of".  Even when I wrote about how to use games that lack flag mechanics, I back it up by saying, "Talk to your players!" so you can avoid playing psychic mind games.<br/><br/>Otherwise, we're back to square one of trying to guess instead of actually communicate, which is a completely stupid way to play a game based on actual communication between the people playing.                        </div>

Yep. And Max very clearly said the second. Your analogy, otoh, only works (it is a flag and failed as a flag) if it was the first and wasn't used. <br/><br/>Which is why attributes in games that do no SPECIFICALLY say that attributes are flags are really crap to use as flags.                        </div>

                            This is fine with me.  We had a discussion about whether it was okay to ignore scenes that people would see, and it didn't seem to be going anywhere, because people got caught up on "How can you tell?"  So the Flags issue seems a practical, craft-based extension of the original question.<br/><br/>I don't really expect it to come 'round to a conclusion, y'know.  I just expect people to provoke each other to think.  Then a month from now we'll all be saying "Oh, well, <i>of course</i> X, Y and Z.  Everybody knows that."                        </div>

Well, sort of crossing over into the "onexone" discussion, I've played in freeform PBEM games where in-character sex was an expected part of the game, and one of the things on the character sheet was "List things you do NOT want to have your character involved in.  (E.g., rape, bondage with torture, whatever.)"                        </div>

My players make up characters in front of me. I ask them why they made certain decisions about the characters. I take notes. I ask what they want more of in the game. I revise my notes. Before every session I read my notes. I write down some elements to hit this session. I check them off if I hit them. If I don't they stay on the list for next time.<br/><br/>When I blank on things to hit we have another Q and A about where their characters are going.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric Provost</cite>Now, I don't think I've ever played with anyone who's ever put lots of resources into something that they just didn't want to deal with.</blockquote>
Okay, Eric?  Doesn't mean it doesn't happen at other gaming tables. Just sayin. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric Provost</cite>So I'm pretty sure that I'd look at anything that a player put into their character as a flag.  I would have made the same mistake that Fred's gamers made about his character.  I'd have pumped-up the mind-controlling characters just because he apparently wanted me to.<br/><br/>All of which leads me to believe that everything you put on your character sheet is a flag, even if you don't want it to be.  Even if the GM doesn't look at those flags.  If there's something that you just don't want to see happening in the game then you need to be up front about it.</blockquote>
Eric, I think anything on the sheet can be <em>perceived</em> to be a flag by the other players, but that doesn't make it a flag any more than a pilot mistaking a boulevard as a landing strip makes downtown an airport.<br/><br/>A better counter-example for you may be Brand's swords-to-plowshares game where he had a player who wanted this master swordsman coming home to all of the familial problems he left behind.  He took massive levels of Sword Badass because that's what he had gone off to do to avoid his family.  What he was interested in playing was coming back and dealing with those problems, problems that he was not well-equipped to deal with, and contrasting his inexperience and inability with his mastery of the now-useless sword.  In this case, he bought up all those levels of Sword Badass to contrast with the things that he wasn't good at, maybe not even good enough to have them appear on his sheet.<br/><br/>As far as anti-flags go, sure they're out there.  The squick-list from the PBeM game is good; I always start out <em>PTA</em> with "What do we not want to deal with at all?"  In GURPS, there's an advantage called Unfazeable in which you automatically win all Fear checks, thereby removing their efficacy from the game entirely.                        </div>

                            I've always seen them called "limits".  Squick, as a term, is new to me.<br/><br/>But I'm really not sure it's the same thing.  In one case, we're talking about Lines and Veils - stuff people don't want to address because it makes them uncomfortable.  In the other case, we're talking about stuff people don't want to address because it's not interesting to them.  I see a lot of focus on the former in games, but not much on the latter.<br/><br/>I think it'd be cool to have ways to explicitly say stuff like "I don't think it's interesting to check for traps every 10 ft." or "I'm not interested in political maneuvering" as explicitly as you can say that you are interested in those things with many currently available flagging mechanics.  Instincts in BW/E do this to some degree.  But even they don't specifically say, "I'd like you to ignore THIS in favor of other stuff, 'cause I don't find THIS very interesting."<br/><br/>Regards,<br/>Daniel                        </div>

                            The constellation of things I'm simply not interested in (as opposed to actively disinterested) is stupidly large.<br/><br/>"I am not interested in sea turtles killed by red tide."<br/>"I am not interested in the scullery maids' gossip."<br/>"I am not interested in weather patterns."<br/>"I am not interested in kobold culture."<br/>"I am not interested in asian-themed fantasy."<br/>"I am not interested in copper mining."<br/><br/>And in the end, what's the real use in identifying stuff that one player isn't interested in?  It's not like it turns that into forbidden territory; it's just uninteresting territory.  It might be interesting for another player, in which I certainly hope that the uninterested player can let his friend have fun for ten or twenty minutes.  And if the GM is facing down a list of fifteen things that players <em>are</em> interested in, why is he ever going to stray into uninteresting territory?  The players want to go to New York, Boston, Chicago, Providence, and Washington D.C.  Why would the GM take them to Los Angeles?<br/><br/>Now, stuff that players are actively disinterested in to the point that they will have a negative reaction, <em>that's</em> worth flagging.  You can use lines and veils, you can just not go there, you can do that stuff while they're not in the room, whatever.  But that's important information for the GM and the other players to have so that they know that territory is not just uninteresting, it would be a detriment to fun at the table.                        </div>

Dude.  Foul.  No fair taking that paragraph apart.  I know it happens in other groups.  Obviously it happens in other groups, otherwise it wouldn't have been brought up.  I was using that sentence to set up the next one.  The one about the bad assumption I'd make.<br/><br/>Ok, my analogy about wasted resources on a flag sucked.  Big time.  I'll totally cop to that.  In fact, I spent all morning mumbling from that damn foot in my mouth.<br/><br/>I suspect that the source of where we're disagreeing might be in our definitions of flags.  I'd like to be certain we've got that common ground before we keep going, if that's cool.  I was under the assumption that a flag was a way to say "This is important to me." and "Let's have this in the game."  Would that be right?                        </div>

                            Eric, <br/><br/>That wasn't so bad a foot in the mouth. You should see some of the stupid shit I've said in the past. <br/><br/>As for flags, I like Chris Chinn's definition: "Flags are mechanics that the players can use to indicate what they find interesting in the game and what they want the game to be about. Some games make this overt- such as Riddle of Steel, Burning Wheel, Sorcerer, Shadow of Yesterday etc. They put up beliefs, ideals, or conflicts in a big way, saying to the GM, "Hey, do this! Make the game about THIS!" Flags are a way for the player to tell the GM what they think is interesting and important."<br/><br/>The thing I may add to that is that, more and more, I find flags useful only in so much as they are explicit in one way or another. Things that you could possible maybe sometimes squint at and use to get an idea of what the character wants aren't really flags -- they're other things that you're trying to use as a flag because you don't have a proper flag to work from.                        </div>

                            Eric, I'm mostly in agreement with what you've got ("This is important to me / Let's have this in the game") and with what Brand's got, quoting Chris.  The note about explicit flags and making other things flags in the absence of explicit flags is important, too.<br/><br/>As for the quote, it totally sounded like you were saying you hadn't seen it so it didn't exist.  If that wasn't the case, then awesome.  No worries.<br/><br/>(And when did you stop being technocrat13?)                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric Provost</cite>Is there a game that has anti-flags?</blockquote>
Yes: Verge.<br/><br/>Joshua, sure the potential list of anti-flags is huge, but you can anti-flag each other's flags. In Verge, Bob writes down 'Sea Monkeys' and I roll my eyes and stick an X at the end of it, flagging it as bogus. If enough players think it's not bogus, they can use up their currency to put a ! after it and you might end up with Sea Monkeys X!!! which means that 3 people like it and 1 person hates it. It goes into the fiction and I have to deal with it.<br/><br/>Also, Fred put forth a perfect example of an anti-flag, so there's no sense pretending that players don't have very specific things they want to say are right out.                        </div>

                            I think skipping a valuable scene, if you know it is valueable, can only be justified by logistical purposes.<br/><br/>That is: if we have limited time and I need to switch from player to player, I might choose the scene I think is best for each player rather than leave a player hanging (the sneaking, but not part inside).<br/><br/>If we have enough time to do all the scenes and everyone is engaged, a gaming session with more awesome scenes is better than one with fewer. It's also possible that, even if the sneaking-scene isn't *really* awesome, if it is valuable, something unexpected could happen that would push it over the top.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

                            Adam, I was highlighting the difference between "no interest in seeing this appear" and "I don't want this to appear."  My list of no-interest is, as I was point out, useless.  Anti-flags, which certainly exist, are more of the "I <em>don't</em> want this to appear" than "I don't care if this appears."  Y'know?                        </div>
