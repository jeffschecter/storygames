Has anyone tried Adwords as a way of marketing their indie games? What were your experiences?<br/><br/>I've been using Adwords for about a month to see what the results would be. I've got two products with a potential for fairly broad appeal to D&amp;D players. The results haven't been encouraging. While I've gotten a few dozen visits to my Web site, I've acheived exactly zero sales through Google Adwords.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I have learned some useful stuff. I've manage to improve my keyword technique so that between 0.5% and 3% of the people seeing the ad click on them. These are actually decent numbers, near as I can discover. I've found out which Google searches and which are bad. People searching for "dungeons &amp; dragons" aren't interested in what I'm selling. People searching for "dungeons &amp; dragons tiles" are, for example.<br/><br/>Anyone else? Has anyone gotten an actual confirmed sale by using Google Adwords?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179017/#Comment_179017" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T13:41:25+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  1:41PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony,<br/>\n  Can you go into any more detail?<br/>\n  How much did it cost (us it flat or per click or)?<br/>\n  What did you buy (is it a word, and if so, how did you pick it, did you change it and why)?<br/>\n  Are you still doing it, would you do it agion?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179026/#Comment_179026" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T14:58:22+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  2:58PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2008 2:59PM by PaulCzege.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt Gwinn experimented with AdWords for his badass wrestling RPG Kayfabe back in early 2005:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=14468.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=14468.0</a><br/><br/>The short answer:<br/>"The biggest problem I noticed is that Google has a tendency to slow or disable keywords that it feels are not meeting expectations.

You need to anticipate what your potential customers are looking for. This is an essential marketing exercise in and of itself. With his game, it sounds like Matt spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out who was looking for a wresting RPG. Generic terms like "roleplaying game" are often not great performers, but they get a lot of exposure, so there's a tradeoff in using them. They can generate more clicks by sheer mass, but they have to be shown many more times to generate those clicks. Figuring out which terms perform well tells you something about your product and who's looking for it.<br/><br/>Second is ad text. Your first ad won't work, guaranteed, so change and refine your ad over time.<br/><br/>Ad and keyword performance is measured in two ways. Click through rate (CTR) measures how many times your ad gets clicked per showing (a showing is called an impression). Conversion rate is how often a person who clicks your ad follows through and does what you're hoping for (like buy your product).<br/><br/>Third is your Web site. Your ad is appearing on a search page, so it's essentially a sponsored search result. If the Web page doesn't deliver what the ad seems to promise, people won't linger. Also Google charges more for keywords that don't match your Web page! You should consider optimizing your advertisement landing page so it highlights the keywords that are generating hits. This is also just plain good marketing.<br/><br/>There are a lot of other techniques, particularly around how you craft your landing page. I haven't implemented a lot of these yet, because I'm still learning. I recommend finding a good book on Adwords if you really want to get something out of it.<br/><br/>I'm pretty convinced there's a way that indie small press game designers can benefit from Adwords, but I confess I haven't found it yet. I'll make a post with some of my results and numbers after I drop my daughter off at kindergarten. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179130/#Comment_179130" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T10:49:54+00:00" title="November 18, 2008 10:49AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So here's a quick summary of my results with Adwords.<br/><br/>First of all, the product I decided to test Adwords with is a book of dungeon maps drawn in a "new old-school" style. I figure I've got an audience among D&amp;D players.<br/><br/>I selected a very broad range of D&amp;D related keywords. Initially I was getting between 0.1% and 0.2% CTR and no purchases.<br/><br/>Over time I was able to narrow down my keywords. I get 2-4% on my best keywords now. My best results are from searches for D&amp;D maps and related products, with <br/>dungeon crawls and dungeon ideas making a decent show as well.<br/><br/>I also refined my ads a lot over time to bring up the CTR.<br/><br/>I got a lot more clicks, but after spending about $10, no sales. Now I've switched my goal and instead of purchases, I'm tracking downloads of my sample PDF. My theory is that sample downloads help to educate people about what I'm doing with my maps and build some awareness. I'll try this for another $10 worth and see what my results are. I'll keep you posted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179173/#Comment_179173" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T12:25:16+00:00" title="November 18, 2008 12:25PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How long did that $10 last?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179176/#Comment_179176" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T12:29:08+00:00" title="November 18, 2008 12:29PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2008 12:29PM by tony_dowler.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A bit more than a month.

People will always click a relevant-looking search link before an ad word.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeally, your website should be set up to track incoming urls, preferably directly to the checkout. This enabled us to determine which ad resulted in the best sales/click through. A budget version of this is to have unique landing pages. This brings me onto the next point.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don't want click-throughs, you want sales. Your 0.5% to 3% click throughs are pretty good, but you also want to put people off who won't be interested in your products. Until you've had sales though, it's pretty hard to work this out.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou also have to check back frequently. In the end it was just too much hassle. We sold 10 products, and our products are about $40 each, and just about broke even. I imagine for RPGs, the margins just aren't there to make it worthwhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think investing the time and effort in getting links from customers, and improving content works a lot better. There was a tool which told you diagramatically which sites linked to yours (not are related to yours) but I am having trouble tracking it down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180645/#Comment_180645" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-28T09:25:38+00:00" title="November 28, 2008  9:25AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2008 9:28AM by jenskot.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check out Google's recent article on this subject... <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.google.com/adwords/tactics2008/" rel="nofollow">Top Tactics for Tough Times</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180672/#Comment_180672" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-28T13:50:38+00:00" title="November 28, 2008  1:50PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good article, thanks!<br/><br/>So a week ago, I made some major changes to my Adwords strategy, and I've seen some useful results. Instead of just tracking purchases, I'm now also tracking downloads of my free preview PDF. This makes a lot of sense, because my approach to marketing isn't just to get people to buy my stuff, it\u2019s about getting my stuff into the hands of the right people. By tracking downloads, I can see if my ad campaign is producing good results other than sales. <br/><br/>After a week, I can see that people who click the ad are downloading the preview. I can also see that some keywords perform differently. Some words that produce many clicks, don\u2019t produce downloads. Probably my book doesn\u2019t match what the keyword users are looking for. I can safely eliminate those keywords. They also happen to be my most expensive keywords. Cutting them will reduce the overall investment per conversion (conversion is marketing speak for result--in this case, downloading a preview or buying a copy).<br/><br/>I can also now measure how much I'm paying per conversion. Right now I\u2019m investing around 20 cents per download. Based on this, I can decide whether the campaign is worth it for me. For now, I'm willing to pay 20 cents to expose another person to my craft. I\u2019d like to get this amount down to 15 cents.<br/><br/>Another thing I figured out recently is that I can track both sales and downloads separately and compare the two numbers (kind of dense of me not to figure that out sooner). I discovered this by accident. Apparently a campaign that I ran and then cancelled while I was experimenting produced a sale. This is a sale that happened several days after the ad was closed. This means someone clicked the ad, checked out the site, maybe downloaded the demo, then came back days later and made a purchase. That shows that free downloads do build interest in the product, which is a great thing to know.<br/><br/>Now that I\u2019m tracking sales and downloads separately, I can find out how many downloads I\u2019m getting relative to sales. For example, if I get one sale per 25 downloads, then at 20 cents per download, the ads have paid for themselves.<br/><br/>I'm ready to make a bold statement - in some cases I think that Adwords is a valid investment for small press game designers. I still have a lot of work before I can prove this statement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
