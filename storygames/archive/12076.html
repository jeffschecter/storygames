There were elephants, and everything.<br/>\n<br/>\n<u><b>Gonzo</b></u><br/>\n<br/>\nImagine you mixed time travel with the three stooges. You might get Socrates, Lenin and Hannibal on a mission to save the future. My favourite parts included Socrates convincing the hospital orderlies that Lenin was suffering a "rupturing of the three major humours," Hannibal riding his laser mounted war elephants in the far distant future, and Lenin using the Tarantula-esque Walker to destroy the city ("Lenin Smaaaaash!") just after he'd thrown JFK from the cockpit (had we somehow made a political statement?).<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter Lenin was evaporated form time and Socrates was tricked by Stephen Hawking, it was up to Hannibal to save the day. It involved a boot, an uppercut, time delay explosives and a wink across time into the Jurassic age. The last shot was Hannibal materialising under the belly of a Apatosaurus with artillery shells peppered through his chest like cocktail sticks. Badabooooom! Cheeeeeese. Beautiful, tasty, fatty cheese. Yum.<br/>\n<br/>\n<u><b>Quick Framing</b></u><br/>\n<br/>\nWe used the new Quick Framing rules, where players build the <b>Frame </b>by bidding their ideas with tokens.Joe had an idea for a Prologue: <b>November 22nd 1963</b>. The characters were sent back in time to kill the would-be destroyer of humanity, John F. Kennedy.The game plan went something lie this: Chrono-vigilantes running from the time cops. After assassinating J.F.K. we would have to steal his brain to overcome the ruthless dystopian future.<br/>\n<br/>\n<u>Musings</u>: The Quick Framing rules work well. There's one guideline I love: <b>there\u2019s no such thing as \u201cno.</b>\u201d You don't like a suggestion? No problem, suggest something else. Can't think of anything better? Then shut up. Creative <i>blocking </i>is nasty. It stifles play. I think the Quick Framing rules monitor that pretty nicely.<br/>\n<u><br/>\n<b>Dealer</b></u><br/>\n<br/>\nIn the revised rules, there is a <b>Dealer </b>who sets up a scene. He provides atmosphere (<b>Backdrop</b>), awards Story Pips if people are roleplaying well (<b>Applause</b>), and presents a <b>Challenge </b>(so players get to use the tower of dice mechanic).<br/>\n<br/>\n<u>Musings</u>: Once again, Backdrops were confused with Challenges. That is, the Backdrop part (where the Dealer should present a scene without conflict) was being used to <b>present </b>conflict (the domain of a Challenge). Oops. Big time.<b></b><br/>\n<br/>\n<u><b>Intensity</b></u><br/>\n<br/>\nThe Dealer rules are there to ease the creative pressure. Spotlighting one player as "controller" gives everyone else some room to stretch. During this session, I was able to chill out and and enjoy a great scene without the obligation of contribution. Sometimes it's nice to watch.<br/>\n<br/>\n<u><b>Stuff</b></u><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Prologue</b>: 60s, time travel, JFK's assassination<br/>\n<b>Adversary</b>: Time Cops<br/>\n<b>Gore Threshold</b>: 4<br/>\n<b>Connection</b>: Former time cops, now chrono-vigilantes!<br/>\n<b>Drop-Off</b>: Grassy Knoll<br/>\n<b>Destination</b>: Pleasant Island, Nuclear Testing Area<br/>\n<b>Checkpoints</b>: Set off EMP bomb, Steal Kennedy's brain, Stow away on the test subject battle cruiser<br/>\n<b>Finale Missions</b>: Steal Mecha-Kennedy's brain...again, Destroy the temporal Nexus, Escape to the land of dinosaurs<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Playing time</b>:2 1/2 hours. <b>End Game</b>:Finale. <b>Survivors</b>: None. <b><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://cobwebgames.com" rel="nofollow">Ruleset:1.05</a></b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270570/#Comment_270570" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-10T01:35:29+00:00" title="May 10, 2010  1:35AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds insane.

It's the moment when one fellow says "I want to play Zombies in the apocalypse" and the other guy says "eh, no, that's lame." Then there's the silence.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne man's "no" is another man's wasted energy. One instance won't kill the game, but repeated negativity will.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Quick Framing rules, I'm asking players to put their money where their mouth is. No more "no." I totally encourage gamers to "one-up" one another\u2014an organic way to build unpredictable, collaborative stories\u2014but I discourage players from outright veto (unless they've got a better idea).<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that answer the first part of your question?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270575/#Comment_270575" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-10T04:18:04+00:00" title="May 10, 2010  4:18AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oops. I forgot to answer the other part.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know what? I'm not an expert on this subject. Perhaps you could help me to figure out the answer to that?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Universalis, the game is built on a system of bidding. <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="https://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16190&amp;cat=0&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Best Friends</a>s, Gregor Hutton's satirical game of girlish friendship, also uses a bidding mechanic, but not <i>overtly </i>in the way you're suggesting. In Best Friends, you spend pips to control the narrative. The idea is that you're negating the narration of an opposing character (one player says she gives you a black eye, you spend a pip and say, "no, I dodge and pull out your hair and all the boys laugh at you.").  This is more like antagonistic bidding than coolness bidding.<br/>\n<br/>\nEssentially, there would have to be a currency that allowed you to say "oh, wait, me, me, me, I've got a cool idea!" and then spend a pip to add your narration. Not so different from the guidelines of most of the indie games. The great boon to this, of course, would be that it could help newcomers adjust to the idea of narrative control (and at the same time prevent "blocking," as described above). That is, players are restricted/empowered by the use of pips, on the one hand giving everyone a chance to hop in someone's screen time and on the other hand regulating the same. And players could earn new pips by taking on board suggestions? (This is essentially the Best Friends economy)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
