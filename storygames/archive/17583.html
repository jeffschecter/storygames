They are dancing to solve every single one of their problems. All of them have taken as much dance as they can (Except for another who instead uses his amazing abaility as a choreographer, and their street art afficionado).<br/>I am not complaining on their effectively turning the game into Step up 5, but I feel the need to present challenges that appropriately sit against their motivations.<br/>Asides from a rival fey dancing troupe, I must admit I am struggling for ideas, so I thought I would put this to the forum.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398568/#Comment_398568" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-24T09:08:02+00:00" title="November 24, 2012  9:08AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is the best problem <i>ever</i>.<br/><br/>White Wolf works best when it mythologises things.

I feel I should probably set a bit more of the stage, so to speak, with a short campaign recap.<br/><br/>The players are at a highschool in England, and have recently found out the entire city they live in was built on the rock Prometheus was chained to. They are members of the school's 'Reading Club' (By virtue that no right-minded teenager would ever reliably join a reading club of their own volition and thereby it makes the perfect cover story for a club of divine beings combatting supernatural efffects. Also, library resources). The general campaign tone is a melange of myth, Buffy and Clamp Campus.<br/><br/>Story arcs so far have included:<br/>Black Annis is now the school's new bus driver and is using it as a ruse to capture children en masse! They did some detective work to find out what had been causing the disappearances, and then proceeded to recite shakespeare to a public audience in order to distract them while they through her out of her own bus. Via the windscreen. Whilst it was moving.<br/><br/>There are ghosts inside the school building from previous fallen members of the reading club! They get some lore dumps, and find out that there is both a Dirawong Canal Cabal, and a Selkie Canal raiding party, opposed to eachother. They proceed to extract further information by dance, and set the spirits free, rather than fighting poltergeists. This was left rather open-ended, as it plans to be an arc I shall return to.<br/><br/>There are Peruvian hats that control the mind of the wearer, causing them to become characters from Journey to the West, turning up and around, and it looks like they have been purchased from the German Christmas market that has opened up in town. It turns out that Sun Wukong has hijacked the market, turning it into ~SUN WUKONG'S WORLD OF FUN~. They decide to make him back down by dancing the best version of Journey to the West that he has ever seen in his life, and he proceeds to be thoroughly impressed and, giggling, leaves. It also turns out that Thor(as Donner) has opened a bar here to relax a bit around yuletide, and they end up getting drunk and composing a Scandinavian rock-metal opera about the deeds of Loki and Thor in order to impress him.<br/><br/>And then our most recent session:<br/>The players find out that their school has been challenged to a Gaelic Football match by a rival school. Only problem is, that rival school's team is made up of children of Lugh, the Irish God of versatility. They decide the best way to deal with this situation is to gather as much divine alcohol as they can find, and by dancing for it, stealing it, pleading for it and a bit of bartering too, manage to brew a horrific cocktail of the Mead of Poetry, Kalfu's Rum, and the Celestial bureaucracy's Plum wine, instead end up waking up the next morning with a terrifying hangover and no memory of what they did the day before. Except that apparently it cut a 3 mile wide cleft between the football pitch and their houses, and is getting national media coverage.<br/><br/>I certainly appreciate their imagination, and willingness to deal with problems in fashions other than hitting it with sharp objects, and you can clearly see we are going for a certain breed of camp within the game itself, so some of the ideas really really fit...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398627/#Comment_398627" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-25T04:59:57+00:00" title="November 25, 2012  4:59AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems obvious to me that the school dance club, cheerleader squad and other such parties would take notice of all this dancing.

Clearly a school where students get so obsenely drunk that it ends up on international TV is putting a lot of pressure on them from up top.<br/>Poor students begin mysteriously disappearing from their class in the preceding days. Looks like the headmaster is just pushing all the trouble kids under the carpet, like most do. BUT! On closer inspection the party finds out that the Headmaster is Quetzacoatl, and has been sacrificing them in exchange for a good OFSTED report.<br/>Also the Ofsted inspector is really a dragon who has it in for the school after they built the gym over his old hoarding ground.<br/>So the players smoothly cause as much chaos as possible in the classroom, get their headmaster fired, convince the dragon that that is the only problem with the school and then proceed to bunk him off quite effectively in the background. (With cries of 'Thing in a suit wants to shut the school down... Maybe he wants us to dance to solve this problem... Better kill it!')<br/>Their replacement head is the direct Selkie descendant of Captain Cook. We left the session at his introduction, and the subsequent storming out of the school hall by one of the PCs, who is of aboriginal divine descent.<br/><br/>I really love this party, always keep me on my toes~                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
