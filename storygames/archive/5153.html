My brother is a hyperactive, 10-year old menace... but he does really like me and miss me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I asked him if he wanted to try playing a roleplaying game and he said yes. I pulled out Beast Hunters (probably the far limit of his attention span and creative energy. It's focused on immediate, concrete problems so I think it'll work out.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe made a character, and when we finished he was pretty wiped out so we put it aside for later. I think the character creation process was finally clicking for him in the fourth stage, while we went over Beast Hunter training. At first it was a lot of blank-page, rather-be-playing-playstation looks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, here is his character. I wrote the blank character sheet and his name, but he did everything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeast Hunter: Kuchika<br/>\nTribe: The Warriors (!!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nInitiative: Social 2, Mental 2, Physical 3<br/>\n<br/>\nDamages:<br/>\nSocial:         00 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0<br/>\nPhysical:     000 / 00 / 0 / 0 / 0<br/>\nMental:        0 / 00 / 0 / 0 / 0<br/>\n<br/>\n(Note: Astute playas will note that his Mental damage track is illegal, because there are more mediums than lights. Whatever, I didn't want to complicate or frustrate the situation by explaining technical violations. I just rolled with the little stuff.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="100_1077.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://i109.photobucket.com/albums/n72/joepub/100_1077.jpg"/><br/>\n<br/>\nOffensive Traits:<br/>\nStrong PO+3<br/>\nI was raised as a fighter PO+1<br/>\nKnow how to fight PO+2<br/>\nNavigate in snow MO+2<br/>\nI hate Vikings SO+1<br/>\nSwing a sword PO+1<br/>\n<br/>\nDefensive Traits:<br/>\nPretective SD+3<br/>\nDifferent Languages MD+2<br/>\nLove Country MD+1<br/>\nSelf Defense PD+2<br/>\n<br/>\nOffensive Resources:<br/>\nCrossbow PO+2<br/>\nTraps PO+1<br/>\nCompass MO+2<br/>\n<br/>\nDefensive Resources:<br/>\nKhamsa necklace MD+1<br/>\nArmer PO+3<br/>\nCalling horn SD+1<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: Astute playas might note that Vikings don't exist in the canon setting, which is what I pitched to him. When I asked what his enemies were, he thought really hard... then his face light up and he proudly declared "Vikings!" Fuckin' rights, Greg. There are Vikings now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first I was really worried he might have a static character. Note the first three of his Offensive Traits.<br/>\nBut, couple them with pretective/love country/self defense... and then throw in the fact that he's a good scout (navigate in snow/compass/traps/calling horn), I think there's some good potential there. A patriotic scout trekking through the snowy wasteland in search of Vikings to fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe agreed to play in the car ride, on the way to the Greyhound station (we live in an isolated community, so that's about 1.5 hours of solid play time).<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone played Beast Hunters with a younger audience? How about in a short time frame? How about in a car?<br/>\nIf so, any tips?<br/>\nIf not, isn't his character badass?<br/>\n<br/>\nI hate Vikings SO+1 makes my life complete, basically.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116328/#Comment_116328" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-26T11:08:31+00:00" title="December 26, 2007 11:08AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I havn't played Beast Hunters with a short time frame, but would recomend picking a low point total for the quest and really front loading the conflict - maybe start in media res kicking Viking ass.<br><br>And yes his character looks quite baddass <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> I have a stong urge to go out and kick some Viking Ass myself via Beast Hunters.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116332/#Comment_116332" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-26T11:27:42+00:00" title="December 26, 2007 11:27AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Colin, good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking set up a Limit and Pool like 6/15.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat'd be enough for two full conflicts and a smaller intermediary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116386/#Comment_116386" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-26T18:52:13+00:00" title="December 26, 2007  6:52PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is, indeed, an awesome character <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  In fact, it made my day.<br><br>As for suggestions: Colin is right on regarding setup.<br><br>For play: Be generous. Give him a good amount of AP. Let him get into the swing of being a real badass before you get to the part about challenging him. <br><br>In my experience with my boys, younger kids tend to take more liberty with what they get to decide than traditionally-trained roleplayers. That's great! Tell him he can make up all sorts of shit in his maneuvers about how he takes out this guy and that one.<br><br>Introduce a few colorful enemies. Make them ugly and gigantic and mean. They'll be memorable and fun to kill. If he narrates a kill immediately, well, just have others take that place instead of blocking his input.<br><br>Also, I'd focus on physical conflicts first, then make other conflicts very intuitive for kids: if it's social, make it a showing-off contest, or something like that where different actions are easy to come up with. Like, "Impress the guardian of the temple" as a social conflict, and then he can lift rocks, do somersaults, or what the hell ever he wants.<br><br>Good hunting, and let me know how it went!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116467/#Comment_116467" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T07:58:02+00:00" title="December 27, 2007  7:58AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I got to the "I hate Vikings" part of the character sheet, I couldn't help but smile.
