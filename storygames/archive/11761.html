So here is what I gleaned from the internet...</i>\n<blockquote><b>Game Design Buddy System</b><br/><br/>What we are here to work on is our PROGRESS.  Not spelling, style, layout or anything else.  Don't make excuses; the ultimate goal here is to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">finish a game</span>, not commiserate.<br/><br/>A design buddy wants to help you and wants to get help too.  Your buddy knows the same challenges as you.  They want to accountable, so do you.<br/><br/>A good start we can try is weekly check-ins; buddies will review each other's progress and exchange goals for next week.  You rate <span style="text-decoration: underline;">yourself</span>.  If you aren't satisfied, your buddy will start with the ridiculously obvious questions, like 'What feeling of success did you miss out on?'  In closing, you will exchange next week's goals with your buddy.<br/><br/>If your buddy's goals seem a bit much, suggest a different approach and vice versa; goals too big will frustrate, ones too little won't make us 'stretch' enough to improve.  No matter how exciting the work gets, stick to your schedule; don't overwhelm your buddy with contacts.<br/><br/>The purpose is to support and encourage; compliment good progress and don't mention a lacking.  When you want to give up, your buddy is there to get you through it.  You'll know it's working when you look forward to checking in and celebrating together.<br/><br/>Remember, failing to proceed is not an opportunity to stop; it's a sign you may want to reconsider the direction you're taking.  Simply: you can't fail to design a game, but you <i>can</i> give up.</blockquote>\nI'm trying to rewrite my Stat explanation text to make it smoother for new-to-role-playing crowd.  Here is the raw text:\n<blockquote>To begin filling out your character sheet, go to the Stats section.<br/><br/><b>Stats</b><br/><b>How strong is your Character?</b><br/>What are Stats?  These are the general measurements of how your character compares to the bulk of humanity.  Take the first Stat, Strength for example; it describes how strong your character is.<br/><br/>Most people average out to around 10.  How much is 11?  Consider this: an olympic weight-lifter comes out to about 14, so an 11 is a significant step towards that.  How weak do people get?  Around an 8; I know this doesn't seem like a wide range, but in games where everyone plays human, there isn't a big call for comparing strengths.<br/><br/><b>Use the UE chart (our only chart)</b><br/>When you play the greater range of Strength, you can determine how much your character can lift by consulting the UE Chart.  This gives you a clear maximum for your character.  This is why Strength is called a 'magnitude' Stat; it measures a maximum of something.<br/><br/><b>What happens when they want to do something adroitly?</b><br/><b>Roll 2d10 against the Agility Stat</b><br/>The next Stat is a little different; Agility doesn't just measure how agile your character is, but it gives you a target number to roll under.  The difference between your roll and your character's Agility is the rating of how adroitly they performed.  Because you roll against it, Agility is called an 'efficacy' Stat.<br/><br/><b>What happens when your character gets hurt?</b><br/>Next is Hit Points.  This is the number of 'health units' your character can lose before they lose the will to fight.  Injuries, deaths and comas have very special devices in this game, so Hit Points don't determine anything about them.<br/><br/><b>Take away Hit Points</b><br/>Hit Points are called a 'resource' Stat because you can use them up during play (mostly by getting your character hurt).  Hit Points can be healed back in several ways, but Hit Points don't really say anything about what's wrong.  For example, if you have a broken arm, that's handled like a disadvantage and heals based on in-game time.  Poisoning is also a disadvantage with obvious recovery possibilities.  Taking those into account, your hit points reflect how much fight your character has left in them.<br/><br/><b>How quickly can the character respond?</b><br/><b>Roll Reaction</b><br/>Reaction is the next Stat on the list.  This is also an 'efficacy' Stat like Agility, regarding how quickly your character can react to serious consequences appropriately.  Situations can vary widely so each will come with its own bonuses and penalties.  If you roll lower than your Reaction, your character can react quickly enough.<br/><br/><b>How much can they take in quickly?</b><br/><b>Observation on UE Chart</b><br/>The next Stat can act as both a 'magnitude' Stat (like Strength) and an 'efficacy' Stat (like Agility).  Most often, you'll look up Observation on the UE Chart to see how much your character can take in at once.  Occasionally, to create tension, you may need to roll against it to see if you caught a crucial detail.<br/><br/><b>How much power can they use?</b><br/><b>Spend POW</b><br/>Finally, is the Power Stat.  This Stat gets the most different kinds of usage.  In a Superhero game, it gets used mostly as a 'magnitude' (like Strength) of how powerful your character's superpowers are; when casting spells, it can get used up like a 'resource' Stat (like Hit Points); outside of magic, in a fantasy campaign, it might be used as an 'efficacy' Stat (like Agility) for resisting magic.</blockquote>\nYou see, Scattershot revolves mostly around the information on the character write-up.  If fact, the bulk of the rules will be in fine print with the sections they make use of.  The rules are rather brief.<br/><br/>By next week, I'd like to finish another rough draft, this one about how skills and die rolls work.<br/><br/>What have you got on deck for us this week, Micah?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262654/#Comment_262654" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T04:26:17+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  4:26AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not to try to shut you up Fang, but the Praxis site (see the right-most tab at the top of any S-G page) has a weekly "Accountability Check In" thread put up by Chris Engle that appears to be an informal version of exactly this.

I want the players to create detailed action sequences that would make fantastic scenes for a movie and I want those scenes to be framed by a compelling overall story involving interesting connected characters in a rich setting. A card game or board game can't do that. <br/><br/><b>What are my design goals?</b><br/>\u2022 Fun - I would like to avoid rules that you roll your eyes an groan at. I would like people to read the premise for the game and get excited to play it and I want that to increase when they see what the character's can do. I want character's to be competent and to do cool stuff as often as possible. I don't meant that they will always succeed and that they are never challenged or faced with difficult challenges, I just want a more "movie" or "novel" feel, where the protagonists don't "air ball" frequently, especially at critical times.<br/>\u2022 Fast - I don't want to make the time investment to get into the game be more than 15-20 minutes. It's good for players who are interested in playing, but even better for those who haven't played before. I would love to have a two page rules sheet that gives a new player everything they need to play, and maybe another 2 pages to GM it. I think much of the game will be included as part of the character sheet and I'm planning on doing as much character creation and rules explanation as possible in play, the way many modern video games do.<br/>\u2022 Quick - I want gameplay to move quickly, especially during action scenes. It makes no sense for an exchange of gunfire to last an 45 minutes. Action scenes should be adrenalin filled, not tedious. I don't want the game to be overwhelming when it comes to rules, charts, tables and other information that you need to know to play. If there are rules that can be combined to avoid complication I'll do it. If something complicated has to exist I'm going to make it as intuitive as possible and accessible as well (maybe on a character sheet or a GM's cheat sheet).<br/>\u2022 Collaborative - I want players decisions to matter to the story and to one another. I want to encourage team-work over individualism.<br/><br/><b>What are my sources of inspiration for it?</b><br/>Mostly John Harper's Agon. It certainly meets a lot of the criteria that I've mentioned and John's goal of trying his hand at redesigning D&amp;D to meet his needs really mirrors my own goals. <br/><br/>I've been inspired by many games, but whether that will show in the final design or not remains to be seen. Here is a brief (incomplete) list: Gregor Hutton's 3:16, Chris Perrin's Mecha, Willow Palecek's Awesome Adventures, Luke Crane's Mouse Guard, Vincent Baker's Dogs in the Vineyard and Pinnacle's Savage Worlds. <br/><br/><b>Why not just play those games instead (why am I designing a game rather than making a mod of an existing game)?</b><br/>I had been working on this game for a long time when I came across Agon (thanks to StoryGames). After reading it I started to mod Agon because it was really close to what I was envisioning and I soon realized that there were a few things that I wanted to exclude and a few that I wanted to include. I also had already come up with a few things that I really liked which I thought fit my goals a little better than Agon. Finally, I entertained the idea of doing a GMless game (which is still a possibility), so I decided that calling it a mod isn't really appropriate any more. If anything, like 3:16, it's a game design originally based on Agon, with some significant differences. <br/><br/><b>What things do I want my game to do really well?</b><br/>Descriptive fight scenes, brevity, consequences and teamwork.<br/><br/><b>Who am I designing it for?</b><br/>\u2022 Ultimately I'm designing it for myself. I don't know if people will really like a collaborative, team-based, GMless, descriptive, cinematic action game. Hopefully someone will, but if I'm the only one (and my group allows me to run it for them at least once) I think I'll be happy. Obviously I'm making a game with the hope that someone else will play it and enjoy it, but for the design of the game I'm trying to appease myself and tailor it to my desired play style and GMing style (or perhaps GMing deficiencies).<br/>\u2022 Secondarily I'm trying to keep in mind my friends who like games but have never tried out role-playing. Many of my design choices are aimed at taking away the barriers that I perceive as hindering their desire to cross into role-playing from card games or video games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264911/#Comment_264911" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-01T10:55:02+00:00" title="April  1, 2010 10:55AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's really interesting.

I've never done an NSI 20, but I did post a Power 19 on the Forge about a year ago. It was moderately helpful. <br/><br/>For this, I didn't want to overwhelm Fang with unnecessary detail so I just posted a few questions that I thought were relevant (and helpful to me). The purpose of the questions above is to have something to measure the success of my design by. So now when I create something and post it, I can look at my objectives and see if the design is supporting them or not. If they are, great, if not, I either need to rethink my design or my goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fang%20Langford" title="Fang Langford"><img alt="Fang Langford" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/042/nYHKMUMQV2HC4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fang%20Langford">Fang Langford</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265698/#Comment_265698" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T21:07:23+00:00" title="April  5, 2010  9:07PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2010 10:32PM by Fang Langford.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey!  Can I play?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mjbauer</cite>Answering the following questions will help give me a good base to start from.</blockquote>\n<b>Why make a game?</b><br/>That's easy.  No matter how hard I try, I cannot put game design aside.  I have always felt the best reason to design role-playing games (or anything for that matter) is because you can't avoid doing so.  You are a prisoner of your muse.<br/><br/><b>Why is it going to be a <i>Role-Playing</i> game and not another?</b><br/>It's funny you ask this separately.  Obviously, the previous answer could suffice.  In practice, I find role-playing games much more engaging.  I also do MMORPG, LARP and Interactive Fiction design.  Now with all these, I've grown to calling in-person, tabletop, role-playing gaming simply 'spoken word gaming' as it presents a good differentiation.  I am drawn to spoken word gaming because it offers the widest possibilities for the imagination in a social situation.<br/><br/><b>What are the design goals?</b><br/>That would be telling...let's just say I want to make an unassuming, old-fashioned game with a few secret features that take it way beyond the state of the art.<br/><br/><b>What inspires it?</b><br/>Every good game I've run or played in and how they follow some unwritten standards.  If I can't imagine any specific instance of that that Scattershot couldn't support, then I'm doing it right.<br/><br/><b>What games might be starting points or references?</b><br/>The review I read about 'blue box' D&amp;D in Games Magazine before I saw the game, Champions 1st Ed, the first Car Wars after the pocket editions, GURPS 3rd Ed, Mekton II, Teenagers from Outer Space, Marvel Superheroes 1st Ed (now FASERIP), DC Heroes 1st Ed, Mechwarrior 1st Ed, Shadowrun 2nd Printing, Rifts 1st Ed, Vampire: the Masquerade 1st Ed, World of Warcraft, Champions Online and every AD&amp;D 1st Ed game we ever played without opening the rulebook (in roughly that order).  Oh!  And I'm in the playtest for the LEGO Universe MMO.<br/><br/><b>Why not play another game instead?</b><br/>I haven't found one that 'hides' the parts of gaming that I don't want to think about in play without doing away with them.  Worse, this formula is different in every case even within the same genre or setting.  A game that would redact itself in this fashion unseen by the players, even as often as continuously, would be what I want.  Not only Transition\xb9, but constant Creative Agenda\xb2 revision on the fly without the attention of the participants or their displeasure.  (They say it cannot be done.\xb3)<br/><br/><b>What should this game do well?</b><br/>The whole 'hiding' and revisioning thing...uh, yeah.  That's exactly it.  And let's say I release it online with a new profit model and it makes money while being cheap and still being a labor of love.<br/><br/><b>Who am I designing it for?</b><br/>Anyone...everyone...you, me, people who have never played spoken word games, authors, doctors, scientists and...just everyone.  Of course, I'll start with baby steps: active gamers like you guys. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Love,<br/>Fang<br/><br/>\xb9 Since I invented this term, it means using game mechanics to switch Creative Agenda\xb2 during or between play.<br/><br/>\xb2 This term I don't feel like I properly understand it, but everyone keeps quoting it to me as if it relates to the specific 'how' a game does what it does while the participants do what they do.  Please don't hold me accountable for my misunderstanding of it; I'll just deny it on cross-examination anyway.<br/><br/>\xb3 At least everyone who responded to me on the Forge in the old days did.  I'm on medication now so I'm not sure if that's relevant anymore.<br/><br/>p.s. I'm putting my next entry on Praxis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
