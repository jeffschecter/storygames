I've lurked around this site actively for a year or two.  It's given me a lot of inspiration - so much so that I developed a homebrew system that, after some testing, has proven to be A LOT of fun and accessible to friends with no role-playing experience whatsoever.<br/><br/>Now I'm faced with a silly dilemma: the system is pretty rules light.  I keep trying to add rules to make it "rule heavy" or, for lack of a better term, "longer lasting" (we want to keep playing it, but there isn't much to add to characters once you have them fleshed out!).  Anywho, has anyone had experience with this problem or something similar?  Can rules light games last...well...for a very long time (and can you name some!)?<br/><br/>I want to eventually share this with everyone...especially because I have been so influenced by what y'all have shown me here!<br/><br/>Best,<br/>~Klaus                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366099/#Comment_366099" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T16:00:15+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  4:00PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course they can last a while.

All other things being equal, there's no reason why you couldn't get satisfying play from a very simple game for the same length of time you'd get satisfying play from a very mechanically complex game.<br/><br/>But!<br/><br/>Here's the twist, and I think maybe the source of your concern. Satisfying play usually requires some kind of sense of "progress". That progress can take many different forms. In games like D&amp;D that progress is about going up levels, getting access to new mechanics and new fictional content. In a game like Sorcerer, the sense of progress is provided by getting closer to answering the question "how far will you go to get what you want".<br/><br/>Often, one of the things that the mechanics of a game provide is a way of formally tracking that "progress". That's a useful thing. Depending on what "progress" means in your game, it might be useful to have a mechanical way of marking that progress, or it might not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366101/#Comment_366101" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T16:03:06+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  4:03PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can totally make a great, 'long lasting' rules lite game if the few mechanics you do have interact in a multitude of ways that creates <i>complexity during play.</i><br/><br/>Look at chess - you could write the actual rules in a paragraph, but fill libraries on the best way to apply them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/k.graz" title="k.graz"><img alt="k.graz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/049/nXPWPVIT01SE7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/k.graz">k.graz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366105/#Comment_366105" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T16:23:31+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  4:23PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Simon">@Simon</a> C<br/><br/>You understand my question perfectly (sorry if I'm vague when I talk about games).

When I was playing a lot of UA, my GM friend originally had us advancing too quickly, and we did tire of our characters.  I'm realizing that if I want my friend's PCs to survive past the testing stages, I should probably follow a similar model.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans c-o</cite>That's just the setting, though! What about the<i>game</i>?</blockquote>\nThe game itself is based on a pretty simple engine.  You only roll when you are uncertain of the outcome or under duress.  There are more quirks than this, but step by step here's what you do...<br/><br/>1.  Outline what your goal is<br/>2.  think of all the bad things that might happen<br/>3.  roll a handful of d6s <br/>4.  take the highest roll and compare it to the degree of success.<br/><br/>Highest Roll Chart (Degree of success)<br/>1-3 = No such luck...goal fails, bad things happen.<br/>4-5 = Closer...a step closer to the goal (you can try again and take +1d6 to your new attempt; if you try again, the bad things are the same as before)<br/>6 = Victory!...goal succeeds, bad things disappear.<br/><br/>It's clearly influenced by a lot of stuff I've seen around here, especially stuff I've talked about in other threads.  That said, we are having a really good time whenever we test it.  It seems to just "make sense" to everyone I game with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366236/#Comment_366236" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T09:31:45+00:00" title="March  9, 2012  9:31AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How does the game itself work, though?<br/><br/>What do the players do?<br/><br/>What does the GM do?
