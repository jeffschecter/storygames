That person reacts as quickly as possible, points to another person and says, "Zap." The third person reacts quickly again, points to another person and says, "Zop." People continue pointing and saying 'Zip, Zap, Zop' in sequence, getting faster and faster until someone decides to end it (usually the person who started, who signals the end by clapping)<br/><br/>Invisible Knife: Throw an invisible knife amongst the participants. Usually done fast, and with a lot of thought on the physicality of the knife, but can also be done 'Matrix Style' in ultra slow motion, which encourages physicality on the player's part.<br/><br/>Badada: Everyone claps in time on their thighs. One person looks at their neighbor and says a word, the neighbor makes a word association and then the entire group says the two words and badada. <br/>EXAMPLE: <br/>(clapping in time) <br/>1: "Horse" <br/>2: "Buggy" <br/>All: "HORSE BUGGY BADADA!"<br/>2: Sin<br/>3: Angel<br/>All: SIN ANGEL BADADA!<br/>3: Pork<br/>4: Barrel<br/>ALL: PORK BARREL BADADA<br/>4: Shine<br/>1: Shoe<br/>ALL: SHINE SHOE BADADA!<br/>and on and on, until everyone is checked in and silly.<br/><br/>None of these work if everyone isn't involved.

The nice thing about this is that you don't have to take anybody's word for it - just try it and see.  Check in, and choose the one you find least intimidating.

You can always just do the eye contact thing, just stand up, says, "OKay everyone, check in with each other. We ready to play? Let's go!"

The function in question is, as Chris Lerich would put it, "Opening the ritual." It's akin to a themesong at the beginning of a TV show or such. It says, "Now we're beginning. Take note. Get your head in the activity. Even if it means we have to do something to clear your head of everything else that's in it right now."<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of other methods work just as well, I've found (thought, of course it's going to depend on the group). One that Josh Neff used to good effect is to play a theme song for the game - just like the TV show. While you wait for it to play out, your head gets thinking about the game, and other things from the day go away. He also began his games with a recap of the action that always began, "When last we saw our intrepid heroes..."<br/>\n<br/>\nFamiliarity can do a lot for people here. That is, ritual elements that are familiar are both comforting, and cue one into the right sort of behavior if done time and again.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmups, like the ones above, are better if you want to "shake people up" in order to get them out of their comfort zone. Get them used to doing something odd so that they might "think outside the box" in their play. I think there's value in that. But I also think that there's value in a familiar ritual.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn either case, players are informed that they are now all participating together in the activity in question. Time to play the RPG. In many groups, it comes down to the GM having to basically use social methods to get everyone seated, and thinking about the game. A warm up, or some other method often makes this much, much easier, and can be way more effective in terms of actually getting the participants engaged.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65267/#Comment_65267" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T08:22:38+00:00" title="April 25, 2007  8:22AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, one person threatened me with death, if that's any indication about how this idea went down. <br><br>Now, I would in all seriousness want to do this before my next honest-to-goodness, sit down at the table gaming session. <br>It just sounds fun and funny!                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65268/#Comment_65268" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T08:23:16+00:00" title="April 25, 2007  8:23AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See you at Nerdly, James - there will be warm-ups aplenty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65292/#Comment_65292" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T10:03:08+00:00" title="April 25, 2007 10:03AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2007 10:05AM by John_Harper.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We warmed up with Jungle Speed last time.

But this has been going of for many years and is, to be honest, probably something of a mental warm up, now that I come to think of it.<br><br>It's pretty simple.  People arrive at my house and I make sure everyone's beer is put away in the fridge.  We shoot the breeze until everyone's arrived.  Then there is something, a bookend to the game if you like, which separates the breeze-shooting from the actual play.<br><br/>For example, during 2005 I ran a pretty lengthy scifi/superpunk game called Charming Demons.  Part of the schtick was that it was a TV series, it was pretty dark and it had an undertone of (quite silly) humour.  We'd watch the latest episode of Robot Chicken, which was just perfect.  Not because the game was anything like Robot Chicken, but because it got everyone laughing, often at pretty unpleasant stuff and it was like an intense 13 minute double espresso of pop culture.  Watching that set everyone up for the game, just opened a few mental channels.  Then I played the theme tune we'd picked (which was Just Because by Jane's Addiction) and that really marked the start of the game.  It was also the start of a random playlist I'd knock up using Moodlogic which would run quietly while we were playing.<br/><br/>Last year's game was the infamous 50 Fathoms Legofest.  The intro was more about the players re-capping what they'd been doing last session, spending XP where appropriate and again, drinking beer.  Although we somehow instituted a "grog only" policy during the game, which seemed to mean that could drink anything you liked as long as you called it grog.  So coffee was called grog and so was Hoegaarden.  Also the music again, although no theme tune.<br/><br/>This year we've been mostly playtesting Uml\xc3\xa4ut, and because that's all about Metal we listen to Metal while playing.  Also my new house has a pretty cool table in the kitchen, so there's more of a separation: We are now sitting at the table, that must mean we're playing.  Warm up is basically telling jokes and laughing about what we did last week.  Focuses attention and gets people thinking.<br/><br/>Anything physical is not going to wash with me.  Gaming is a mental process, and warming up for it needs to be a mental process, not a physical one.
