I based the problems on the Dogs' choices in the previous town. I got to "Sin" and when I finished, I literally wrote "I think this is juicy enough". My (ragingly homicidal) Dogs didn't murder anyone... though they still blamed the Steward and defrocked him.<br/><br/>I've run Dogs sporadically now for about five years, and this is the first time I feel like I really did it right.<br/><br/>That's... well, that's about it. Now to figure out how to step it up for next time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354296/#Comment_354296" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-15T00:13:27+00:00" title="January 15, 2012 12:13AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: deadlytoque</cite><br/>I've run Dogs sporadically now for about five years, and this is the first time I feel like I really did it right.</blockquote>\nDo you know what you did that made it "right"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354418/#Comment_354418" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-15T21:35:59+00:00" title="January 15, 2012  9:35PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it was that I made a town that was RIFE with sin; all the sins were understandable, human sins; it would be tempting for the Dogs to just shoot 'em all and let the King of Life sort them out; but solving the problem that way would likely just encourage it to happen again.<br/><br/>Basically, the town had just overthrown their leadership and had set up a democratic form of government (pride leading to sins of stewardship). However, the overthrow was assisted by the Steward, who was a former Dog himself: he said "we used to overthrow government all the time back when I was a Dog, so it must be right." Therefore, when the players showed up and found out about the stewardship issue (as well as the adultery and apostasy that were spin-off problems) they had to think long and hard before shooting anybody.<br/><br/>I guess the magic of it was that the badness was really subtle, but really "bad" as per the dogma that had been established.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
