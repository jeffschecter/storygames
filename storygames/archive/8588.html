Hit me with anything that'll come to your mind after reading this post, seriously.<br/><br/>All right! I want a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_(medieval)" rel="nofollow">tournament</a>\u2014a fantasy/medieval one this time, though it's not that much different from any other contest/competition, I guess. The tournament consists of all kinds of knights competing in jousting, bohort, m\xeal\xe9e, scharm\xfctzel (ancient form of LARP: assaulting a toy fortress), possibly the races, this kind of stuff. The trickiest part is that it's a solo game: there's only one player, and the character (called the hero later on) basically plans to win the tournament. And not groundlessly so, but I don't want to go "Ok, you've won" and be done with it. I'm sure it is possible to make a nice and awesome game about having a tournament bits of which will move the story forward and involve some dice-rolling. The tournament has a broader context, so the story boosts, on one hand, does not have to be limited, and on the other hand, as long as the hero wins or comes close enough to winning, the big plot is safe.<br/><br/>I've glanced over some games that have specific rules for duelling, but they're all way too specific, I don't want to have just a long sequence of usual d&amp;d-style battles. I've googled and asked around for some indie games, and found a handful, with the best that I've seen probably being Contenders, but it's still not what I want.<br/><br/>I probably want some handy conflict resolution system that would stir the player's imagination (mine too) and encourage us to make a nice story around the events. Surely, I can always prep a dozen of scenes with the most noticeable opponents, roll an opposed d20 or something for each and narrate the rest, let's see if we can come up with anything better than that. Don't bother telling me to go watch some tournament-based anime, I've seen them all already, but if you have any thoughts on applying that directly to the situation, I'm all ears.<br/><br/>I think I see four different sorts of activities one can participate in in a tournament:\n<ol>\n<li>Jousting-like contests where the hero is pitted against an opponent. The hero can meet new people, hear some info, etc. What if he happens to be losing, can you give me some ideas on what can he trade for a boost or at least for a chance to lose in an impressive way? Death spiral is out of place here, IMHO.</li>\n<li>M\xeal\xe9e-like contests where the hero is up against everyone else. The same, with possible tactical alliances? Or just treat it like a set of one-on-one duels?</li>\n<li>Scharm\xfctzel-like contests where something is going on, and the hero needs to stand out. Some skill-challenge-ish mechanism for CR, encouraging stunts?</li>\n<li>PC vs PC duels. I'm deliberately leaving this one out for the time being. There are problems specific to this sort of contest, and I want to avoid having to deal with them for now.</li>\n</ol>\nThat's about it for a start. Sorry for being unclear, I'm not sure in lots of details myself as you can probably see. Just hit me with anything that seems important and cool to you.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190345/#Comment_190345" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-27T20:12:02+00:00" title="January 27, 2009  8:12PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This may sound strange, but I'm wondering if you could layer some mini-games on top of Bacchanal (<a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/bacchanal" rel="nofollow">free version</a>).  Replace wine with ale, sexuality with chivalry, satyrs with highborn damsels, etc.  It looks like it might be solo-able, but I myself have never played it even in a group, so I'm not real sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arturo%20G." title="Arturo G."><img alt="Arturo G." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arturo%20G.">Arturo G.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190459/#Comment_190459" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-28T14:54:56+00:00" title="January 28, 2009  2:54PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2009 2:57PM by Arturo G..">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you thought on scenes apart from the fighting ones? Scenes about what is happening in-between contests to let the characters interact (with other PCs and NPCs) and reveal themselves. I would say you may consider why are they fighting for, what are they going to use to boost their interest to win the fight when facing pain or dishonor.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is not what you are looking for, but I would take <em>Contenders</em> and I would change the boxing fights with tournament activities adapting the details.<br/><br/>Just an idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
