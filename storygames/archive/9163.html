The images are published on a Creative Commons-licence at Flickr. I work as a journalist in a Norwegian Online, but this is a more or less private project.<br/><br/>If you'd like to look at some of my stuff, you can see the tagged images here: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/77272877@N00/sets/72157616858288626/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/77272877@N00/sets/72157616858288626/</a><br/><br/>Here's a feed for stuff I'm just finding around and haven't bothered sorting: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/77272877@N00/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/77272877@N00/</a><br/><br/>Here's an explanatory article (alas in the Norwegian, but you might be able to use Babelfish at Altavista or some Google translation service): <a href="http://www.abcnyheter.no/node/87161" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.abcnyheter.no/node/87161</a><br/><br/>A big inspiration for my project is obviously the great science fiction/thriller author William Gibson, but there are also others whom you may, or may not, have heard about.<br/><br/>This invitation goes out to a very select group of forums and individuals. If you believe that words like "disco tantra" have any kind of meaning beyond the metaphorical level, It may or may not be a good idea for you to peruse this stuff. But it's obviously up to you.<br/><br/>I would strongly encourage every potential street artist to consider local rules and regulations, and preferably play by them.<br/><br/>As above/ So below. <br/><br/>Please be safe. And please don't hack my account.<br/><br/>Improvise - adapt - overcome<br/><br/>Much love<br/><br/>OPG                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
