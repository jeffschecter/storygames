But I look at the list of games in the IPR catalog, the various design contests, and that list of "games I am not working on" and my brain spins.  How many games can we sustain?  Is the point of all this that we move from being consumers to producers?  Am I to take all this in?  What do I buy?  Who should I support?  Is there a line to be crossed that the hobby should be concerned about?<br/><br/>So as I think about this I think about the numbers.  <br/><br/>Do you hope to sell you're game?  If so, how many copies do you hope to sell?  How many people do you expect to play it?<br/><br/>Those numbers have to then interact with the community of gamers that WOULD play it, no?<br/><br/>Quizically,<br/>- Don                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78108/#Comment_78108" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-27T11:29:56+00:00" title="June 27, 2007 11:29AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don,<br/><br/>I totally see the concern, but I don't think we need to worry about it yet.

How will we find quality, will quality be overwhelmed by a massive tide of crap, will the mob rule, et cetera.<br/><br/>The worry that you're voicing is not identical to these concerns, but I think it has a similar answer: we'll work it out over time. Also, bear in mind that you're looking at the field from the point of view of, well, someone who reads and posts to SG.com. Whereas new folks' view of the field is basically Dogs, PTA, Polaris, Mountain Witch, and now SotC, and everything else is kind of a blur until they step deeper in.

Is the point of all this that we move from being consumers to producers? Am I to take all this in? What do I buy? Who should I support?<br/></blockquote>\nThe really simple answer is that you (we) should buy the games that you think look cool and that you want to play. We've moved past the point where anybody should feel like they have to buy one of everything to support the community, or whatever. None of us have to buy a game just because it's indie, or was developed at the Forge, or was written by someone who hangs out here. I don't own a copy of TSOY because it doesn't really interest me. Everyody says it's great, but I don't feel like I have to own it. And I don't feel bad about that. If someday I want to play a game that does what TSOY does then I may buy it.<br/><br/>There are enough of us producing enough different games that it's unreasonable to expect a person to buy or keep up with all of them. And why would you? Chances are you arn't going to like them all anyway.So many of us are designing for niche audiences now. So many of us are producing games that are targete not at the traditional gaming market but at other audiences entirely. At this point keeping up is like trying to see every movie that will be released this year; it's impossible, and you likely won't want to sit through half of them anyway. <br/><br/>"Do you hope to sell you're game? If so, how many copies do you hope to sell? How many people do you expect to play it?"<br/><br/>Yes. When Matt and I released Panty Explosion we hoped to sell about 200 copies. That was all we wanted. Since last August we've sold about 1400. It seems likely we'll do the same with Classroom Deathmatch. To me that seems like a lot. I have no idea how many people are playing the game. My best guess is that maybe 1/4 to 1/3 of the people who bought it have played it. I get a lot of emails saying stuff like "I really like the game, but I can't get any of my friends to play it with me".<br/><br/>Anyway, I think there are more and more games coming out like Panty Explosion, that arn't targeted at the gaming community at all and are instead looking for an audience in a different place. For PE it's anime and Japanese cinema fans that we're after. For Breaking the Ice and Shooting the Moon? I'm sure Emily had an audience in mind. Contenders? Best Friends? Cat? None of these seem to be targeted at the gaming market. Not really. It seems like that instead of trying to appeal to a limited and small group of people with preset tastes (gamers), a lot of designers are instead making games that will appeal to other audiences altogether. In that scenerio the potential market is much, much larger and much more free of competition then the gaming market. We also don't really have to worry about "oversaturating" the Story Game market, because there's no expectation that all of these games will appeal to the same auience.<br/><br/>Although I will admit, if you like traditional "gamer genres" (fantasy, sci-fi, pulp, etc) there is an overwhelming amount of good stuff available now. <br/><br/><br/>Jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78323/#Comment_78323" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T06:52:26+00:00" title="June 28, 2007  6:52AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Contenders?

I currently attempt (and, frankly, fail) to target non-gamers. I'm really bad at it. It seems like my audience is very small -- that is, mainly the subset of gamers or "former" gamers who are into and aware of indie games. <br/><br/>But, I do not think this is the whole of the potential audience. I also agree that the audience is probably much larger than we ever dreamed. We just have no means to tap that market.<br/><br/>No one I know has sufficient marketing, sufficient know-how, sufficient distribution (all while maintaining ownership), sufficient research, or sufficient resources (mainly money!) to reach a larger audience. Growth is slow and gradual, which is nice. It's grass roots. Also nice. But, it'd be hella nice to advertise in such-and-such media and <i>expect</i> a spike of 1,000 sales or 10,000 sales or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78349/#Comment_78349" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T08:05:40+00:00" title="June 28, 2007  8:05AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2007 8:06AM by eruditus.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            yeah, don't get me wrong, I so am enjoying what's out there but there was a time I could say "yeah, I own that and this is what my play experience was."  If you look at Fred's list of games being displayed by IPR and run as demos the ratio is way lower than in previous years.  Games on Demand is way cool but what's the chances of a GM being in house when a player says "I'd like to learn how to play Discordia or Alien Summit."<br/><br/>So there are three reasons I buy games.<br/>1.  To gain some insight on different design approaches.  To be informed about what's out there when considering how to handle my own games.  I plan on writing a new horror game based on Lovecraft later this year (based on conversations we've had here over CoC and GUMSHOE) and know that I will probably go in the direction of Heroes Banner.  I would have been reinventing the wheel or maybe not thought about that direction without HB in my brainpan.<br/><br/>2.  To play.  I like to be the guy that people come to and say "you've played this, right?  How is it?  What was you're experience?"  I could do that with well over 300 traditional RPGs and about 20 indie RPGs.  I could give folks an informed opinion.  Roger Ebert watches the lion share of films out there even though he may not like them.  Sure, I'm not getting paid to do it and thus you learn of my nuerosis but you get the idea.<br/><br/>3.  Because it's in print and it's purty or nostalgic.  I recently bought Aces &amp; Eights.  God, I would never play that game nowadays - okay, maybe I would but not during con season - but it was in a leatherette cover and a hefty 250+ pages.  I see Expedition to Undermountain.  Gosh it's aweful.  There are a few gems in there and for a trad D&amp;D player there are some useful tidbits to run a campaign off.  I bought it because I had the extra cash and I recall enjoying playing in the Undermountain as a 15 year old.  Wise?  No.  But hey, it's what I do.<br/><br/>I recently started finally shelving my game collection.  2/3 of it are shelved.  That 54 cubic foot of gaming books.  My buying slowed down dramatically since getting into the indie scene but once I could "collect" and play all these indie gems.  No more.<br/><br/>Again, I am not complaining nor do I hope to see it slow.  I do agree that I wonder how many of these games are really good as Graham mentioned.  How many of them measure up to Dogs or The Mountain Witch?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78351/#Comment_78351" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T08:14:27+00:00" title="June 28, 2007  8:14AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was asking about numbers because it's way harder to "saturate" a market when you're selling 150 books.

I'm really bad at it.</blockquote>\nMe too, but it's still good to try, right? Thi snice thing, I think, is that our games arn't going away. They'll be available for as long as we care to keep filling the orders. My hope is that if I keep pushing my games will eventually find their way to the right audience. A lot of us seem to be moving in that direction, but I think it's a slow process, y'know?\n<blockquote>It seems like my audience is very small -- that is, mainly the subset of gamers or "former" gamers who are into and aware of indie games.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><br/>But, I do not think this is the whole of the potential audience. I also agree that the audience is probably much larger than we ever dreamed. We just have no means to tap that market.</blockquote>\nRight. That's the audience we have now, which is a great bunch of people. But I know there's an audience for  both Dust Devils and panty Explosion (and tons of other games) beyond the one we have now. That just makes so much sense to me.\n<blockquote>No one I know has sufficient marketing, sufficient know-how, sufficient distribution (all while maintaining ownership), sufficient research, or sufficient resources (mainly money!) to reach a larger audience. Growth is slow and gradual, which is nice. It's grass roots. Also nice. But, it'd be hella nice to advertise in such-and-such media and expect a spike of 1,000 sales or 10,000 sales or whatever.</blockquote>\nI think the more we work at it individually the closer we'll each get to our ideal markets. Obviously what will work for one game might not work for another. In the mean time I agree. Slow and casual is nice. It's good enough for now.\n<blockquote>I was asking about numbers because it's way harder to "saturate" a market when you're selling 150 books.</blockquote>\nTrue. Even 1400 isn't really that many. I was kind of suprised by how many people at Go Play NW last weekend had never heard of Panty Explosion. The neat thing though is that while it is impossible to saturate the rpg market (or even this community) with 150 books,  by knowing who your audience is you can try to appel directly to them instead. If your making a game about... I don't know... Nascar racing, then you might recognize that your "marketing efforts"  might be better spent trying to appeal to Nascar fans then appealing to gamers. Of course you sti;ll want to let all those crosover gamer/nascar fans know about your game, but you want to reach for the bigger audience, right? The gazillion people who love nascar. It stands to reason that some of them might want to play your game. Especially if you package it to appeal to them and be accessable.\n<blockquote>I do recall the old horror stories of the early to late 90s about guys that lost their shirts trying to publish something. Now they were trying to do so in a mainstream model and self publishing is easier and cheaper than ever so that bar has come down tremendously.</blockquote>\nThank god. I did a panel with Christian and Travis brown a few months ago where I said that I thought the innovations in cheap and easy publishing (via the internet or POD or whatever) wher ethe most imortant things we've seen in the last 10 years. I really believe that, and I don't think we've even begun to see the potential. The class of 12 year olds I teach just published their first manga anthology. By themselves. With their hard work and pocket change. It's crazy. You blink fast and the world changes.\n<blockquote>As an aside I wonder if the little griping I have heard about indie production over the last year is due to some resentment from people that succeeded in the uphill battle of mass production and now may be bitter that there's an easier way.</blockquote>\nThere's likely something to that. Of course, it's always going to suck when you get there first with a led backpack and they give the late guy with the bag full of balloons the prize. \n<blockquote>If I was feeding my family based on my RPG output I'd be griping, too. I'd also be looking for a new job.</blockquote>\nTrue. I'm a full time freelancer, and I actually make more money off PE then I do off my freelancing. And I don't make that much money off of PE. And what I do make I split evenly with Matt. I'm always kind of amazed taht anyone makes a living in this business.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78764/#Comment_78764" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-29T11:49:09+00:00" title="June 29, 2007 11:49AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2007 11:49AM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jake richmond</cite>I'm always kind of amazed taht anyone makes a living in this business.</blockquote>\nMany of the ones I know have loving &amp; supporting (in the financial sense) spouses.
