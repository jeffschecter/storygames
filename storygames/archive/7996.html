I was lucky enough to have five people interested in playing, so I sat out and facilitated while the players designed the setting and characters.<br/><br/>The players were Joe, Debbie, and Adam, who I had gamed with before, plus John and Nathan whom we had just met.<br/><br/>The players rolled randomly to determine the type of dystopia that would constitute the setting, resulting in an Anti-Utopian / Capitalistic dystopia. Through discussion and use of the setting questionnaire it was determined that the characters all lived in a planned community, all inhabitants of which are employed by one of the two big car manufacturing companies that presumably have branched out and control the world. This led to some excellent and very colourful ideas, and I was particularly fond of the idea that Human Resources serves as some form of underground railroad and secret armed rebel organization, while Health and Safety are the closest thing to evil, no few of them simply being jackbooted thugs that do the Board of Managers' bidding. The only hope of escape lies with employment in the other company, which is really just a different flavour of bad.<br/><br/>Here are the protagonists and their Banes<br/><br/>Merton Finkley, Conflict Manager (Joe) - Bane: Richard from Health and Safety<br/><br/>Employee 43956, Assistant soup / stew technician (Debbie) - Bane: His Wife<br/><br/>Moonbeam Johnson, Graduate Intern (John) - Bane: Company Security<br/><br/>Janitor <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2326&amp;Mode=like">#26</a> (Nathan) - Bane: Poverty<br/><br/>Theodore J. Fredricks, Junior Accountant (Adam) - Bane: Money<br/><br/><br/>I like the mix of characters we had, and the differences in what they were facing - the sheer variety of Banes that popped up looks almost strange, but it worked very well in play.<br/><br/>I'll add more, and hopefully the players will add their impressions, in the next couple of days.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cthulahoops" title="cthulahoops"><img alt="cthulahoops" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cthulahoops">cthulahoops</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176835/#Comment_176835" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-30T17:55:28+00:00" title="October 30, 2008  5:55PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for running the game it was good fun.  I like the setup and would definitely like to try it again.  My only issue was that the game moved fairly slowly, it would have been nice to get to do more than a couple of scenes.  I think there were slightly too many players for the game really, particularly at a con where no one knows the system, which slowed things down again.  I suspect in a smaller group where everyone knew the system things would fly along at a nice pace.   The influences from Shock are pretty clear, but based only on a brief intro to both games, I preferred the Hammer Falls.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dice mechanics in particular were really nice, and added a lovely tactical element - after you roll you get to divide your dice between achieving your objective, avoiding damage, and having the initiative in the next scene.  Unless you are very lucky you aren't going to try to win all three.  I also really liked the introducing real hopes, screwing other players with hopes and the details of the banes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other thought is that it would be nice to have more opportunities to add to the stories other than that of you and your bane - maybe some sort of formalising of who plays NPCs.  I'm not sure specifically what, and this may be an issue to do with number of players again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pooka" title="Pooka"><img alt="Pooka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y136/pooka_fn0rd/appleb-1.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pooka">Pooka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176942/#Comment_176942" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T19:04:01+00:00" title="October 31, 2008  7:04PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam,<br/><br/>I agree completely about the speed of play, etc. One thing Gaelcon taught me that I will try to remember is "Never run a game for more than four players" as every game I GM'd or facilitated (or helped to do so) with 5 players underperformed in some fashion. (I also really think Grey Ranks deserves another shot, and plan on playing sometime soon just to see it in action with a more manageable number of players.)<br/><br/>I'm very glad you liked the die system. I also like the way you describe the three axes of success, in a way I never would - but totally accurate. I think I've involved tactical decisions with regard to the dice without <i>forcing</i> players to think tactically. It just remains to be seen how the dice stack up in the endgame, which is the big untested part of my system. <br/><br/>Hmm. Formalising NPC control? I have to admit, I felt the current system's method of offering control to a player didn't do so well - I have noticed that the offering mechanic works better when there are three players. Perhaps five allowed too much choice or defocussed the awareness of having a spare player. I don't know. Something to think about.<br/><br/>I'm curious as well that John had some concern over the way players push for conflict. In The Hammer Falls it's not unlike IAWA or Polaris in that the players narrate events as if their happening is taken for granted, until they cross a line the opposing player is unwilling to accept. I don't know if his problems with that were due to his relative newness to Story Games, or a design flaw. Did you find that difficult at all, or was it just something that required a bit of time to become accustomed to?<br/><br/>Oh, and thank you <i>very</i> much for organizing all the Indie Games timetables and planning the entire thing. I know we didn't really stick to the plans, but considering that we had four tables at one point it worked out pretty well, I think. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-Pooka                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cthulahoops" title="cthulahoops"><img alt="cthulahoops" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cthulahoops">cthulahoops</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176989/#Comment_176989" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-01T11:45:22+00:00" title="November  1, 2008 11:45AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think "Never player with more than four" is a bit strong, the ideal number does vary from game to game.   Inspectres was great with seven plus GM, great ork gods was fine with six plus GM and I think Roach suffered for other reasons.   But, yes, in general I'd rather have too few players than too many and I was really glad I limited IAWA to three plus GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the pushing for conflict thing is largely a problem of story game expectations, in particular as his fix was to suggest the need for a GM to define and push conflicts.  I think Hammer Falls probably suffers more from it than the Polaris or IAWA, because a lot of the excitement of creating a dystopia is thinking of all the wonderful pain that your character is going to suffer.  In this case, players are likely to be happy to fail, whereas the conflict system requires you to play to win, otherwise you'll never get conflict because the bane and protagonist are going in the same direction.   You have to trust the system and your bane to crush your character without your help.  I'm not sure if there's a simple design fix for this.  I suspect it's a matter of other players guiding and making suggestions - and also players getting used to each others expectations.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs regards the con as a whole, I was very happy with it.   I've been meaning to make a post, but the traditional post-Gaelcon bug has been leaving me pretty wiped this week.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdam.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pooka" title="Pooka"><img alt="Pooka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y136/pooka_fn0rd/appleb-1.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pooka">Pooka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177012/#Comment_177012" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-01T16:47:20+00:00" title="November  1, 2008  4:47PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I didn't mean that as a hard and fast rule. Just something to remind myself of, that for me in a convention setting, most games work best with four players at most.<br/><br/>Honestly, most people are so used to "acting as their character would act", particularly outside the SG milieu, that advocating for your character at one remove the way this game necessitates may be difficult. There needs to be real pushing by both Protagonist and Bane for positive and negative things respectively. I think the hard part is when the Bane makes a gambit and the Protagonist doesn't bite - instead accepting the narration. I don't know, I like the way this works in the game for the most part, but am maybe still waiting for a last piece to slot into place. It might be tied to NPC rules, but I can't be sure.<br/><br/>I'll have to be sure to give very explicit play advice in the final text.<br/><br/>Hope you're feeling better after the ConBug! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-Pooka                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
