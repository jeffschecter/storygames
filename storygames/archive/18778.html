While reading "DangerQuest" it hit me: is this really a roleplaying game? It rather looked to me like a simplified (nothing wrong with that) version of "<a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=168&amp;esem=1" rel="nofollow">elder sign</a>" by FFG, with "<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000_blank_white_cards" rel="nofollow">1000 blank white cards</a>" thrown in.<br/>I can sort of see how this can be a fun creativity blitz plus player interaction in the die rolling game part. But is it a roleplaying game? If yes then "Elder Sign" and "Betrayal at House on the Hill" are rolepaying games, too. Both games can feature colorful narration, too.<br/><br/>But before the rehash the same old positions and arguments, <b>let's reverse the first exclusive impulse and be a friendly inclusive dude</b>. Yes, of course: "dangerquest" is a rpg. And so is "elder sign", right? We don't have to exclude it only because some structures are more pregenerated. It's bit more railroady, that's all.<br/><br/>I could even make up roles "for cards against humanity" and say who plays the role (sic) can only give answers based on his role.

For that you sort of need analytic categories, and those won't work in don't even know what is in the domain of rpg and what not?\n<blockquote><br/>Anyway, you can add elements of playing a role to <i>any</i> game.

Other coop board games such a Pandemic, Battlestar Galactica and Fury of Dracula lend themselves to that treatment somewhat better however.<br/><br/>By the same token I've played plenty of role/story games in which the game tends to overpower the narrative. Personally, it's the problem I have with Our Last Best Hope and, to a lesser extent, Psi*Run.<br/><br/>Essentially I think there's just a massive grey area which is easy to overlook because 'this' is a story game and 'that' is a dice game. The rise of coop games in many ways got me back into RPGs and eventually story games, so personally I celebrate that ambiguity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421137/#Comment_421137" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-05T17:19:03+00:00" title="September  5, 2013  5:19PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One way of measuring it might be that in play all participants will (conciously or not) take tactically less efficient options, based merely on the spoken fiction of others (that or a win condition has been so watered down or beaten up that there's hardly any tactics to be had).<br/><br/>Even in this measure, you could actually do that in any boardgame.

This isn't "official" in that Ron doesn't really address the question as a matter of definition anywhere (for him it's good enough that roleplaying games are roleplaying games, I suppose), but it is an useful lemma for me, arising directly out of the theoretical framework. Like so:<br/><br/>A roleplaying game is a <i>game</i> (inherently implying a discussion of "what is a game?" - but I'll take that as a given for now) that utilizes the <i>Exploration</i> of <i>Shared Imagined Space</i> as a tool of play.<br/><br/>The above is very insightful if you understand the terminology (what "Exploring" a "SIS" means, that is), not the least because it shows this question in the correct light: we should not be asking whether something is a roleplaying game, but rather <i>how much</i> anything is a roleplaying game. As per that definition, we are not required to put anything in a clean box labeled "not a roleplaying game" or "is a roleplaying game"; we can just describe things in real terms: this game utilizes the SIS like so, this other one does it like this. This one game here is clearly not a roleplaying game because it doesn't care a whit about the SIS, while this other one is just a little bit of a roleplaying game, when played in this manner, because you can see how here in this part the players utilize the SIS in playing it. Ultimately: it's a roleplaying game in a given instance if Exploration of the SIS is happening, and the fact that the game they're supposedly playing is Chess or Monopoly doesn't change that bare fact about the activity - at most it'll make that use of the game exceptionally weird, and nothing more.<br/><br/>Another advantage of this definition is that it is functional: you can, in fact, analyze anything that fulfills that condition utilizing the tools of the rpg theory framework that definition comes from. So in that regard I can say that even if we agreed that the term "roleplaying game" meant something else, that would actually actively reduce the usefulness of the term, because then my theoretical understanding of what roleplaying is would not match with what I mean with the word itself. It just makes the most sense for me to use the term "roleplaying game" for the kind of object upon which my rpg theory applies itself. Just like literary theorists often call anything from movies to visual novels "texts" simply because they have all the properties of a "text" in their particular theoretical framework.<br/><br/>There are, of course, other philosophies on what a roleplaying game is. I used to give a talk on the subject matter, recognizing two other important ones aside from the Forge one; one was the Immersionist argument ("a roleplaying game is a game with character immersion"), the other was the traditionalist argument ("a roleplaying game is a game that shares in the cultural heritage or family attributes of the cultural phenomenon of roleplaying game"). It is delightful to figure out the liminal cases where these different conceptions produce contradictory results; you can fill out a Ven diagram of these three definitions and find examples of games that fulfill any subset of those three conditions, and thus illustrate the true richness of the gaming field, even if most of us will certainly find that at least some of those games are not roleplaying games in any way meaningful to them.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421140/#Comment_421140" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-05T17:47:09+00:00" title="September  5, 2013  5:47PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played with my seven years old son (I was just opening the box and we tried a first game while reading the rules) and I can tell you it scares the hell out of him !!!<br/>He's used to playing lots of games, but he felt this very differently.
