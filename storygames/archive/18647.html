I know people want to play Dungeon World and don't really know my game so the combo is good for me and them (because Assassin League is fun to!)<br/><br/>Anyway, I've written up a short gloss of the Dungeon World rules to use to teach the game fast.

Thanks!<br/><br/>So... I'm going to run him through a game but won't be able to do a campaign. I don't think he has played before but he's played D+D and what strikes me most about DW is that it runs like me and brothers always played that game. <br/><br/>I'll check out World of Dungeons.<br/><br/>I'm not certain about rolling damage. Doesn't the GM ask the players to do that? It seems also that you can just tell them damage. I prefer that method because I can use it to not kill players but make them hurt. This means they chose to stay and die if they don't flee a fight or get away since I tend to communicate something about the fight by how much damage is given each turn. Mainly I give only one of two points at a pop. <br/><br/>I'll add in "Ask provocative questions".<br/><br/>And after doing a training game I'll loan him my copy of the rules to read. I'm not certain that this will be the best way to teach the game though. I want to give him a concentrated dose of rules without over whelming him.<br/><br/>As to the hard moves - this is likely over emphasizing them but he will be running a very quick convention games so I think it is probably best to dive into the drama fast than to have a slow incomplete game. In a campaign game it makes sense to go much slower. I'm running a game on Indiana University campus now and see that they like to talk and not fight so I'm gearing the events to emphasize that.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418882/#Comment_418882" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-23T10:09:46+00:00" title="July 23, 2013 10:09AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rolling damage can fall to the players or the GM, and it uses the particular guidelines of what constitutes d4, d6, d8, d10 damage.<br/><br/>The reason I mention the hard moves is because you're only allowed to drop a hard move under certain circumstances: the players fail a roll, fail to respond to a lead-up soft move, or give the GM a golden opportunity. You can't just say "you take damage from the falling boulders"; you have to lead up with a soft move of "the room starts shaking and falling apart". If the players don't respond, deal damage (and don't flinch from handing out d6 or d8 damage! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> As the GM, you have to portray the world honestly), and if they do respond (probably Defy Danger), you only damage them under some circumstances.<br/><br/>What's more important than the hard moves (which are consequences of their actions or inactions) are the principles that you use to set up and drive forward situations. Things like "be a fan of the PCs" or "portray the world honestly" or "play to find out what happens". They're hard-coded into the rules because they do drive the game, and drive it quickly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418883/#Comment_418883" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-23T10:09:55+00:00" title="July 23, 2013 10:09AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I looked at the World of Dungeon pages and they don't quite work for me.

If the goal of drama is to fear random death then dealing bigger hits works but if the goal is to say "A bullet just pinged off the top of your helmet" or "You nearly got hurt there. They mean business." Then the drama is also real. If I give a bigger amount of hits it tells them about the danger of the monster they are meeting. Goons shouldn't kill you.<br/><br/>I feel I am running the game within the rules as written. They leave lots of blanks as to what constitutes the conversation. Really empowering of emergent play I think. They are a bit long though and the rules glosses are more than a page. I can't control what Josh does in his games but I want him to get the essence of staying with the flow more than worrying about what dice to roll, when. <br/><br/>I'm only an hour south of Indy so the reading while flying would work. I have to trust Josh to read the book on his own after having a good play session to see things in action. Like D+D this game probably teaches best by being seen done.<br/><br/>Of course this begs the question of what the rules say to do. My gloss shows what I think they allow so the feedback request is as much to see if my understanding is wrong, or as is more likely are there more than one way to interpret the rules?<br/><br/>To me the essence is a seamless flow of conversation.                           </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418930/#Comment_418930" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-23T20:15:44+00:00" title="July 23, 2013  8:15PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2013 8:17PM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There should be more damage-dealing, I feel.

Results like "a bullet pinged off your helmet" or "you nearly got hurt there" are either 10+ or 7-9 on Defy Danger, not really a GM move. Definitely not a hard move, IMO. Just my thoughts, anyhow.<br/><br/>You could also just average those dice. d4 turns into 2 damage, d6 turns into 3 damage, d8 turns into 4 damage, d10 turns into 5 damage.<br/><br/>Again, lean hard on the GM's principles, things like "Think dangerous", "Embrace the fantastic", and "Make a move that follows".

It worked wonderful. we just had a fully printed version of all character sheets, plus a sheet of basic moves. that is all you really need.<br/><br/>I say all the principals (sic) are just rough guidelines. Like any other GM section. Follow your GM instincts, use the experience you have from other games and you will be probably be just fine. World of Dungeons is so valuable because it captures the best parts of the move engine for play that Mr. Baker build. If you look closely at the document you find that its core is much less than a single page.<br/><br/>Don't sweat the story gaming metaphysics too much. I think in our con game there were no principles or "provocative questions". I think we played pretty traditionally,<br/>with just the difference that everything came from players making moves, and interpreting the stuff that was on our reference sheets. That really sufficed.<br/><br/>if you want more insight on interpreting die rolls, look at older discussions on this forums, or I especially recommend the "Dungeon Girls" actual play thread, which shows that you don't need any deep understanding of GM moves, principles or anything of the sort to engender wonderful creativity.

Be honest with the rules, and respect their choice to put themselves in continued danger.<br/><br/>If it's just a shakedown fight, or if you're thinking "I need to wear them down", then drop a goon fight and make something exciting or important happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418990/#Comment_418990" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-25T04:29:25+00:00" title="July 25, 2013  4:29AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> if you're thinking "I need to wear them down"</blockquote>\nNot really your job as GM to think this.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418996/#Comment_418996" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-25T06:28:22+00:00" title="July 25, 2013  6:28AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I say all the principals (sic) are just rough guidelines.</blockquote>\nNo, they're rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418998/#Comment_418998" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-25T06:58:48+00:00" title="July 25, 2013  6:58AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>WRT "Goons shouldn't kill you.":<br/><br/>The PCs have a lot of fictional options for avoiding damage.

It just wrote down what I already did. I always narrated and listened to player intentions with the occasional rolls (I usually based them off of an appropriate stat) and made the game a cooperative creation of players and GM. Once I realized that, running the game was easy. I like the player character move sheets because it makes the players the ones who are consulting rules sheets rather than me.

First we covered Fairy Tale Assassin League, which took around a half an hour. Fun game quick and easy to teach. You make a lot of shit up.<br/><br/>Learned that Josh has run D+D and Fiasco before so framing scenes and flowing with the fiction is not going to be a problem for him. He's also played other Indie games so he knows a good bit about the scene even though he hasn't played any of the world games before now.<br/><br/>Started off with him reading my one paged rules gloss, while I steped out for a minute. When I came back I had him explain the basics of the rules to me. He got that it is a conversation between players and GM. He got the idea that the GM moves are very like running a D+D game and that you challenge the players but don't overwhelm them. Next he looked over the principles sheet.<br/><br/>I had him build a fighter to see character creation even though at the con we'll use pre-gen characters. Then we played a quick session of the slave pit of drazhu. I showed by example how to get the flow going by not naming my moves then we talked about what I was doing so he could see the thought process. He was able to go through all the challenges but we cut out the last big fight since he had gotten the idea of the rules down. <br/><br/>Last but not least I lent his my copy of the rules book to read. <br/><br/>In the end he said he understood how to play. He said the game was a nice rules lite fantasy game. He liked it. Hopefully his work will not get in the way of being at Gen Con but if life gets in the way... Well being able to pay rent is more important than gaming.<br/><br/>So, the training went well. I think he will run a solid DW game after running a fun session of Assassin League.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419095/#Comment_419095" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-26T19:33:12+00:00" title="July 26, 2013  7:33PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main thing I'd check myself on is assumptions.

Set it at 100 or so hit points but that was to keep the fight going a while. Everyone got to make heroic flash while taking significant hits. The end defeat got twisted when the Chinese Dragon (a force for good - oops!) blew up like fireworks leaving a large cool dragon tattoo on fighter who delivered the killing blow. If it was a campaign that tat would real important. Fun session.<br/><br/>How could this work? Well the dragon had a couple of claws and a bit none of which were too powerful. I could five or six hits in a turn but by spreading hits around no-one was too close to death. Without giving the dragon a lot of hits the players couldn't feel quite as epic in dealing big cuts of damage.
