                    In the Leisure Games post elsewhere, I read with great delight that there was a retailer who was doing good business with indie games. <br/><br/>I had been thinking of doing a similar thing. Ann Arbor, a college town just north of here, Has lost a great game shop this year. My understanding is that it was a combination of outgrowing the hobby and getting to big to be fun anymore rather than lack of income.<br/><br/>I get the whole Indie press rewvolution thing, selling direct,  but was considering that a samll brick and mortar store might better encourage a geographically contiguous community for indie games. <br/><br/>What are the examples of other shops that have made some money with your games?                </div>

<p>There are several retailers who have made <em>some money</em> selling Indie games.</p>
<p>That's a distinct sub-question of the question "Can you make a <em>profit</em> with a business model that includes selling Indie games?"</p>
<p>I'm absolutely sure that the answer to that last one is "Yes" ... I mean, if your business model is to sell crack cocaine and Indie games (two great tastes that taste great together!) then you'll probably end up making enough gross income to defray your expenses (mostly, as I understand it, your peeps, bail money, and the cost of the caps you pop in the asses of Exalted players).</p>
<p>But if your business model is to pay rent on a big shop, stock it entirely with Indie Games, and hope that people come in any buy so much material that your profit will, month to month, pay the expenses of rent, utilities, insurance and some sort of wage for you and anyone else who works there?  That's a real dicey proposition.</p>
<p>Most successful RPG shops I know of actually sell (to my mind) the intangibles like friendship and community ... and then they turn that into cash when their customers buy bigs stacks of books "on a whim."  Have you got explicit plans in mind for how to create a space and a community that people will spend money to be part of?</p>
<p>I'm sorry if I sound negative about this:  by way of context, I have seen <em>two</em> pairs of friends (both married couples) do a great deal of damage to their finances because they started RPG stores (one brick and mortar, one web) and assumed that they could fill in the business plan at a later date.  I don't particularly want to see more casualties racked up to that particular avoidable mistake.</p>

<br/>
Business plan, business plan, business plan.  If you haven't already gone &amp; talked to your local SBA peeps, then I suggest doing that.  I had a great experience sitting down with a SBA councellor once.  In fact, it was about opening a brick &amp; mortar RPG shop.  I got two distinct vibes from that day, shit that's never left me;<br/>
<br/>
1)  Anyone with sufficient motivation and a respectable opening bankroll can be a successful small businessman.<br/>
<br/>
2)  If you want to be confident, successful, and awesome, then have a business plan.  Have a business plan.  Have a business plan.<br/>
<br/>
All that good shit still echoes in my head.   Here's wishing you more than luck;  I'm gonna wish for some awesomeness for you.<br/>

                            Actuall Tony that was exactly the business model I was thinknng about as well. The rent part is the part I was looking into. I have started and Burried a business because I failed to understand the profitability v. rent issue, however I was looking for examples of stores where this has gone right.                        </div>

                            Hey, Thor.<br/>
<br/>
The most viable gaming stores (let alone indie gaming stores) have other sources of income -- comics, books, or board and card games.  If you're serious about going into business, I'd consider this sort of thing.<br/>

                            That said, I know several stores (Endgame in Oakland, Leisure Games in London, Black Lion in Edinburgh) have successfully used indie games as a small but very steady revenue stream.  Where do you live?  If you could get knowledgable staff, you could have "demos on demand" which would be great for a game store.<br/>

                            Ben - all businesses are improved by multiple revenue streams.  I am assuming that there most retailers do not use indie games as a loss leader. I think that there is a way to build local knowledge of indie games and for location ecology to improve the situation for that retailer.  I'm not 100% there yet but to follow my  thinking look at something like a Model shop or a Paint ball store. <br/><br/>All of the model shops I have been in have been specialized in one way or another, but buy being strong on the intangibles they have built up a number of clients and those clients tell other who seek them out. <br/><br/>Paintball may be a better example. If I am a paintball store owner I need to develop a community of paintball enthusiasts to further my business and through the intangibles  then those people who play, I believe the term is, action pursuit games, will tell their friends how much fun they are having and they will come into the shop and pick up a set. <br/><br/>This is still in the pipedream stage but I am looking for success stories to find a place to look for best practices.                        </div>

                            I struck out at ever game store in Duluth yesterday looking for Dogs, so I don't know of any game stores that carry indie games in my area.  I've had a bit of experience in setting up retail stores and studying the competition in towns the chain I worked for was planning on moving into.  Ann Arbor was one of them BTW.  I'd do a couple of things before I worked up any concrete business plans:<br/>
<br/>
*Talk to the former owners of the game store in Ann Arbor to see how profitable they were.<br/>
*Study the competition and get actual real numbers from them without them knowing that I was planing on setting up a new store to compete with them.<br/>
*Do a intensive market study. This should be part of your business plan anyway.<br/>
<br/>
If you can find a nice hole-in-the-wall in Ann Arbor near the college with minimal rent, any game/comic store might be viable though.<br/>
<br/>
Edit: If I were going to open a game store and stock indie games, I'd set aside a 4' section that would display them.  The section would carry 10 to 15 of the best selling titles, I'd stock two or three deep if reorder was good.  I sign the hell out of them, and then spiff them for my sales crew for the first two months the store was open.  I'd markdown the ones not selling in the first three months and order the ones that do, and then keep trying other games to see which ones sell.  But this is just basic profitable retail.  So, I'd do that same on every product.                        </div>

                            To use an example of a business model I think is really effective, look at a Games Workshop store.<br/>
<br/>
They have big fricken tables in the centre of the store: one for fantasy gaming, one for sci-fi gaming, one for painting.<br/>
They have everything you will need set up. You can walk in and be given a Warhammer demo within a few moments (if the staff are good and not busy.)<br/>
<br/>
Like was said earlier, Most successful RPG shops I know of actually sell (to my mind) the intangibles like friendship and community .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I suddenly have this vision: a Gaming Centre, instead of a Gaming Store.<br/>
You walk in to see two tables, and someone ready to demo one of several games.<br/>
<br/>
You host game nights there.<br/>
A weekly Dogs night,<br/>
a weekly d&amp;d night...<br/>
<br/>
And you just ALSO happen to have shelves around the store, selling d20, indie, White Wolf...<br/>
some card and board games, some comics or whatever you choose to stock.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, I'd go to that store all the time, if I knew someone would be like, "Hey Joe... you haven't played Polaris yet have you?"<br/>
"No, no I haven't."<br/>
"Well, Jim here hasn't either. I could run a demo for you guys in about 5 if you were interested."<br/>
<br/>
I'd probably be keen if I had the time, and I'd probably walk away with a copy of Polaris.<br/>
<br/>
I dunno, that's teh store I'd want to shop at.                        </div>

                            The Games Workshop retail business model is: be willing to eat a lot of loss to produce some combination of customer service and exec-ego service.<br/>
<br/>
All games stores must have highly visible demo space. Or a lot of jigsaw puzzles, or both.<br/>
<br/>
Endgame in Oakland was basically thinking, our RPG shelves are just sitting there doing nothing; the whole category is virtually dying. How can we start nurturing something to get people excited about the category again? That's their whole purpose. They have a lot of other revenue streams that beat the hell out of RPGs as a whole. (Mostly minis and Magic I think. Maybe board games are bigger than Magic)                        </div>

<code><br/>I'd just like you to know that I am nominating you for Story Games Hero of the Day for looking in every game store in Duluth for Dogs. I just think that's cool.<br/></code><br/>Thanks, Tony. That's kind of you to say. It was our monthly trip to Duluth to buy groceries. Duluth is a two hour drive for us, so I figured that I better check every store while we were there.                        </div>

                            If I were to consider this, I think my concept would be "a cafe for creative people." The counter would sell coffee, smoothies, ice cream, and slices of pie and sandwiches. There would be a small bookshop area that sold indie games, indie comics, and select books, like Robert Fritz's Creating, Keith Johnstone's Impro, and Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way. The main area would be at least two semi-separate rooms of cafe tables, each with a couple clutches of carefully chosen lounge furniture. The walls would be decorated with indie comic art. And there would be nightly and monthly events. Poetry night. Impro night. Indie RPG night. Author readings. Dramatic readings. An annual indie RPG con. And an annual indie comic con. November would be focused on NaNoWriMo. April would be Game Chef month. There would be free wireless (but it might be turned off during events).<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I don't have any experience in food service. And that would be key to profitability.<br/>

I don't think I'd want to even THINK of opening this place up, unless there were a BIG university, more than one if possible, in town.<br/>

This kind of thing might be the thing that saves the small independent bookstore.                        </div>

<p>That's what assistant managers are for. Hire one that does.</p>
<p>I really like this vision of a shop.  Add in a section for zines also and maybe a 52 inch plasma tv that is hooked up to the web for special guests, cartoons, and make it interactive with Panasonics Retail TV system.  Maybe throw in some DIY goods, like Needles &amp; Pens in SF.</p>
