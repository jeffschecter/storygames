You can find prior discussions by searching for <b>[minis +] </b>at this site.)<br/><br/>Right away, I'm going to skip past some topics related to miniatures use, because they're found in those earlier threads, including the following:<br/>1) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"I don't like miniatures"</span><br/>I kinda don't care, honestly, and posting that in a thread labelled [minis +] is just a terrible threadcrap. You aren't normally a threadcrapper, so hold that sort of comment here, too.<br/>2) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using miniatures as inspiration for characters and adventures</span><br/>Synopsis: Work from what you do own, rather bemoaning what you don't own and it works better. Start from and use what you have, rather than trying to wedge stuff in backwards. It causes less friction with the verbally described stuff if you work it this way.<br/>3<span style="text-decoration: underline;">)"The logistics/money/time/skills of using minis is overwhelming and I don't really know how to approach it"<br/></span>I'm happy to offer suggestions and bring in other minis users, but let's handle that in a different thread.<br/><br/>Whew, now that's all out of the way...<br/><br/><b>I generally really dislike the way miniatures rules are written in RPGs, because they come from war gaming roots.<br/></b><br/><br/>It kind of makes them a pain in the ass, really. Usually using them tends to break the flow of Roleplaying, and not just from any set up and break down of maps and minis. It tends to break the flow because you go from playing pretty fast and loose, conversational play into this tactical subgame with measurements, and initiative, and well, all kinds of crap really.<br/><br/>In a miniatures wargame, that stuff exists for a pretty key reason: It's a game-game. It's competitive. It's generally head-to-head, and it's kinda-sorta hardcore gamism.<br/><br/>In RPGs, most of that doesn't apply, and even the gamism you sometimes see is largely more like, I dunno, softcore gamism.<br/><br/>And usually, all that kind of stuff is something that soaks up a big amount of game play time in a session, but not always in a happy way. It gets all slo-mo, but not in a good way.<br/><br/>So what's the alternative?<br/><br/><b>Doll Play.</b><br/><br/>Chances are good that if you dislike the war game style sub-mechanics, you're already doing more "doll-play", just minus the dolls ( minis).<br/><br/>If you've used the term "theater of the mind" to describe your gridless, loose-measurement approach to combat, you're half way there.<br/><br/>If you're using <i>Dungeon World </i>style of combat, you're basically there, you're just missing the miniatures.<br/><br/>If you're using <i>Dungeon World </i>style combat, have added minis, but have not altered DW's rules a bit, you are definitely doing Doll-Play. Congrats, go back to your coffee, you already know what you need to know.<br/><br/><b>The Big Mental Barrier</b>: <i>But if I use minis in an RPG, I <b>must</b> go to grid/measurement and war game style mechanics!<br/></i>.<br/><br/><br/>Nope.<br/><br/>Seriously...<i>Nope</i>.<br/><br/>Stop that line of thinking. Stop it right now. It's utter, what do the Brits say? Bollox. It's utter bollox.<br/><br/>It's completely unnecessary to go over to war game style mechanics.<br/><br/>Doll Play is nothing more than using gaming miniatures with a more Dungeon World style of approach to combat. That's it. That's all it is. Just like fictional positioning matters in DW, it matters with minis use, but the fictional positioning also includes, in the fiction, things suggested by the physical positioning of the minis and items on the map or terrain items if you're using 3d, wargame style, terrain.<br/><br/><br/><b>So why did I give it the name "Doll Play"?</b><br/><br/>Because it's essentially the same approach lots of people used to play with their dolls as a kid, whether they were action figures or breyer horses or smurfs or plushies, and long before they discovered war game style rules ( whether in RPGs or in actual miniatures wargames).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459979/#Comment_459979" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-06T15:08:37+00:00" title="February  6, 2017  3:08PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>What does this mean in practical terms for play at the table?</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spacing and movement is essentially flexible and relative, but the physical stuff is still, and importantly, part of the fiction</span><br/><br/>I've been playing for about a year in a D&amp;D 5E campaign. We use a grid on a wipe board for combats regularly, and we use minis as markers ( bleh, but that relates to some of the side discussions I've mentioned).<br/><br/>And yes, we use the movement rate rules and all the other stuff I've been railing against. I'm not the GM, the other players seem enamored of it and they're good guys, so, when in Rome, do as the Romans do, right?<br/><br/>That wipe board grid is about 24 x 16 or so. Whenever we end up in a combat, it's time to draw up the location. And worry about distances. And re-draw the next ( often nearby and attacked) location.<br/><br/>Meh. If the encounter location doesn't fit on the gridded area, we already have one problem.<br/><br/>I'm sure you've all encountered something similar if you've played in this fashion.<br/><br/><br/>So how would it differ based on a more Doll Play approach?<br/><br/>First, chuck the grid ( you can keep the wipe board if you like though). We don't need it.<br/><br/>Whatever space you have to play with the minis is the relevant space. Does it represent more space than the last encounter? Less?<br/><br/>Who cares? Doesn't matter. The space is relative. It's the same amount of real world space, but the fiction of the encounter set up determines what it represents. Usually this will be in the hands of the GM, per standard TOTM play.<br/><br/>If your mini is on the opposite end of the space from the baddies, you're far away. They closer the minis are, the closer and more immediately threatening the stuff is. If two minis aren't in direct contact, someone is going to make at least one move to make contact. Maybe several. The baddies may be out of range initially of ranged weapons, or specific ranged weapons. No biggie, just have the GM define it quickly, again, just like in TOTM verbal play.<br/><br/>Stuff in the encounter space (terrain) works the same way it would in TOTM play. Yeah, some things make it harder or more dangerous to move across, or block line of sight, just like in verbal only play.<br/><br/><i>How far can I move?</i> Again, works just like in verbal-only, TOTM play. Ask the question of the GM, get an answer, run with it.<br/><br/>IOW, it's basically the same way kids play with toys, using whatever space is available to represent whatever space their fiction demands, and movement rates and ranges are adjusted accordingly, all while play continues largely uninterrupted.<br/><br/>If that's still a bit befuddling for you ( it's been years since you played with toys and you've been using grids or measurements for a while), try this:<br/><br/>It isn't about actual distances, it's about how many movements it takes before direct, face to face, contact occurs.<br/><br/>What's the accurate range of a pistol or thrown weapon? Just slightly longer than one move by a normal, healthy human unimpeded by terrain factors, moving at a combat pace.<br/><br/>Everything else is relative to that.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NovanIV" title="NovanIV"><img alt="NovanIV" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NovanIV">NovanIV</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459984/#Comment_459984" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-06T15:36:39+00:00" title="February  6, 2017  3:36PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, you've gone a bit into the "how", but I am not really seeing the "why".<br/><br/>What value does this style of play add to my games?

Our D&amp;D campaign continues chugging along at a steady pace, and occasionally situations are illustrated with miniatures. However, the rules chassis we use is a decidedly non-miniatures strand of D&amp;D, with many elements that have specifically developed independently of any notion of using miniatures. This tends to highlight the true nature of miniatures use when we do use them, as they're definitely coming in as an addition and a tool, rather than the basis of play.<br/><br/>(Regarding practicalities: the most common type of "minis play" in our campaign is when there's a big fight in an architecturally complex area, such as a hallway with multiple relevant room entrances. I have been carrying one of those Chessex wipeable battlemats in my referee bag, so that's the board for illustrating such situations. I still don't have any markers for it for some reason, so I usually end up just laying out pencils and assorted knick-knacks to mark down the walls and doorways and whatever. Dice are nearly always the miniatures of choice, as they're plentiful, appropriately sized and come in a variety of colors. We have used actual miniatures, too, but only when playing at the house of one of the minis-hobbyists in the group.)<br/><br/>The one big observation I have about miniatures and miniatures gaming rules is that they are bad at accounting for reactive and ancillary movement of combatants. For our purposes, let's define the terms:<br/><br/><b>Tactical movement</b> is when a combatant moves to accomplish something, e.g. to close off a venue of retreat. <b>Ancillary movement</b> is when movement occurs as a natural part of some other action, e.g. while pressing a foe in melee. <b>Reactive movement</b> is when a combatant moves in reaction to something else happening in the battlespace, such as as a part of a defense.<br/><br/>Now, miniatures are all about fixed position, that's their nature. They thrive as a tool for tactical movement, because you can look at the battlespace and figure out where you want to be to do what you want to do. However, real combat is much more mobile than that, particularly the kind of skirmish combat that D&amp;D concerns itself with: melee combatants move as part of attack and defense naturally. A paradigm predicated on stationary playing pieces, moved turn-by-turn, will necessarily have difficulties with this.<br/><br/>An observation about miniatures-gaming rules: I believe that a big reason for the preference towards very short combat rounds in skirmish combat games is an effort at mitigating the inherent weaknesses of the miniatures-gaming paradigm. Consider 3rd edition D&amp;D, for a quintessential example: the 5-second rounds, opportunity attack and bull rush maneuver are an attempt at capturing a complex interaction with multiple active participants into a series of game-mechanical snapshots, all simply because the decision to use miniatures and precise positioning means that we have to know moment-to-moment where combatants are and why and how they move about. Unfortunately, while these formalisms attempt to explain why and when movement occurs in skirmish, they also serve to further curtail such movement into special exceptions.<br/><br/>This is a good place to point out that my issues aren't about "story vs. wargame" or anything like that; I consider D&amp;D a serious wargame in its own right. This is a simulation issue, and I have grave doubts about the efficacy of miniatures as a tool for capturing the dynamic details of small scale skirmish combat. The difficulties are so considerable that it is not uncommon for an abstract battlespace treatment (like in Final Fantasy and similar old school CRPGs) to be superior to a mediocre minis approach in tackling this issue.<br/><br/><b>However</b>, I believe that these sorts of issues brought about by miniatures are fixable, as Bob suggests. I am generally dissatisfied with minis combat rules I've seen, and often feel them to be disappointingly conservative in their game design thinking, but there's no reason in principle why one couldn't rethink the entire edifice to bring it more in line with the needs of a skirmish combat rpg like D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Here are some of the things we do when using minis to supplement the mental battlespace:<br/><b>*</b> The miniatures are not game rules, they are merely record-keeping and communication equipment. They are moved when the actual procedures of play indicate changes in battlespace, and they are moved to correct oversights. The movement of the miniatures itself is not a move of play, per se, any more than keeping initiative or hit point notes is.<br/><b>*</b> Movement speed is generally a non-factor between human combatants, because circumstantial tactical issues tend to impact speed much more than character encumbrance, longer legs, dexterity and other minutiae usually favoured in tactical rpgs. Instead, characters move farther when they have initiative, good visibility, even ground and a straight route to their destination.<br/><b>*</b> Game rounds do not track in-game time, they track in-game tactical decision-making loops. This means that distance, time and initiative are all interchangeable. For example, a character cannot really "fall short" of reaching an enemy on their turn due to movement issues, because the length of the charge is what defines that turn in the first place.<br/><b>*</b> Individual combat actions are not "attacks" in fictional terms, they are "bouts". This implies that every combat action has the tendency to shift the lines of engagement on the map, it comes part and parcel in the definition of what it means to be in melee. Character will in fact take defensive penalties for being pressed against a wall or (worse yet) a ravine due to the way this impacts normal defensive footwork.<br/><br/>I'm sure that much more could be done in the field, but as my own relationship to miniatures is quite casual, I haven't really put on my thinking hat regarding all this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459989/#Comment_459989" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-06T17:37:56+00:00" title="February  6, 2017  5:37PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            NovanIV, I won't presume to speak for komradebob, but for me, playing with miniatures evokes that ever-nebulous and subjective concept of "Fun." Part of it, I think, is simple tradition; miniatures are something "they" used to use, so I want to use them too (my older brothers had many of them, and they were a part of my early fascination with gaming). <br/><br/>I also enjoy, for all the talk of the power of imagination in roleplaying games, the concrete, visual aspect that miniatures provide; both for their value, as Eero suggests, in modeling complex spacial relationships to make them easier to understand, but also as a more abstract focus-directing tool. <br/><br/>I appreciate miniatures for being art, both of the sculptor and of the painter, and the way that they fall into the category of "folk art" and the way it ties into the whole tradition of gaming. A lot of the people I've gamed with have also been very creative people away from the table, and I like that those people have usually encouraged bringing outside creativity into their games. Someone here once used the term "Lonely Fun" to describe the parts of gaming that we can enjoy by ourselves, and I love that feeling when people bring their lonely fun to share with everyone else, making it far less lonely in the process. <br/><br/>I'm very fond of the physical accoutrements of gaming; not just optional fluffy ones, but anything that we use to play: character sheets, combat maps, dice, specialized decks of cards, the physical books themselves, dice bags, dice towers (actually I hate dice towers but I love that they exist), specialized gaming tables, GM's screens, and cetera. Sure, some games and playstyles actively seek to reduce or eliminate them as "extraneous" items that get in the way, but I feel like acknowledging their potentially inhibitive nature also implies the alternative, that they can enrich (or simply just alter) the gaming experience as well, even if it's in ways that may be subtle or hard to pin down.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459993/#Comment_459993" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-06T18:36:47+00:00" title="February  6, 2017  6:36PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yukamichi covers a bunch of what my answer would have been, and it also relates to some of those other, prior, threads I mentioned, NovanIV. I think the last post covers pretty much all of the "Why?" part of your question.\n<blockquote><br/>What value does this style of play add to my games?  Does it still add value if I use abstract tokens (with facing, if needed) instead? </blockquote>\nThat's still using miniatures mostly as markers. It certainly can help keep fictional positioning straight, but it doesn't do much for any aesthetics or inspiration you may draw from the visual elements for the fiction.\n<blockquote>Do you find that even with this style of play, the presence of the map still carries the implications that what is on the map is all that exists in the combat space?</blockquote>\nWith a map ( or terrain), I would say that implies the <i>major</i> items that exist in the fictional space, but not necessarily <i>everything</i> that exists.<br/><br/>I know that's a bit of a subtle difference, but maybe an example would help.<br/><br/>A bookshelf is marked on the map or with a terrain piece. It tells you a bookshelf is there.<br/><br/>It probably shows there are books on the shelf or strongly implies that.<br/><br/>It doesn't tell you what <i>specific</i> books are on the bookshelf.<br/><br/>Beyond that, it pretty much acts like theatre of the mind play. A player asks if some item of feature is present. Resolve the same way you would in theater of the mind play.<br/><br/>Did that cover it, or did you have something more specific( or a follow up question) in mind?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459994/#Comment_459994" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-06T18:58:37+00:00" title="February  6, 2017  6:58PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero:<br/><br/>Many of the things you're discussing are why I name-checked Dungeon World as an example of a different ( for my purposes, better) approach.<br/><br/>You know how I gave that weirdly specific, yet vague example of the range of a pistol/thrown weapon, for those who may be befuddled by the rest of my post? I suspect that ties into what you're talking about.<br/><br/>For everyone following along at home, let's say a common pair of minis using rules looks a bit like this:<br/><br/>A basic dude moves 6" ( 6 squares), assuming there's no modifiers involved.<br/>A pistol has a basic range (where it isn't taking penalties of some sort) of 7" (  7 squares)<br/><br/>If we wrote up rules like this, mostly the designer is saying: You can probably get a shot at a charging dude, with your pistol, before he makes hand-to-hand contact with you. If he's already close to you maybe not/probably not.<br/><br/>Okay, well, we could have probably just said this, or said it in another way, making some rule about initiative speeds, or final fire, or whatever. There are a bunch of ways to approach it. <br/><br/>And it's okay if everybody is using pistols or hand weapons. It probably works "okay" if our grid or play area is 24' x 16" and everybody starts on opposite sides.

Mostly when I have used a map and markers it has been in service of D&amp;D or the like.  Mostly the uses of terrain have been in respect to the rules of the game, sometimes certainly and unexpectedly, but still within the confines of their character abilities.  In those types of games, the only items they like to imagine that might be there that aren't shown on the map, are traps and loot.<br/><br/>I rarely got the sort of thing where I would draw a table, and they would ask if it had chairs.  In TotM, on the other hand, there's a stronger expectation (again, among people I play with) that the GM is giving incomplete info, beyond the aforementioned traps and loot, and thus I notice a lot more player invention, even if it mostly takes the form of leading questions "Are there chairs?" or assumptions that the GM hadn't actually confirmed "I grab one of the [unmentioned] chairs from the [mentioned] table!"<br/><br/>Again, since it has been a while, it could even be a growth/change of people who I play with that makes the difference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460002/#Comment_460002" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-06T20:01:57+00:00" title="February  6, 2017  8:01PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I think I see where you're going a bit.<br/><br/>If it was a wargamey approach and there were some forested spaces, they'd use the forested spaces on the map per the expected rules.

It works better if players ( including the GM) work with the limitations of the medium, rather than against the medium.<br/><br/>For example, miniatures play is pretty bad about <i>rapid</i> changes of location compared to verbal play (or verbal play+ quick sketches as needed/desired), especially  if the amount of space you have is limited to the traditional open space at the center of a table everyone is sitting around with all of their books and such.<br/><br/>There are different workarounds* for this, but none of them are going to be as quick as verbal only. So working with the limits of the medium in that regard means recognizing this and working with it. There are going to be down time, non-play, moments when changes from one significant location to another occur.<br/><br/>(* If you all want to discuss different sorts of workarounds, let me know and we can explore some further and brainstorm others)<br/><br/>_____________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/><b>A thought regarding the rhythm of doll-play and action/combat</b><br/><br/>This gets a little bit into what Eero was getting at, but since I thought a bit about it last night, I thought I'd share something that occurred to me.<br/><br/>When I was a kid, playing with my Star Wars action figures with my pals, there was lots of action, and combat, and derring-do as one might expect. In play though, there was a certain organically developed rhythm to it, that works a bit differently from a more formalized wargame style approach, even though both were kinda getting at the same thing.<br/><br/>Doll play sequence:<br/>1)The discussed fiction has created what would be an encounter situation in an RPG, and the dolls are in their initial positions. We all know action is about to start. Every participant knows roughly who "their"character is ( I'm Han and Chewbacca), and someone may or may not be playing the baddies, but of course, they're around.<br/><br/><i>Han, Luke, Chewie, and Ben need to sneak into the Imperial base, past the guards, and free the imprisoned rebel pilots. What they don't know is that in addition to the various storm troopers, several Bounty Hunters are due to arrive soon! What will happen?!?<br/></i><br/><br/>What happens next is a type of free play, but with what amounts to an organic "method", based mostly on our parents teaching us to take turns.<br/><br/>Everyone basically agrees on what is developing, up until something interesting is likely to happen, and the participants don't have agreement on it. Often, anticipating that happening, players already are following this next "slo-mo" rhythm even before they reach a point of ( potential) disagreement about the fiction.<br/><br/>Player describes action and/or intent of character &gt; Player begins moving doll to represent action&gt; player pauses before completing action and looks for agreement /disagreement from other players&gt; player completes action&gt; Move on to another player<br/><br/>Now by the organically developed method, it was <b>really very bad form </b>to skip the pause and look for agreement part or to continue going without looking for another player and seeing if they wanted to react, do something with their character, or maybe have the baddies do something related to what the first player was describing/showing.<br/><br/><i>So that method we used, it's pretty much exactly the approach Dungeon World uses, but adds the role of GM.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460027/#Comment_460027" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-07T14:53:16+00:00" title="February  7, 2017  2:53PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>An aspect of miniatures use almost never discussed in RPGs at all: Re-Use of the toys, and the fictional justifications and implications involved in re-use.</b><br/><br/>This next bit is going to touch on both economic considerations and rules considerations, as well as fictional considerations.<br/><br/>In childhood doll play, kids will re-use their dolls session to session, and significant character dolls in particular will retain their identity between sessions. This is largely because every session is at least a minimal "re-set" of the fiction, even if significant characters retain their identity each time.<br/><br/>In plain language, Darth Vader is going to show up again, even if for some reason he died last time you were playing with the action figures. It's a bit irrelevant when storm troopers get killed, because there's a whole bunch of them in the universe. Heck, if you only have a couple of storm trooper toys, they may get recycled multiple times <i>within</i> a play session!<br/><br/>With miniatures wargamers, much the same thing happens from game to game.<br/><br/>And then there's RPGs, and things get tricky when using miniatures (and liking their aesthetic value and the inspiration they provide for the fiction). <br/><br/>In particular it gets tricky with D&amp;D and similar games, where there's a whole lot of death of characters ( including especially major antagonistic NPCs and major monsters).<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This kind of thing rapidly runs up against some practicalities of time and money.<br/></span><br/>It isn't such a big deal where it comes to mook monsters, where pretty much everyone ever uses substitution. It doesn't matter a whole lot for nameless, faceless villager crowds scenes. All those bit players recycle easily. Heck, that's one of those times where, even with a decent collection ( okay absurdly large collection. Reaper kickstarters are crack to me), I <i>will </i>use temporary, non-miniature markers of some sort without a second thought. No problem!<br/><br/><br/>But then there's The Hydra. You own one. It was expensive as a model and you spent time and effort to make it all pretty. It's a boss fight in an adventure, and your players killed it dead! Yay!<br/><br/>In just pen and paper play, you've simply retired something that existed as a stat block and some fiction.<br/><br/>With miniatures, you still have the miniature. You're not going to simply retire the thing forever, or only use it with different groups, or for one-off, one-shot, battle scenarios. I mean, it's really rather a lot of time and money you've spent on the actual, physical toy. That would be a bit absurd, unless you are incredibly rich IRL and have other people doing the hobby stuff ( assembling, painting, storing) for you.<br/><br/>Since RPG related miniatures use rules pretty much only focus on the tactical combat, they never really tackle any of the broader issues of miniatures use at all.<br/><br/>Sine this post is longer than intended, I'll offer some suggestions regarding these issues in the next installment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460031/#Comment_460031" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-07T16:00:54+00:00" title="February  7, 2017  4:00PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>So, some thinking on the re-use of people/monster toys in RPGs, with a focus on D&amp;D and similar games, but with application to other genres too.</b><br/><br/><b>1) Substitute as much as you feel like when it comes to human sized miniatures and the minis are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nameless</span> mooks/hordes/ soldiers/villagers, etc.</b><br/>I think pretty much everyone already does this. Use some basic methods if you have big group scenes to help you identify for the players what is what. A simple common method would be something like needing 24 orcs, but you only own 6 in various poses/kit. Split the orcs up into the needed number of groups, and fill out each group with other, non-orc minis that are effectively armed/armored the same way or simply tell players , "Hey, those orcs are all armed like the actual orc mini, with bows, short swords, and leather armor". In play, take off the ones least "proper" first, moving minis around as necessary to accomplish this.<br/><br/><b>2) Consider creating some fictional reasons why different flavors of mook monsters are together</b><br/>When I got those Reaper Bones Kickstarters, I laughed at myself a bit, because I realized that while I had a huge collection of minis,  I really didn't have enough of any demi-human or humanoids of one sort to threaten anything but a small group of relatively inexperienced PCs in a D&amp;D type game. Naturally, I thought about point <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> above. It was practical, certainly. I also began thinking about fictional justifications, however. I considered declaring all humanoids "goblins" collectively, with individual families or tribes within that greater category, representing the more classic idea of kobolds vs. orcs. vs. bugbears, etc.  A "goblin" horde could then be almost any combo of humanoid races.<br/><br/>Of course, I also counted the classic demi-human races as also "goblins", but from families more likely to be neutral or friendly to humans. Humans generally stuck together, but individuals were more likely to become strongly "chaotic/goblin aligned" or strongly lawful aligned, while most were neutral or weakly "lawful".<br/><br/>IOW, it was fiction inspired by the toys collection I had available, justifying some of the mixes I intended to use anyway.<br/><br/><b>3) Unique human sized critters retain their personality until they're dead-dead or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">clearly</span> not present in what is going on at this location currently, at which point they cycle back in to the general mix of the pool of mook miniatures</b><br/>Roughly man-sized, roughly humanoid critters are the most likely ones to be used over and over as mooks. Sometimes though, you end up creating a meaningfully developed and competent character associated with a specific miniature ( and usually one that stands out in someway due to visual and physical aspects of the toy itself). For purposes of your sanity and the players' sanity, keep using that miniature as that character consistently. Essentially treat it like a monster or major character as described below. <b>Only </b>if that character is clearly not present in the scene ( possibly due to death-death in the fiction), should that character be used, and then only as a nameless, faceless mook, and preferably one of the first removed miniatures in those scenes thereafter, for the remainder of play ( like, the whole damn campaign, really).<br/><br/><b>4) Seriously consider curtailing the" monsters that exist and your world which the PCs will encounter and they could have problems with" list down to match your current/developing collection of miniatures.</b><br/>This follows from the ideas of <i>Use what you own </i>and <i>Let what you own inspire the fiction</i>. The PCs are going to be encountering stuff you have miniatures for ( or which make easy substitutions with attached fictional modification), even if other stuff exists in your setting. As you acquire more toys, you can always expand that list.<br/><br/><b>5) If there's only one of a given critter, or they only ever appear one at a time, they may be entirely unique and they're almost certainly a badass.</b><br/>If you only have one grizzly bear toy, if the PCs encounter it, you can rest assured that it's a badass, smart, dangerous, perhaps even somehow supernatural, grizzly bear who will likely have environmental/terrain stuff helping it. Some versions of D&amp;D let you really go to town making solo critters even badder ass for challenging PCs. Use that stuff. This probably also applies to monsters appearing in small numbers (1-3) that you have minis for.<br/><br/><b>6) Steal genre tropes from superhero comics for major monsters/villains/NPCs and create rules to support their recycling and/or create in-fiction reasons to justify their re-appearance or reasons why they cannot be killed-killed ( including supernatural or social reasons). These should probably also be applied to PCs for the time the owning players wish to continue using them.</b><br/><br/>When using miniatures, treat your major monsters like a writer of a comic book series treats major supervillains. No matter what the PCs do, they probably will pop back up again in the future, no matter how dead-dead they appeared to be.<br/><br/>Creating in-fiction reasons may help. Some monsters may be incredibly rare, but more than one does exist, just widely separated in time and space ( and likelihood of being encountered). I like this for dangerous beast type monsters, ones that are mostly just animals, if fantastic ones.<br/><br/>Maybe some of the critters are actually unique, but they're a bit like demons in some fiction. You can "kill" them, but eventually, they always reform, although it may take them an enormous amount of time to do so, and a lot of effort to come back into play in the setting. If that's the case, the PCs may well be aware of this.<br/><br/>They may be like supervillains in that they have escape plans that make them look dead, or nearly died but escaped anyway through luck or outside help, probably without PCs being aware of it initially.<br/><br/>There can be social/cultural reasons why PCs can't kill-kill a given monster, but only defeat it. Maybe there are cultural taboos about killing something entirely unique, or some kind of social rules in place for when you defeat such critters that even baddie creatures will largely follow. Again, PCs are likely aware of such social restrictions, and penalties for not following those customs.<br/><br/><br/>Put altogether, these kinds of methods maximize the use and re-use of the miniatures you own.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460033/#Comment_460033" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-07T16:49:19+00:00" title="February  7, 2017  4:49PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2017 4:54PM by komradebob.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>And, since I'm babbling and overcaffienated on my day off, an example of a game that did design in stuff to deal with the re-use issue that you probably don't know about...</b><br/><br/>There's a miniatures skirmish game named <i>GASLIGHT</i>, that's essentially a Victorian SF/ Steampunk game. Very generalized rules, very much what you'd expect mechanically from a miniatures war game coming out of the main line of miniatures war game development of the last fifty years or so.<br/><br/>One of it's supplement is named <i>To be Continued...By GASLIGHT</i>. This variation focusses down a bit from the roughly platoon/company scale (1:1 figure to troop ratio) of the parent game to a more demi-RPG scale.<br/><br/>The gist of it is, this supplement is for playing a series of linked games, with more heroic protagonists and their enemies, in the vein of an old style, serial, cliffhanger, movie series. Yes, just like the type Ozymandias references in Watchmen.<br/><br/>The thing will be played over 12 sessions, with each session being an episode of the serial. A session is roughly the equivalent of an RPG "encounter", but with usually a bit more going on than just a straight forward battle. There might be a bit of sneaking or social interaction or investigation in addition to the battle. Anyway, you get where this is broadly going.<br/><br/><b>Here's the method/mechanic that matters for the re-use of miniatures: <br/></b><i>No major characters can die-die, no matter what, until the 11th ( for important supporting characters, like key henchmen) or 12th ( any characters) session/episode/final reel</i>.<br/><br/>Sure, using those straight war game miniatures type rules, a character can be "killed" in a prior episode, but they aren't <i>dead-dead</i> if they're an important character. It's on the GM and/or thee players to decide how the character survived, and they're allowed to skip using that character in intervening episodes if the participants wish, bringing them back later as they see fit, right up until the 11th/12th episodes.<br/><br/>I've seen a similar mechanic used in another set of demi-RPG miniatures rules as well. In those, if a major protagonist/PC is killed, they essentially experience a "level drain" effect, and the player is required to come up with some colorful fiction explaining why the character survived and what has been happening to them since their last appearance. The character is then welcomed back into the game/campaign with the  equivalent of having lost a level of experience, to start playing again. Naturally, several "level losses" in a row may lead a player to choose to retire the character and start a new one, but by the style of play, this is considered perfectly acceptable.<br/>___________________________________________________________________________________________<br/>This is actually pretty important stuff if you're planning on using miniatures a whole lot in an RPG. It's also the kind of stuff that doesn't even get mentioned in the advice sections of RPGs with miniatures mechanics, however.<br/><br/><br/>Maybe a bit later, I'll post a bit about the other important toys, the ones that give us a sense of place for these events to occur.<br/><br/>I'm gonna skip talking about wipe boards. You all already know a number of advantages of using those (or even just big sheets of blank paper) to create encounter environments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460055/#Comment_460055" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-08T06:27:11+00:00" title="February  8, 2017  6:27AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Well, you've gone a bit into the "how", but I am not really seeing the "why".</blockquote>\nMore people should ask this question.

Check out the <a href="http://www.13thagesrd.com/combat-rules/" rel="nofollow">13th Age SRD section on combat</a> for a taste. Specifically, jump down to the "Positioning" section where the movement and positioning stuff starts.<br/><br/>The game plays well with miniatures! Since the movement rules are "move freely unless engaged or moving past an enemy," miniatures actually <i>improve</i> play. Without miniatures in 13th Age, there's actually less movement. With them, players know they can move around wherever, intercept people, block, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460119/#Comment_460119" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-10T17:32:32+00:00" title="February 10, 2017  5:32PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that a large part of the draw here is purely a love of miniatures, isn't it? Some people find that pictures or audio recordings really enhance their play, or are really into pretty dice. Similarly so for miniatures: I'm not a miniatures person, but I would imagine that a miniature fan might spend time, e.g. painting collected figures and daydreaming a bit about their history, where they came from, why they have that little thing on their belt, and so forth.<br/><br/>One idea, then, is that a miniatures-based game would leverage that. Perhaps character creation would consist of painting a miniature, for instance, with certain colours or techniques being used to highlight aspects of the miniature. Maybe drawing blood on a drawn blade gives the resulting character the "Bloodthirsty" trait. Or maybe once you're done each other player asks a question based on your work, and that creates a bit of backstory for the character.<br/><br/>I wonder if you're familiar with the Lego Mecha-fighting game that Vincent Baker wrote? I think it's called "Mobile Frame: Zero", but it's gone through a few different titles, if I recall correctly. It has interesting rules for building your "robot" from Lego bits, and then those bits affecting its abilities in combat.<br/><br/>I also think that an interesting miniatures game should foster one or the other of these criteria:<br/><br/>* The game encourages you to collect and paint miniatures. Building up your collection is something you do to expand and enrich your play; bringing new miniatures interacts with opening up new areas of play. For example, maybe your campaign world has a "desert" continent, but no one can travel there until players bring appropriate miniatures to the game.<br/><br/>* The opposite: the game is built to thrive on a limited set of miniatures, and recycling them.<br/><br/>I don't know if you've ever played In a Wicked Age..., but that game creates arbitrary combinations of characters to tell stories in a consistent world, fleshing it out from different directions.<br/><br/>Miniatures would be a fun and different way to create such random combinations. For instance, imagine reaching into a bag of minis to pull out some kind of "setting piece" (the wall of a barn) and then three "characters" (a wolf, a young girl, and an alien), and then having to describe a scene (or whole episode/story) with those constraints.<br/><br/>As minis get shuffled back into the bag and drawn again, you get recurring characters and plotlines. The wolf appears again in a hospital setting, and you find out that it was created several years earlier as a part of a weird scientific experiment in a secret government laboratory. This explains why it behaved unlike a normal wolf in your previous session, and fills in its backstory.<br/><br/>That kind of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460131/#Comment_460131" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-11T14:04:09+00:00" title="February 11, 2017  2:04PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam: Thank you for the link. I have been hearing a lot of good things about 13th Age. I didn't realize there was an SRD, so much appreciated! I haven't looked at it yet, but I'm always up for stealing great concepts!<br/><br/>Paul: Jeez, all kinds of great idea there!<br/><br/>For me, you are dead on about the way the miniature ( and painting it, and how it's equipped) all play into what I mean about inspiring fiction later.<br/><br/>As for the Lego stuff, I've talked to several Lego fans ( and I have a big Lego fan in my weekly D&amp;D campaign), and they've had some great ideas along those lines. I haven't explored that end, but only because I've never really owned Lego blocks, even as a kid. I suspect strongly that there's a whole world of methods Lego fans could come up with that would be pretty wonderful.<br/><br/>On the other stuff:\n<blockquote>I also think that an interesting miniatures game should foster one or the other of these criteria:<br/><br/>* The game encourages you to collect and paint miniatures.

Sadly, it's probably the harder one to do. The big barrier is really a financial one, and it's especially pronounced in a D&amp;D-like game, with lots of variety in characters, areas, and monster types. Some of the recycling/re-use stuff I was going on about a couple of posts ago really is about these issues.<br/><br/>I think, even in the context of players liking minis, a game would need to include some kind of reason that players other than the GM would be encouraged to buy/paint/provide minis, to create that effect. I'm not really sure how to encourage non-GM players to buy stuff that would very likely end up representing dangers to their characters.<br/><br/>Someone more clever than myself could probably come up with a method or mechanic so that" providing minis of opposition also provides unlocks of opportunity for your character(s)".

It wouldn't be hard to come up with some other method of determining ( randomly) the important characters, however.<br/><br/>It would also be a great concept for people starting out with just a minimum of miniatures, then building up a collection further over time.<br/><br/>____________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>Following up a bit on that last thought, from some conversations here and elsewhere, I had some ideas on what the easiest to plunge into genres might be, for people who want to use minis, but who are just getting started.<br/><br/>Now, the really real answer is always gong to be...the genre you already have access to miniatures ( and toys) for.<br/><br/>After that though, these two seem ( to me) to be winners, provided you're a bit of a self starter.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1) A modern monster hunter setting, along the lines of the TV Show <i>Supernatural<br/></i> or the RPG <i>Monster of the Week</i>.</span><br/>a) Lots of inexpensive, pre-painted Heroclix miniatures are available from online sellers like Troll and Toad. Usually, the "supporting" characters from superhero comics are cheap ( often around $0.50 each) and relatively generic modern people, so it hits the re-use concept. Many of the "monsters" faced are things that are basically human in appearance, unless you see them up close, so that isn't a problem. And sometimes there are even named superheroes/villains that can quickly sub in for monster types, also equally inexpensive, so it is easy to add in one vampire, one werewolf, one gill man, one killer robot, a single alien, a ghost, etc, for just a couple of bucks more if you're getting started and buying in bulk.<br/><br/>b) Unpainted, generic. model railroad people exist and you can buy them in huge numbers on e-bay for cheap, usually from Chinese companies. I think you want about O-Scale ( either 1/56 or 1/48 in model scale. They'll be a little off from gaming minis scale, but who cares?) but double check with someone who knows their way around Model RR. Grab a gob of these and paint them in a variety of ways. Now you have even more innocent bystanders/victims/random NPCs/zombie hordes as needed.<br/><br/>c) Terrain and/or maps are pretty generic. A ton of Supernatural episodes essentially involve Small-Town USA. With about 10-20 decent sized tiles of classic encounter spaces or parts to throw them together quickly, you're pretty much covered. As a GM, you can make special maps/terrain for a given adventure, but you've got a whole lot of recycle-ability for not too much expense. Much easier than a very dense urban environment certainly.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A post-apocalypse setting, with a <i>Gamma World</i>-ish bend.</span><br/>a) You can use whatever minis you feel like, so cheap sales ( either as above, with' Clix) or from e-bay or trade/sales sites like Bartertown. Fantasy or modern minis are easy to convert with the addition of modern/scifi equipment from bits sellers or you local minis-head's bitz box.<br/><br/>b) Mutations mean that any weird critter is justified. A little paint job makes plastic farm animals or zoo animals dangerous mutants. Ditto trees. Never trust plants in Gamma World! And, because of mutation, any single miniature could potentially be a threat to challenge an entire party. Don't forget swarms either. Often you can find bags of tiny plastic ants, spiders, or flies for about a buck per bag.<br/><br/>c) Everything is in ruins and nature ( of some sort) is reclaiming the former civilized areas that are in ruins. Again, really easy to create on a limited budget of time and money. Plus, your recycling bin becomes your friend. All that weird plastic packaging you were going to send to recycling? Yeah, an exact-o knife and some paint, a bit of glue to mash stuff together and you've got a ton of futuristic ruin or settlement buildings.<br/><br/>d) likewise, vehicles and other toys from the dollar store or thrift store, plus paint and glue, give you pretty much all sorts of killer tank-bots and so on as needed.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460147/#Comment_460147" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-11T22:33:06+00:00" title="February 11, 2017 10:33PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Someone more clever than myself could probably come up with a method or mechanic so that" providing minis of opposition also provides unlocks of opportunity for your character(s)".

Sounds very doable.<br/><br/>For example, in a game fighty leveling-up game, you might need to bring adversaries to the game. Doing so allows you to have some say as to what you fight (which could be advantageous to you).<br/><br/>Imagine a D&amp;D-style game, where the average enemy is too hard to defeat, but your character has particular strengths. You could bring "enemy" minis suited to those strengths, which would allow you, perhaps, to dictate one feature an enemy has (and one it does not). The GM fills in the blanks, so as to surprise you sometims. <br/><br/>Likewise, you could have a rule where introducing a mini to the game (an opponent) gives you the right to determine what treasure or reward is at stake. Maybe fighting wolf-people allows you to increase your Wilderness skills, but Gnomes always have platinum treasure.<br/><br/>Similar for terrain:<br/><br/>When you bring a terrain to the game, explain how your character is "familiar" with that terrain. You get a bonus when maneuvering in it.<br/><br/>Of course, you could get more creative; these are just the obvious first things to try!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460156/#Comment_460156" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-12T13:18:14+00:00" title="February 12, 2017  1:18PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See, now that's much cooler than my vague thoughts about a better XP value of critters if someone other than the GM brought them into the overall collection.<br/><br/>Anybody who wants to help brainstorm the stuff Paul is talking about, please post here with your concepts, no matter how basic they are.

It's almost enough on its own.<br/><br/>Players bring forth miniatures they would like to be used in the game. In exchange, they are allowed to specify things about them: "Look, here's a Storm Giant figurine! Please add that as an enemy for us to face. What we know about Storm Giants is that they have a vulnerability to fire. We also know they often keep magical shields."<br/><br/>Then you, as the GM, place them in your prep somehow. (It could even be fun to write up an "adventure" or locale with placeholders for certain enemies or factions ("At 12:00, Monster B shows up with several Monsters C in chains..."), and then slot in the figurines the players bring to you. You can also add a twist ("But this Storm Giant is undead!"), perhaps, if your prep doesn't already indicate it.<br/><br/>I think it would be cool to show up at the game and then see a warlock (figurine brought by your friend Liza) maneuvering around a pet Storm Giant in chains (your figurine), and some sense of what dangers and rewards they represent (but not all of the above!).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460180/#Comment_460180" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-13T13:53:24+00:00" title="February 13, 2017  1:53PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if players <i>take turns</i> being the GM for a session and treating the others to an adventure?

Apologies, Rafu.<br/><br/>There is some basis for this kind of thing happening with a subset of miniatures war gamers. I need to explain by way of a contrast.<br/>______________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/><b>The likely most visible (and commercially successful)approach to war gaming you'll see at game shops and conventions:<br/><i>The Collect Your Own Army Approach</i>.</b><br/><br/>This is thee Games Workshop approach, and other companies have imitated it. Some companies have done quite well. Here everyone collects their own personal army, and you play against other players with their own army. Usually you'll use club or game shop resources for your table toys/terrain. Sometimes, in the case of games with pre-painted miniatures of different sorts, you'll be using maps or tiles instead, and those will be  sold either in starter packs or separately, designed for the game itself. The various Collectible Miniatures Games work like this.<br/><br/>You know how D&amp;D seemingly casts its shadow over all RPG discussions? This approach (and its success) tends to cast its shadow over all miniatures gaming discussions.<br/><br/><b>The Less-Seen approach, unless you're really hanging out with some aged geezers:<br/><i>The Gaming Grognard approach</i></b><br/><br/>This is closer to what you're talking about, Rafu. It tends to happen in game clubs and slop over into conventions.<br/><br/>In this one, everyone has their own <i>Thing</i>. That Thing is a combo of time period, theater of war, genre, scale, and so on. Usually, that one person collects all kinds of stuff for their Thing, then encourages others to participate in that Thing by putting on club meet up or convention scenarios.<br/><br/>When they aren't doing their Thing, they're players in someone else's Thing.<br/><br/>Sometimes, a couple or a few people's Things are somewhat compatible, and you'll see some cross-borrowing of toys between people. For example, if I want to do a Raid on Innsmouth scenario with 28mm miniatures, and I have a good buddy who plays WW1 in 28mm and has some Americans handy, I may try to borrow them for my scenario when I present it at the convention or club meet up.<br/><br/>Sometimes, if I get very lucky, I'll have someone in one of those games, and they decide they want to jump in a little bit, they'll go out and buy a small amount of toys for whatever I'm doing already. Sometimes if I get lucky a few people will slowly join in. Then we almost have a club within a club. Say we've been doing an Old West setting and one of the players noes a decided lack of Mexican Banditos. They might buy a gang of banditos, mostly for their own use, but also because they're a staple of the genre that wasn't represented yet.<br/><br/>In any case, it's all very informal.<br/><br/>To some extent, I suspect that any gamers who would want to play an RPG with miniatures ( beyond their value as positional markers) would probably inherently tend towards this method anyway. I'm partly trying to figure out ways to encourage it faster.<br/><br/>A bunch of the up-thread conversations about "unlocking" fiction or rewards has to do with that.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460219/#Comment_460219" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-14T14:49:51+00:00" title="February 14, 2017  2:49PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>A bit curious about the range bands concept...</b><br/><br/>So, I started looking through the 13th Age rules Adam linked upthread, and I'm a bit torn on the concept.

Specifically, I mean that while it is well and good to speculate about possible approaches, I'm more of a mission-based thinker myself, which leaves me floundering a bit when it comes to general discourse on a topic like this. Everything that's been said is well and good for some <i>specific</i> game design, but before I get that far I'd need to figure out how a subject matter, and a material substrate of gaming tools might connect together.<br/><br/>I find that I rarely get very far into miniatures-land in the course of my natural gaming, and that's precisely because it's such a chore to prep the toys. To get over that hump I don't really feel like I need clever rules as much as an overpowering vision of a game that integrally needs to be done with minis. The rules bit is easy, I think, relatively speaking.<br/><br/>What Novan said earlier about abstract markers plays into this as well. Aside from the fairy tale game I specifically designed for minis use (I told you about that earlier), the one game that's actually gotten me to consider using miniatures has been Dungeons &amp; Dragons 4th edition. However, my ultimately conclusion upon that: the superior physical tools method is to have minis for the player characters while the GM uses abstract markers for the monsters. The bother of going fully minis-using is simply not justified for a game even remotely akin to D&amp;D.<br/><br/>(Do note that my conclusion was also that miniatures <i>could</i> be worth it for a 4th edition campaign for the player characters. You'd be looking at those characters for a long time, after all, so why not give them distinctive playing pieces.)<br/><br/>As a further datapoint on "how to entice roleplayers to use miniatures" I'll say that my favourite minis games are always the constrained, specific ones that feature a very limited, predictable amount of miniatures. I've never <i>really</i> gotten into the hobby, but I've played enough to know what I like, and if I <i>did</i> start on something, it would a game like <i>Bloodbowl</i> or <i>Space Hulk</i>: something with a discrete, limited set of miniatures, where you could expect to "finish" the crafting phase at some point instead of being stuck from here to eternity painting little tin soldiers to fulfill an ever-expansive need.<br/><br/>I hope you're not confused by the way I'm approaching this discussion, Bob - it might seem that I'm meandering wildly, but it's because the topic is so extensive and you're clearly just gathering ideas. I don't intend to critique the idea of using miniatures here, I'm just exploring my own creative feelings over them. It's tricky, but it's also clearly a field that can be improved upon.<br/><br/>Another angle that might be interesting to consider is that I am actually pretty active about crafting for game prep when a real concordance of creative needs and creative tools occurs; one cannot say that it would be hopeless to get me to make an effort. For example, here are some games around which I've done various sorts of crafting over the last few years:<br/><b>*</b> I'm planning an <i>Ars Magica</i> campaign where I begin by translating the rules into Finnish (with house rules integrated, of course), and lay them out in a way that enables the group to construct grimoires, with appropriate book-binding methods to get from loose leafs to books. The goal is to have player-specific, customizable, compact rules-references, that also act as spell books and character stables for the individual players. So apparently I'm willing to create actual books as artefacts if I perceive the game-play to benefit from that.<br/><b>*</b> My version of <i>Paranoia</i> involves player screens (like a GM screen, except everybody gets their own) that function as character sheets; personal notepads for each player; personalized newsletters the GM writes for the players for each session of play; character displays for important NPCs.<br/><b>*</b> I totally play <i>Puppetland</i> with actual puppets. It's a powerful game with an unique feel, no difficulty whatsoever with motivating me to concretize it this way. The GM preps the puppets, and whichever the players don't pick get to be NPC cast alongside a few puppets specifically reserved for specific NPC roles, such as Punch and Judy.<br/><b>*</b> Apparently I won't prep miniatures for D&amp;D, but I will prep maps, price lists, encounter tables, fictional languages, tables of organization and whatever else. In fact, thinking about it, physical props are just about the only thing I won't prep, and this presumably has to do with the re-use problem: just about everything else I prep is either essentially permanently useful, or reasonably easy to make for a one-use purpose.<br/><br/>From a certain viewpoint, the question is not how the rules should be crafted for the miniatures; the question is, what is the form of the game that <i>both</i> impresses me with its creative vision and integrated miniatures to such a degree that I'll actually start buying or making them for the game. The above examples are <i>all</i> games where I've rejiggered the actual rules to whatever extent to make them my own; it's not the rules that convinced me to go to the effort of craftsman-like game prep.<br/><br/>And what's the lesson with <i>Puppetland</i> there? I mean, that's apparently a game that takes me over the edge when it comes to toy-prepping. It's clearly doing something right (or wrong, I suppose), because when it comes to Puppetland I <i>don't</i> feel like prepping the toys is a waste of time. A few features occur to me as explanations:<br/><b>*</b> Artistically provocative, aesthetically dense scenario that encourages the GM to put in the presentation effort for the sake of atmosphere.<br/><b>*</b> Very enclosed scenario; however long the campaign takes, it'll be about these particular characters in this particular place.<br/><b>*</b> Interesting, ambitious rules that make the game different and a change of pace from other rpgs.<br/><b>*</b> The toy-prepping is loose enough and compact enough that it's entirely realistic to get into it without taking toy-making or collecting as a hobby - we're talking of 10-20 hours max to pimp out your Puppetland. Just root through some child's toybox or several, collect a pleasing selection of old junk dolls, perhaps sew up a couple, and get to it. You're only going to use the single set once, and as the play process actually destroys dolls, you don't want to think of them as a permanent collection anyway.<br/><br/>So yeah, I'll boil that down into a concrete hint for Bob: apparently, if your game presents a few impressive NPCs and suggests that hey, you're going to be playing these guys a lot, so why not prep some illustrations or dolls or something for them - I'm apparently going to do that. But it's going to take <i>genuine</i> character focus, you can't fake that. I want that NPC to be fucking central to the proceedings, the way e.g. Punch is to Puppetland. If it's just one adventure and that's it, I'm not going to bother - it's just like D&amp;D all over again, where you use that stone golem figure once and that's it.<br/><br/><i>Puppetland</i>, really - why haven't we talked about that? Thinking on it, it's exactly like the miniatures-based story game game that Bob's been speculating about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460222/#Comment_460222" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-14T16:02:38+00:00" title="February 14, 2017  4:02PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2017 4:20PM by komradebob.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>And, so, I said I was going to talk about terrain toys...</b><br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Let's get one out of the way, right away: various erasable surfaces</span></b><br/>This is easily the most practical. You can figure out the usual size of surface space you have in your home game and acquire something that fits with that. They're flat, they generally don't weigh much ( ease of transport and storage), and generally aren't too expensive, especially if you aren't buying a gridded one made with gaming in mind. The only real long-term cost is the markers.<br/><br/>They have high re-use ( obviously) and the time to draw an area of action for a scene is pretty quick. Clearing them and drawing the next location isn't terribly hard, and is a good excuse for a brief game break anyway.<br/><br/>The only real downside is that they don't do much for the aesthetic/fiction inspiration part that I like about minis. To bump that aspect up just a little bit, it would be fairly easy to use small bits of "spot"* terrain, whether 3D or 2D like tiles of the sort WotC sold for a while when promoting minis use with their versions of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>* Spot terrain is what I call all of those little bits of stuff you add to a bigger encounter area to make it interesting: A treasure pile, a fire pit, a mushroom cluster, a fireplace, some stairs, etc. which don't take up a huge amount of space.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Printed/Printable surfaces with art work</span></b><br/><br/>A lot of this stuff is a nice mid-point, with some aesthetic joy, but still relatively low-cost and easily transported. You can buy it pre-made or find lots of tiles and similar from download sites. WotC made a bunch for D&amp;D and you can find tons at DrivethruRPG, and sometimes online for free.<br/><br/>Ease of use is harder to gauge, depending on how you use it.<br/><br/>If you have a pre-printed encounter space that covers everything you'll need, it's slightly quicker than a wipe-board change of location. If you're using multiple tiles and lots of spot terrain added to it, it takes longer. If the spot terrain is also made of printed stuff, it can get knocked around and out of position easily just in the normal course of play. And, of course, there's the out of game aspects of printing and mounting it, and getting it together and organized for ease of use at the game session.<br/><br/>For transport, even printed at home and mounted on poster board or foam core, it's pretty simple to transport.<br/><br/>It's also pretty easy to pair with spot 3D terrain, for a nice mid-way point between 2D and full-on war gamer style 3D terrain, which can help keep budgets more reasonable if you're building up to 3D over time.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Re-Use and General Purpose/Generic vs. Location Specific</span><br/><br/>You will probably want both.<br/><br/>Generic would be a lot like those sets WotC sold under the <i>Dungeon Tiles Master Set </i>line. They're themed kits ( dungeon, town, wilderness, etc) and come with a few larger tiles and a good bit of spot terrain.<br/><br/>Location Specific would be more like the Pathfinder Flip Mats line or their encounter tile sets.<br/><br/>Both types are made by other companies, and, again, lots are downloadable at places like DrivethruRPG. Some of them are modifiable thru Adobe Reader layers, so you can customize them when printing ( Fat Dragon's E-Z line is like this). <br/><br/>On the whole, generic have more re-use potential, but take longer to deploy in game time, since they'll  likely be modified each time by placement of spot terrain.<br/><br/>Location Specific ones may or may not get re-use. While the obvious ( to me anyway) use is for a specific planned encounter location as a special treat for the group, there may be another (slightly different) use, and that depends a bit on a design/play style consideration.  <br/><br/>I'll get into that in a bit.<br/><br/><br/><b>Before I go on to that, the one thing I would NOT do (ever again...) with wipe boards, 2D terrain, and definitely not with 3D terrain...</b><br/><br/>I would never try to do an old school dungeon exploration and mapping with the terrain toys.<br/><br/>Seriously, it's an utter pain in the ass for not a whole lot of gain. And no, I really don't like things like Castle Ravenloft for a similar reason ( although Betrayal at the House on the Hill is okay).<br/><br/>Going from key location to key location is kinda-sorta okay, and you can feasibly pair that with old style dungeon mapping on graph paper.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460223/#Comment_460223" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-14T16:57:59+00:00" title="February 14, 2017  4:57PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, I pretty much agree with all of that.<br/><br/>Somewhere in the initial set up, there needs to be constraints and vision for what the thing is going to be mostly about, and what is going to be needed, and how much everyone is going to contribute. Pretty much what you were talking about with regard to prepping for Puppetland, but with minis.<br/><br/>You're going to want an idea of what you'll need initially to have some pretty good long term play ( although I'm not against small additions here and there as the campaign develops, but that's more like small expansion rather than the core of the thing), and it needs to not be too onerous and players need an initial idea of what that will be. <br/><br/>Bloodbowl ( or other skirmish games like Mordheim) does that well. I'll need roughly a gang or team of X many  miniatures, and that number is relatively low. ( I'd throw other sorts of terrain toys in the mix as well).<br/><br/>Really, D&amp;D is just an awful game in this regard, for use with minis. I'm not talking about the on-the-grid stuff ( although I think the handling time is way too involved and finicky in some of the more minis-oriented versions). I'm thinking more in the way characters are constantly changing locations ( sometimes radically- like the other side of the world), monsters and NPCs are constantly killed off ( making a need for a lot of variety to an extent that I couldn't keep up with, even with minis being a big money -sink hobby for me) making re-use annoying/impossible, and the vast range of character growth making early level threats pointless later on as the campaign progresses ( monsters starting to need to appear in large numbers to continue to be a threat, for example).<br/><br/>None of this is to say that fantasy, even pseudo Tolkien mixed with pseudo Howard is an impossible genre for minis use more generally. Just D&amp;D as generally played is bad for it.<br/><br/><br/>Now some more upfront constraints and direction ( vision) could fix that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460225/#Comment_460225" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-14T17:15:46+00:00" title="February 14, 2017  5:15PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It occurs to me that the generic literary technique for increasing the utility of individual toys is archetypal emblematization: if the characters and places featured in the game need to necessarily be <i>important</i>, everything <i>meaningful</i>, or the work put into propping them up is wasted, then there simply aren't that many possibilities. To wit:<br/><b>*</b> Either the scenario is intimate and tight, so we know that the game will be about <i>this</i> family;<br/><b>*</b> Or the fictional elements are inherently important to a wide variety of situations, so that we know that surely the King will be featured again and again;<br/><b>*</b> Or the fictional elements are archetypal in such a way as to enable reuse of props.<br/><br/>Considering that last option, imagine a game perhaps somewhat similar to <i>Amber</i>, except less American-adventurous and more symbolic-mythic. Every character in the game has their own personal Tarot card, and in fact there are only so many people in the world as there are Tarot cards. More distinctive people are Major Arcana, etc. - I'm sure this is familiar, a zillion games have done this sort of thing with Tarot.<br/><br/>So now we know in advance which miniatures we'll need: one for each Tarot card, no more and no less. That's going to be the cast of play, whatever the actual story. Furthermore, we understand that to a certain degree the miniatures are symbolic of the character more than representative; perhaps the character looks like their figure in concrete terms, or perhaps the miniature is merely symbolic of their inner nature. And of course, the eternal archetypes cannot be truly destroyed by the drama: even if you kill the Fool, perhaps somebody else will soon rise to fulfill the eternal role.<br/><br/>Perhaps it would be desirable to extend this approach to the terrain as well: what if the game was set in the Great Wheel cosmology of D&amp;D, like <i>Planescape</i>? Or something similar - the point is, what if the potential landscape of play was defined as an emblematic series of archetypal alternatives? You'd need only one "Abyss" play area (miniatures terrain or playmat or whatever), because whatever the actual fictional details, the only bit that <i>actually</i> matters in the environment is which plane of existence (or other emblematic location) the scene occurs in. You swap terrains when you swap planes (or cities, or countries, or whatever depending on the game), and otherwise play in one "location" in terms of props.<br/><br/>In more theoretical terms, this strategy of propping up a rpg would function by reducing the aesthetic ideas you wish to express with the miniatures into an essential emblematic set of meanings; whatever falls outside this essential reality is left to the spoken word, while the toys focus on capturing whatever it is that the game considers essential. This would, hopefully, make it possible to create a powerful set of toy-tools that could be used to play a variety of stories in an efficient way, getting a lot of punch out of every individual piece in the playset.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460226/#Comment_460226" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-14T17:33:22+00:00" title="February 14, 2017  5:33PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.<br/><br/>Yes, yes, yes, although my response was going to be a little more earthy.<br/><br/>An example of what I was thinking of ( and a bit of this was inspired by much earlier discussions of the Archipelago variant by Rafael Chandler "In a Grail Epoch" in other threads) would be something like this:<br/><br/>I've decided I want to do an Old West Game. I'm a miniatures junkie and willing to do some preliminary work.<br/><br/>I'll buy and paint up this set of Wild West Townsfolk miniatures :<br/><a href="http://www.oldglory25s.com/images/BMM512.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.oldglory25s.com/images/BMM512.jpg</a><br/><br/>And I'll buy something like this ( although maybe a 2D version for reasons discussed earlier) Old West Town printable/constructible file:<br/><a href="http://www.wargamevault.com/product/125288/Fatal-Frontier-Playset?manufacturers_id=4244" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wargamevault.com/product/125288/Fatal-Frontier-Playset?manufacturers_id=4244</a><br/><br/>(And maybe, I'll buy and do up some other minis, but let's just assume that).<br/><br/>The concept/vision is along the lines of old TV shows set in the old west. Gunsmoke is the classic one, since it was on TV forever, but maybe Deadwood if my players are feeling grittier.<br/><br/>Regardless, this is the core stuff of play. Going into it, that stuff is definitionally going to be at the center of things, although the exact bits that are important is hidden to me.<br/><br/>Any other players can suggest locations outside of town, other characters they want to see, other terrain bits, and so on, but to get them into the overall campaign, they have to be in on the making end of it.<br/><br/>And I'm thinking some sort of brainstorming session, where we go beyond just the toys and start making up the conflicts and personalities, and start thinking about the greater fiction stuff that will be involved, even before the GM(s) start incorporating that into adventures/sessions or players start choosing their preferred character(s) to play and develop.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460227/#Comment_460227" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-14T17:49:00+00:00" title="February 14, 2017  5:49PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find that set of western miniatures interesting because of the way it sets a sort of arbitrary limit to the fictional space. The manufacturer doesn't quite tell us why this set includes this particular cast of characters. Still, it looks like you are correct: that would probably be a sufficient set to take it as a starting point and creative constraint for a western drama.<br/><br/>It'd be interesting to get that social crafting thing going. My experience would make me expect that it'd be easier with something other than painted miniature figures, though. Something like paper miniatures would be more realistic: you'd need one or two drawing-capable players in the group, and the rest are pretty much on cutting and gluing (and baking and singing and other such support) duty. Making a single figure would take 10 minutes instead of however long it takes to buy and paint a real miniature, too.<br/><br/>Or, of course, set up the group from miniatures hobbyists from the first. If everybody's into painting miniatures, then it's not that unrealistic to suggest that participating in play involves a modicum of miniatures crafting, too.<br/><br/>My <i>Ars Magica</i> plans are sort of like this in that joining that game demands more than usual from the players, starting with actual competence with the rules set (far from trivial, it's a complex game) and going into various laborious character-building and grimoire-building exercises. I could see building a group like this as possible, provided the pitch for the game is really exciting and the GM can demonstrate its interest sufficiently to get the players to buy into it. Not as easy as your usual rpg, with extremely minimal entry requirements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460241/#Comment_460241" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-14T21:58:42+00:00" title="February 14, 2017  9:58PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always wanted to do something with LEGO.

They're usually semi-permanent, since you may need to transport them and re-assemble them.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of that concept myself, but that's even more involved than what I was originally thinking, at least as far as general RPG design is involved.<br/><br/>15' x 5' is biiiig. I stick with fold out 2.5' x 6' tables myself, since that's about the max size that fits in my apartment ( putting two together to make a 5' x 6' surface). I had been pondering possibilities like:<br/><br/>Using more tables, but in non-rectangles. Maybe L- or E-Shaped, or even some other, odd combo.<br/><br/>Separate tables of different sizes, to represent different "regions" or locations, and perhaps placed ( in the case of my apartment) in different rooms or at least separated by significant space.<br/><br/>Either approach might create some fascinating, odd effects.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460259/#Comment_460259" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-15T13:23:36+00:00" title="February 15, 2017  1:23PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I find that set of western miniatures interesting because of the way it sets a sort of arbitrary limit to the fictional space. The manufacturer doesn't quite tell us why this set includes this particular cast of characters. Still, it looks like you are correct: that would probably be a sufficient set to take it as a starting point and creative constraint for a western drama.</blockquote>\nThat particular manufacturer makes a couple of different "civilians" sets for different genres/periods and the market targeted are skirmish war gamers who play what I would call demi-rpgs or semi-rpgs. Those are games where occasionally having some unaligned, non-combatants are useful for various scenario reasons. So those sets are pretty much 20 stereotypical, genre/period appropriate people you'd expect to find in the setting who <b>aren't</b> likely to be a part of a gang/warband.<br/><br/>It's the fact that they aren't part of an obvious, armed, fighting faction that opens up the possibilities for role-play beyond fighting/combat encounters.\n<blockquote>Or, of course, set up the group from miniatures hobbyists from the first. If everybody's into painting miniatures, then it's not that unrealistic to suggest that participating in play involves a modicum of miniatures crafting, too.</blockquote>\nYes...and no.<br/><br/>Yes, because you're right, it would be vastly easier to get people already into miniatures hobby aspects to make the jump to contributing on that end.<br/><br/>No, in that they're also the most likely ones to view everything through the lens of a competitive side vs. side skirmish game.<br/><br/>[OTOH, players of non-RPG skirmish miniatures games usually also use vastly less complex and faster handling rules than something akin to D&amp;D 4e, so that at least is a bonus]<br/><br/>Thinking about it a bit more, while I personally like gaming miniatures, it would probably be easier to get Lego fans to do this kind of thing I'm talking about, especially if their love was more the Lego stuff, and not so much gaming. They'd be vastly less likely to be stuck in preconceived notions about how games were "supposed to work".<br/><br/>At one level, this comes down to a core conundrum I have when I talk about this stuff, whether the specifically encounter related stuff or the broader stuff involved in using minis at all as an enhancement or core part of a game style.<br/><br/>Essentially, I have these different groups of hobbyists I communicate with. Each group has talents and brain power I like to tap, related to their hobby, but cross-group ideas are hard to convey.<br/><br/>If I go to miniatures gamers with a question about where to find some kind of weird miniature or want suggestions on how to build or represent some physical thing in the setting, or how to do the same on a limited budget of time and/or money, I'm covered. In short order I'll have pretty much everything answered in exacting detail. They truly grok the joy of the miniatures as art and how it is important to play in a way that goes beyond the simple function of being positional markers.On the down side, if I ask about RPG-ish activities and how to work them into miniatures play, the best I usually get for answers is a poor, surface answer. For example, if I wanted to get some investigation and clue-finding ( including social mongering) into a game using miniatures, the answers tend to be along the lines of "Oh, just put a clue marker somewhere on the board or on a civilian miniature. If a player moves one of their miniatures into contact, they get the clue. When they get enough markers or the right combo of markers, they solve the mystery." Dull, seriously dull. Misses the point in a way that even the most basic type of RPGers wouldn't.<br/><br/>If I come here, I have a myriad of people open to all sorts of non-traditional RPG mechanics, who are really willing to explore questions of whether a mechanic is actually providing the desired play experience, and if not, what could be done instead that would do the trick. Usually the answers are very streamlined mechanics, as free of cruft as possible. And other great skills and know-how, too. Stuff about working within constraints, shared GM duties, all-participant input methods for creation of cast and setting. Scene framing and scene cutting, getting to the heart of what's at stake really in a resolution mechanic. I mean, really, just great stuff. Great stuff, provided that it's almost exclusively verbal/ theater of the mind-only.<br/><br/>What I need, for my manifesto-y take on this, is to be able to somehow take the positives that I find interacting with each group and smush them together, but get around the cultural blockages I find with each group.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460260/#Comment_460260" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-15T14:00:49+00:00" title="February 15, 2017  2:00PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2017 2:15PM by Hopeless_Wanderer.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>[...] Or the fictional elements are archetypal in such a way as to enable reuse of props.<br/><br/>Considering that last option, imagine a game perhaps somewhat similar to <i>Amber</i>, except less American-adventurous and more symbolic-mythic. Every character in the game has their own personal Tarot card, and in fact there are only so many people in the world as there are Tarot cards. More distinctive people are Major Arcana, etc. - I'm sure this is familiar, a zillion games have done this sort of thing with Tarot.<br/><br/>So now we know in advance which miniatures we'll need: one for each Tarot card, no more and no less. That's going to be the cast of play, whatever the actual story. Furthermore, we understand that to a certain degree the miniatures are symbolic of the character more than representative; perhaps the character looks like their figure in concrete terms, or perhaps the miniature is merely symbolic of their inner nature. And of course, the eternal archetypes cannot be truly destroyed by the drama: even if you kill the Fool, perhaps somebody else will soon rise to fulfill the eternal role.<br/><br/>Perhaps it would be desirable to extend this approach to the terrain as well: what if the game was set in the Great Wheel cosmology of D&amp;D, like <i>Planescape</i>? Or something similar - the point is, what if the potential landscape of play was defined as an emblematic series of archetypal alternatives? You'd need only one "Abyss" play area (miniatures terrain or playmat or whatever), because whatever the actual fictional details, the only bit that <i>actually</i> matters in the environment is which plane of existence (or other emblematic location) the scene occurs in. You swap terrains when you swap planes (or cities, or countries, or whatever depending on the game), and otherwise play in one "location" in terms of props.<br/><br/>In more theoretical terms, this strategy of propping up a rpg would function by reducing the aesthetic ideas you wish to express with the miniatures into an essential emblematic set of meanings; whatever falls outside this essential reality is left to the spoken word, while the toys focus on capturing whatever it is that the game considers essential. This would, hopefully, make it possible to create a powerful set of toy-tools that could be used to play a variety of stories in an efficient way, getting a lot of punch out of every individual piece in the playset.</blockquote>\nThis approach would work brilliantly for a heroquest in Glorantha, as an example.  I'm just making an observation about this; because as I was reading, that's what I was thinking.  It's partly synchronicity with reading <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prince of Sartar</span>.<br/><br/>It would also work well if your game was based on recreating faery tales/folk tales, Norse sagas, Arthurian legends, or anything tropey or archetypal.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460261/#Comment_460261" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-15T14:36:47+00:00" title="February 15, 2017  2:36PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2017 2:48PM by Hopeless_Wanderer.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Using Arthurian legend as an example, you'd need:<br/>1. As NPCs, a green knight, a red knight, a black knight, a damsel, a child (boy or girl), two or three peasants, an old man/woman, a cleric, an angel (or white knight) and some boss threat if it isn't already one of these first ones (like a wicked king/queen/witch/wizard/dragon).  Maybe throw in a wounded king/queen and a righteous king/queen.  But really you could get by with less than half of these because no story ever uses more than four of these;<br/>2. As terrain, a small chapel, a swamp, a stretch of road, an isolated well, a peasant's hut, a castle gate, a bedroom, a single great tree, a stream, and a woods (maybe four or five more trees).  If you're really extravagant add a throne room.  But really, again, you could get by with less than half of these.  You certainly wouldn't need them all to start.<br/><br/>If your game was about challenging stereotypes or re-inventing these legends, you could change things up a bit, but you still wouldn't need more miniatures and the terrain would be the same.

I can't believe I went quite so far afield before getting back to the bit of Eero's post you quoted just now, Hopeless_Wanderer.<br/><br/>I completely agree with the idea of cutting down to ( roughly) just the core essentials and having those be only relevant parts represented by the toys.<br/><br/>It's actually easier to describe what I'm thinking by way of an example with a link to product I'm actually considering buying if I ever run a fantasy geared game with minis, but a bit sandbox-y.<br/><br/>A printable, 50" x 50"<a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146895/Heroic-Maps--Giant-Maps-Agaricath-Drow-City" rel="nofollow">Drow City</a>.<br/><br/>Now, that's pretty big admittedly, but if you look at the link and think about even an adventure module using a dungeon where Drow are involved, it's really not that big of an area represented by the printed product. A module would have all kinds of other connected tunnels and mines and so on and take up even a vaster table area if all done up to use with minis at the same time.<br/><br/>In play, I would just use that if players were visiting a Drow city. It would be a stand-in for everything else involved, possibly for the entirety of that underground Drow Kingdom. It's the relevant bit where the important action/events will take place if you go visit the Drow.<br/><br/>I might, maybe, have some smaller tiles/maps printed up if I wanted to represent some locations along the way to the core city. Maybe.<br/><br/>Likewise, when I was showing off that Wild West Townsfolk set, those 20 miniatures wouldn't represent all of the people in even a very small old west town. They represent all of the (possibly) relevant characters. We can just assume there are dozens/hundreds/thousands of other people as part of the fiction, but we don't especially need a miniature for everyone else, any more than we need every tree for a forest. Show ( and collect) the essential bits, the rest is assumed.<br/><br/>{Apparently model railroaders have a similar concept. They call it "selective compression", where you show a small-ish area that represents visually and mentally much more. For example, a warehouse and a single factory on a big model rr layout represents an entire industrial area of a city)<br/><br/>The link FFilz was showing with the Lego layout does something similar, but on a single large table, rather than as a series of printed and mounted maps. If you look at that thing, the lay out is pretty clearly representing much more fictional space than the area covered by the toys, if we scale it to the Lego people.<br/><br/>And toys do that regularly. Since I've been talking about how "toy play" ought to ( in my manifesto-y way) be a better basis for miniatures use in RPGs/SGs, here's the toy I desperately wanted as a child, but never found under the X-Mas tree ( <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> ) : <a href="http://www.starwars.com/news/the-vintage-vault-thats-no-moon-its-a-playset" rel="nofollow">1970s Death Star Playset</a>.<br/><br/>Man, look at all the selective compression going on there! They've reduced a moon sized battle station to a few stylized areas. The only thing really missing is the docking bay. As kids ( with my buddy's playset...grrr!), we'd just put his Millennium Falcon Toy next to that. Done. There's our escape to the docking bay bit taken care of!<br/><br/>Even with all that selective compression going on, we had hours upon hours of toy play with that thing. The same concept or approach can be ported across to gaming with the use of miniatures, if we bring stuff down to the essentials, whether of locations ( like that playset or the Drow City printout) or the collection of character miniatures ( including NPCs/monsters).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460264/#Comment_460264" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-15T14:56:10+00:00" title="February 15, 2017  2:56PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2017 2:57PM by Hopeless_Wanderer.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It works, because in these types of tales, only the hero, villain, and maybe one other person (side-kick, rescuee, or mentor/donor) have names.

As NPCs, a green knight, a red knight, a black knight, a damsel, a child (boy or girl), two or three peasants, an old man/woman, a cleric, an angel (or white knight) and some boss threat if it isn't already one of these first ones (like a wicked king/queen/witch/wizard/dragon).  Maybe throw in a wounded king/queen and a righteous king/queen.  But really you could get by with less than half of these because no story ever uses more than four of these;<br/>2. As terrain, a small chapel, a swamp, a stretch of road, an isolated well, a peasant's hut, a castle gate, a bedroom, a single great tree, a stream, and a woods (maybe four or five more trees).  If you're really extravagant add a throne room.  But really, again, you could get by with less than half of these.  You certainly wouldn't need them all to start.<br/><br/>If your game was about challenging stereotypes or re-inventing these legends, you could change things up a bit, but you still wouldn't need more miniatures and the terrain would be the same.  With faery tales, it might even be easier and require less.</blockquote>\nThat's a pretty great example.<br/><br/>Going with what you've suggested in your post, I would probably look at that as the list for the game master/initiating player to collect. There's the base unifying vision, expressed through a core toy collection.<br/><br/>Building off your concept, and assuming the other players ( or a majority of them) also wanted to use minis and would contribute something ( the willingness and budgets are there, but let's also try to make it as easy as possible on those), what would/should other participants bring to the collection?<br/><br/>My initial thought for a list would look something like:<br/>Their Knight<br/>Their Squire or other helper character ( or pet or horse)<br/><br/>A certain minimum ( 1? 2? 5?) number off the following list:<br/>A potential rival<br/>A miniature that fits with one of the settings/terrain bits ( a monk or nun for the chapel)<br/>An animal ( or animal family) or monster ( a wolf pack, a bear, a stag, a family of badgers)<br/>A small group of potential hostiles ( Picts, bandits, angry peasants, or raiders of some flavor, like 2-5 of them)<br/>Some other character type you'd expect to find in the setting, but not already covered ( a foreign knight, a travelling trader, a beggar)<br/>A terrain piece that expands one of the core terrain pieces or ties to it ( maybe a small prison cell to pair with the throne or castle gate. Someone is always imprisoned, right?)<br/>An entirely new small terrain piece that fits the setting ( a mysterious cave, a small lake with an island, a boat or ship, tents and stands for a jousting tournament)<br/>Some general area terrain, or terrains bits ( a banquet table, some more trees, a small hill or two, a couple of candle stands, a religious statue)<br/><br/>If you had 3 other players, with those minimums, you'd still have a bunch of stuff to work with when you were done, but paired with a "vision" of where play would go broadly. It would also be easy to expand very slowly and without vast expenditures of time or money.<br/><br/>And that expansion concept could also play into the "unlocking" concept that was being talked about earlier.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460271/#Comment_460271" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-15T18:07:44+00:00" title="February 15, 2017  6:07PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Sigh. I can't believe I went quite so far afield before getting back to the bit of Eero's post you quoted just now, Hopeless_Wanderer.<br/><br/>I completely agree with the idea of cutting down to ( roughly) just the core essentials and having those be only relevant parts represented by the toys.<br/><br/>It's actually easier to describe what I'm thinking by way of an example with a link to product I'm actually considering buying if I ever run a fantasy geared game with minis, but a bit sandbox-y.<br/><br/>A printable, 50" x 50"<a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146895/Heroic-Maps--Giant-Maps-Agaricath-Drow-City" rel="nofollow">Drow City</a>.<br/><br/>Now, that's pretty big admittedly, but if you look at the link and think about even an adventure module using a dungeon where Drow are involved, it's really not that big of an area represented by the printed product. A module would have all kinds of other connected tunnels and mines and so on and take up even a vaster table area if all done up to use with minis at the same time.<br/><br/>In play, I would just use that if players were visiting a Drow city. It would be a stand-in for everything else involved, possibly for the entirety of that underground Drow Kingdom. It's the relevant bit where the important action/events will take place if you go visit the Drow.<br/></blockquote>\nYea, you could get a lot of mileage with a map like that. It has enough different locations to satisfy the needs of lots of play. Some of the locations could even change purpose from "game" to "game", some building serving as what ever type of shop or home is necessary for the current "scenario".\n<blockquote><br/>I might, maybe, have some smaller tiles/maps printed up if I wanted to represent some locations along the way to the core city. Maybe.<br/></blockquote>\nModule D1 Descent into the Depths had a node and path map with several set pieces along this idea.\n<blockquote><br/>The link FFilz was showing with the Lego layout does something similar, but on a single large table, rather than as a series of printed and mounted maps. If you look at that thing, the lay out is pretty clearly representing much more fictional space than the area covered by the toys, if we scale it to the Lego people.<br/></blockquote>\nYes, very definitely selective compression, yet obviously it works. I have yet to do any sort of gaming with that setup, but here's a setup of Evil Stevie's Pirate Game:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=2334190" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=2334190</a><br/><br/>The islands in the same size range as the ships, and the space between islands is often less than the length of a ship, yet hours of play can be had.<br/><br/>The Pirate Game generated a lot of talk between Chris Weeks and I about this sort of game. The challenge was finding the right balance between mechanics and toy play.<br/><br/>Some things about LEGO present some interesting possibilities:<br/><br/>- Ease of customization of characters<br/><br/>- Ability to change what the character is holding<br/><br/>- Ability to change the scenery (battle damage, new construction)<br/><br/>Note that my castle setup is actually made following a modular standard, so it can be rearranged to some extent. With more pieces and a larger space, there would be even more options for rearrangement.\n<blockquote><br/>And toys do that regularly. Since I've been talking about how "toy play" ought to ( in my manifesto-y way) be a better basis for miniatures use in RPGs/SGs, here's the toy I desperately wanted as a child, but never found under the X-Mas tree ( <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> ) : <a href="http://www.starwars.com/news/the-vintage-vault-thats-no-moon-its-a-playset" rel="nofollow">1970s Death Star Playset</a>.<br/><br/>Man, look at all the selective compression going on there! They've reduced a moon sized battle station to a few stylized areas. The only thing really missing is the docking bay. As kids ( with my buddy's playset...grrr!), we'd just put his Millennium Falcon Toy next to that. Done. There's our escape to the docking bay bit taken care of!<br/><br/>Even with all that selective compression going on, we had hours upon hours of toy play with that thing. The same concept or approach can be ported across to gaming with the use of miniatures, if we bring stuff down to the essentials, whether of locations ( like that playset or the Drow City printout) or the collection of character miniatures ( including NPCs/monsters).</blockquote>\nCool playset, and yea, that type of toy presents immense possibilities.<br/><br/>Frank<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460304/#Comment_460304" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-16T12:28:55+00:00" title="February 16, 2017 12:28PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2017 12:42PM by Hopeless_Wanderer.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bob, you beat me to the punch mentioning <i>selective compression</i>.  I also had an epiphany looking at a LEGO set box (not the same set as you, but the effect was similar).  But, actually, you got me thinking about selective compression even before that, when you gave the example, in an earlier thread, of placing a threat on the edge of the table but outside the "play space" to represent an approaching threat.  Then moving it closer and closer as the game progresses to represent their imminent arrival and increase the dramatic tension.  That's what really got me thinking this way.  Before that I was really struggling to warp a skirmish game into a story game. <br/><br/>Eero's brilliant comment about selective archetypal compression really gets us back on track, I think.<br/><br/>There's other ways that selective compression can be used.  In stories (and RPGs), time and space are always selectively compressed.  When the hero goes on a quest, we don't hear about every gruelling mile travelled; we don't see every step taken.  Time and space are compressed.  That's the most obvious kind of selective compression, but another one would be <i>scale</i>.<br/><br/>You're a miniatures wargamer (I was too, long ago).  We both know that minis come in 6mm, 10mm, 15mm, 25mm, 30mm, and 54mm.  Why does the game have to stick to just one scale?  Why can't we use scale to our advantage?  <br/><br/>Think of it from the movie making perspective.  A film isn't usually just make of close-up, or just long-shots, but with a mixture of close, medium, and long shots edited together.  The viewer's perspective in relationship to the action is always changing.  It was, again, LEGO that got me thinking about the creative use of scale in mini+ play, so I will give an example from that (but the same example would work with other types of minis).<br/><br/>In LEGO, there are three main scales (there are others, but they're not as relevant for our discussion and not as well-known).  From smallest to largest, they are: micro-scale, heroica scale, and minifigure scale.  You might be most familiar with minifigure scale, but you can search online and easily find examples of the other scales.  Why not use these different scales within the same game? This can work as both a selective visual compression and as a selective compression of the game mechanics themselves.  Think of these ways scale can be used effectively:<br/><br/>*if the GM wants to show the presence of something at a great distance, or great distances travelled, or a tactical-sized battle space, use microscale for that.<br/>*if the action is wide ranging over a large action space then use heroica scale,<br/>*if the action is close up, or critical for the game play use minifigure scale,<br/><br/>There are more examples of ways scale can be used within the same game, but I think you get the point.<br/><br/>When you chain these together, you're dynamically creating a visual and mechanical kind of selective compression.  <br/><br/>One final example to illustrate what I'm talking about, imagine our questing hero is approaching a castle in the distance for her battle with the final boss.  You throw down the hero on a section of road in minifigure scale with a micro-scale  castle at the edge of the place space.  Maybe she meets a peasant on the road with a secret about the castle.  As play progresses and she approaches the castle, you put down the castle gate in minifigure scale for some important trial she has to pass before entering--passing the guards, answering a riddle, tricking them, whatever).  Then, when your hero is exploring the castle space, you switch to heroica scale.  When something key is going to happen in the castle, you switch back to minifigure scale.<br/><br/>I think this is both a money and play space saving approach to mini+ play (and taken with the other contributors suggestions above solves your "sandbox problem").  I think it also has some interesting effects on the actual game play itself, which I'd be happy to discuss.  <br/><br/>I've run out of time to write, so I'll leave it to you to decide whether to continue with this idea or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460305/#Comment_460305" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-16T12:30:17+00:00" title="February 16, 2017 12:30PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It works, because in these types of tales, only the hero, villain, and maybe one other person (side-kick, rescuee, or mentor/donor) have names.

As a kind of similar concept, I can talk about a couple of things I've considered, but with more gaming minis.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Backdrop "flats" for urban settings.</span><br/><br/>You know how in Old West movies, the street scenes are usually just the facades of the buildings painted up ( Blazing Saddles makes a big visual joke about this)?  I thought about doing this for some urban environment gaming. If a building interior isn't important, just make a series of facades with a base that will hold them upright, maybe 12" or so long. Then pair them with buildings that <b>are</b>relevant with accessible interiors. The stuff isn't really in scale to one another, but if you were doing a big table layout, it gives an effect of a much bigger space by blocking line of sight and still having relevant areas relevant.  <br/><br/>For example, I might use this <a href="http://www.wargamevault.com/product/101593/Modular-Urban-Center-Kit-MUCK?manufacturers_id=4244" rel="nofollow">Modular Urban Center Kit</a>, but only print and mount the fronts of the buildings. I could then pair it with some of these <a href="http://thevirtualarmchairgeneral.com/620-Mean-Sets.htm" rel="nofollow">larger scaled interior sets</a>.<br/><br/>Not quite the same idea as the mixed Lego scale, but getting there.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using littler dudes for bigger battles</span><br/>While I mostly tend to think of RPGs with minis being RPG scale conflicts ( a few dudes vs a few dudes, and maybe recycling mooks), sometimes you have a big battle event. If you don't also have appropriate amounts of genre soldiery handy, it might be more reasonable on a budget ( and we all have practical limits on money and time budgets, even miniatures fanatics) to use 1/72 plastics for the mooks and allies and just pair them with the larger 25-28-30mm gaming miniatures.<a href="http://www.plasticsoldierreview.com/Periods.aspx" rel="nofollow">Plastic Solider Review</a> has gobs of pictures by historical period of what is out there, but there are also a couple of manufacturers making D&amp;D and LotR style fantasy minis in those scales.<br/><br/>ha might be one of the cases where I wouldn't worry too much about painting up the minis pretty, and just go with spray single colors for the sides if  was in a hurry. I also wouldn't worry too much about the visual difference in scales, as the heroes/villains are more important anyway, and a movie would visually make them stand out from the crowd, so why not do something similar by use of scale.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If you've got a big scale switch for some aspect of play, it's completely okay to switch over to littler toys</span><br/>SF games are the ones I'm thinking of here, where you might suddenly have a space ship fight or chase. Yeah, completely switch over to tiny spaceships and even have planets represented by a colored disc of smallish size, even though space is vast. A bit more like extreme selective compression. It wouldn't be hard to vary scale with this stuff either or use the "building threat concept" to give a feel of vast, sweeping areas. A Mad Max type setting or even a Dust Bowl Bank Robber car chase through the countryside could work similarly, with matchbox cars or even smaller toys involved for those scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460308/#Comment_460308" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-16T13:20:18+00:00" title="February 16, 2017  1:20PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Well, what I meant was that in most of these kinds of stories, the hero meets people during her quest (usually three) who are just referred to as a monk, or peasant, or child, etc.  These characters have something the hero needs before the end of the story, but they aren't important enough to have names.

Yeah, definitely. I usually think in terms of mooks/victims/townsfolk, but Stock Characters is probably a nicer name for them!<br/><br/>That Old West set I linked upthread is pretty much nothing but Old West genre stock characters you'd find in a town. Bartender, merchant, card sharp, saloon girl, school marm, dusty old miner, town drunk, blacksmith, etc.<br/><br/>If you were playing repeatedly in a single setting ( all our stories revolve around Tombstone), I'd expect them to start getting names and personalities, but if the main characters head to another town for an adventure, I'd certainly re-use the bartender for whatever bartender was n the saloon in the other town. Heck, I might re-use the bar as well.<br/><br/><br/>Taking your concept, in a design I might really put that as one of the core things a planning player needs to do when they're starting their unifying vision for overall play.<br/><br/>They need to collect X number of Stock character minis and also Y number of stock (selectively compressed) relevant/essential locations.<br/><br/>It's then up to the other players to, in some fashion, modify the stock chassis by their contributions.<br/><br/><br/>Oh man, good stuff is coming out of this thread.

Likewise, it's fundamental that participant contributions beyond the initiating player ( in some fashion) are going to be involved.<br/><br/>This is going to impact recruitment of players. To get the most out of this type of play, you need to have folks down with the concept or willing to be down with the concept over time.<br/><br/>The planning/initiating player needs to have some kind of vision of core play and plan out the core toys involved. This is their responsibility. This includes core stock character toys and core stock locations. How they gather or create these things is up to them.<br/><br/>The concept of <i>essentials</i> and <i>selective compression </i>, on both core locations and core/stock characters, guides them in this. The goal is to keep this to a relatively small number of each.<br/><br/>This all needs to be presented to the group as a whole at some preliminary stage.<br/><br/>Other participants are going to be expected to contribute, optimally both to the toy collection ( and related hobby aspects like painting and assembly) and the fiction direction/initial situation set up.<br/><br/>The additions of the other participants modifies the core concept, core fiction, and may initially "unlock" plot potential, adventure hooks, or potential rewards.<br/><br/>It's probably a good idea to have backup methods to account for varying levels of participants' skill, budget, and commitment constraints. Perhaps "trade-offs" of supporting activities if someone has wildly different talents/skills/budget than the bulk of the group's participants?<br/><br/>If a very large collection of location and character toys are already available, it may be possible to use a kind of subtractive process, where the initiating player still chooses stuff for the "core vison", but has other participants choose and prioritize elements from the even greater collection or , alternately, to block out some of the collection as undesirable for the (initial) set up. Think of this in comparison to a Fiasco Playset: You never use every element of a playset, but everything on those lists is paired with the "vision" or core concept of the playset in question.<br/><br/>The core set + participant contributions define the beginning of play, but any of those things can later be expanded upon by further contributions over time, assuming longer term ( multi session) play is involved. Methods and suggestions for this are appreciated, as it likely unlocks other fiction or potential rewards and challenges.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460311/#Comment_460311" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-16T14:56:23+00:00" title="February 16, 2017  2:56PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The "board" in play</b><br/><br/>There are two main possibilities, and play could switch between both, session to session. Only one should be used in any given session, as a way of minimizing handling time.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Big Board ( the modified war gamer approach, very similar to what FFilz was showing in his Lego board game link) Approach</span><br/><br/>For the session, a large table is laid out. Every possible location where action will take place is already on the table, and there may be discrete "locations" where scale is different form other locations on the table, or where scales are mixed, along the lines of what Hopeless-Wanderer was talking about. The locations are those essential/selectively compressed locations. They (probably) are in rough layout to one another as they exist in the greater fiction, although intervening distances are deleted or also selectively compressed in some fashion to show location "boundaries". Possibly those boundary zones are also "generic" location types.<br/><br/>In any case, what you see on the table is where you can have scenes taking place, with minor exceptions for easily done, all-verbal, mini scenes, although even those are probably done as bets able with the toys, as that is a core part of play.<br/><br/>In any case, few modifications to the location toys will likely occur during play, and it's not expected that any locations will be added. What you see is what you have to work with.<br/><br/>This style is best for<br/>A special session or convention<br/>When you have some available space where games normally occur for it to be left up ( god help you if you have cats) or can easily be stored and brought out for sessions in that consistently available space.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The RPG table standard approach</span><br/>You're consistently playing at a table, and you have a good idea of how much space is commonly available in the center of the table (or how much you can make regularly).<br/><br/>This circumstance is the one where having printed or drawn key essential, selectively compressed locations ready to go works best. These can be enhanced by the addition of a small amount of 3D or 2D spot terrain. In any case, each key, essential location needs to be sized to fit within that available table space, regardless of the fictional scale it represents.<br/><br/>This very likely works best when each key location is largely ready to go as a single mounted play surface, spot terrain modifications are kept to a minimum, and few character toys are being used at any given time for a scene.<br/><br/>Storage and travel considerations can be minimized by using both sides of a foamcore or cardboard sheet for different key locations.<br/><br/>In any case, whatever location is currently on the table is where things are happening. switching to another location is going to mean at least minor reset time eating up play time, so figure out the best ways to get the most out of each location each tie it's used.<br/>Truly minor side scenes can be done completely verbally to save on breakdown and reset times.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460315/#Comment_460315" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-16T15:23:11+00:00" title="February 16, 2017  3:23PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re-use of character toys:<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stock characters</span><br/>Stock characters can be re-used easily...because they're stock characters. If you have to initially skip on decoration, these are lower priority than main characters, so painting can wait, or you can look for useable pre-paints for these guys.  These are supporting role characters, until it's necessary by way of fiction ( or player choice) for them to become important. If they become important(ish), but are later "killed" in fiction, it's easy for the toy to be recycled back to "stock character" status.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Important characters, whether PC or NPC (or just focus characters if you're going more GM-less/GM-full)</span><br/><br/>The design of the game needs to account for this and have methods handy for why these characters aren't killed-killed on a regular basis.<br/><br/>It can be mechanical or fictional or both. You'll still want to work in concepts of failure or loss in combat or horrible accidents, but it needs to be in a way that still allows re-use for these character toys, at least up until some point in play where the group agrees that indeed Death is On The Line!<br/><br/>In D&amp;D-ish games, this may be helped by a flatter range of power levels, and player characters being less Zero  on the Zero to Hero spectrum than normal. If levels/HD 1-10 is your range ( how old school am I?), start PCs at 3-4 level, and reserve lower levels for companions, with their levels related to importance more than anything else. Heck, you could even start PCs more at 5-6 level of ability, companions at 2-4, hirelings at 1st, and give everyone 0 XP. They don't advance until they exceed whatever the XP minimums would have been for their level. This should give you long play, keep mooks in groups threatening, and let them be able to deal with some monsters without constantly either being eaten or constantly overwhelming the monsters.<br/><br/>For baddies, maybe part of your prep is ...you always need to note the baddies' top three preferred methods of escaping death at the hands of adventurers, and assume the baddy in question has already prepped for one or more of those. If they get away with it, they'll reprioritize those methods next time, which should keep players on their toes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460317/#Comment_460317" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-16T16:57:58+00:00" title="February 16, 2017  4:57PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Action at whatever location is currently in play</b><br/><br/>Okay, so this is what I was focusing on initially, so I'd best get back to it.<br/><br/>In Big Table Play, you'll define what part of the board the action is currently taking place in. Indicate it in some fashion, whether physically or by gesture ( this area I just showed you by pointing out the boundaries with my finger) In RPG Standard Table situation, it's whatever tiles/map just got placed.<br/><br/>Initial placement of the toys is defined by the fictional circumstances described.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Freeplay</span> occurs for initial movement. Describe and show it with the toys. Use Dungeon World type methods if initiative matters because of conflicts of ideas or someone is just plain describing stuff that doesn't really fit with group consensus, and go on. Keep doing it until some kind of action-packed occurrence comes up. It might never come up if it's mostly verbal exchanges, no matter how tense. that's okay. It's how kids play with toys all the time.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But wait! Now action/combat is going on!</span><br/>Okay, because I'm being manifesto-y, this is more a list of general concepts that could be used in some combination and would need a bit more formalization. All of them though are about ease of handling time, and are an inspired muddle from the 13th Age/Range band stuff Adam linked, Fate, Dungeon World, and a couple of minis skirmish games I've owned and played.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The defined location is the area where everything important happens, but you can use space outside of the area to show looming problems/foreshadowing<br/></span><br/>This is what Hopeless_Wanderer was referring to. You've got your "arena", but you can still use the area around it as a set up ( think of it as a soft move in DW showing future dangers) for enemies that might soon enter the "arena". Keep them back a little bit from the edge, and note them verbally by way of fiction. Place them relative to where they'll enter the arena on the equivalent of a hard move result in DW. Since the fiction is partly defined by your map or toy layout, make this make some kind of sense. Unless they're physically touching the boundary line of the arena, they're still at a distance. If they touch the boundary line, they're almost there and if fictional reasons allow, they can interact with the arena and miniatures there ( usually it means they have ranged weapons or rapid movement capability).<br/><br/>"I hear sirens. The cops are on their way!" ( Moves little cop car up, but not touching boundary line for arena, at some place where a road is shown in the arena. Vroom-vroom)<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Move distance is relative to size of the play surface/location being used. Just name a fraction of the longest distance as a standard move and derive everything from that.<br/></span><br/>This works best for ungridded play maps or 3D terrain lay outs. It works better also if you just have relatively similar sized "arenas" you use or just consistently use the same fraction.<br/><br/>"It takes 3 ( or 4 or 5) moves to cross the arena on good going at normal combat walking pace for a healthy human being of normal capabilities".<br/><br/>It might take more moves if you're in super slo-mo, if terrain features are limiting movement, or some character is sneaking or crawling, or has faster movement abilities. You get the idea though, just adjust as needed on the fly or until you've developed methods agreeable to your group.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Option: Area movement</span><br/>This works similar to Fate. Define areas. People normally move one area at a time. Areas aren't necessarily consistent in size. Often they're defined by a significant feature. With miniatures, what fits in a an area is what fits in an area, and movement is possible within an area. this also a bit like 13th Age where characters in melee are always within one move of a pal. Can be modified based on other factors, as above.<br/><br/>Works best with 2D drawn or printed surfaces. If you're keeping to essentials/selective compression and just important areas, you could have all of this done even before play ever starts. A bit harder, but not impossible with 3D terrain or Lego.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Option: straight line movement only ( limited or unlimited distance within the arena, I've seen both), with terrain interactions.</span><br/><br/>With this kind of movement of toys, they can pivot before and after their movement, but not during movement ( the pivot may or may not be a move in itself. Kinda depends on what you're playing with).<br/><br/>The character may not interact with more than one piece of terrain during it's move ( there are some variations available on this as well). <br/><br/>For example, a character could move in a straight line and hop a fence and keep moving, but it couldn't hop a second fence in the same move. Likewise, it couldn't switch directions of movement during the move to get around the second fence, although it could end it's move faced in such a way that on a following move it could work it's way around the end of the fence.<br/><br/>This works best with an arena that has lots of terrain messing up movement and line of sight, and where areas that might represent say a forest are broken up into smaller clumps of trees and rocks, rather than one big area representing it.<br/><br/>Likewise, rules variants can be added where some terrain is "sticky" and the miniatures can not move away from it on the turn it interacted with it and must still be in contact.<br/><br/>Example: Crawling through a window. My little dude makes a straight move through the window, but it's a sticky terrain feature. My guy goes through it, but his move ends with him just on the other side of it, with his base touching the house he entered at the window.<br/><br/>And, naturally, some terrain may not be entered by certain characters or dangerous to them. You know how that works.<br/><br/>What this does: It increases the effective size of even a small arena, as characters need to navigate around problem areas ( or enemy characters) while skipping fiddly terrain multipliers.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ranged attacks and reactivity</span><br/>Once you've got your methods for movement, the other stuff starts to fall into place.<br/><br/>Ranged attacks depend a little on genre and how you're working movement. With area movement, really short effective ranges (pistols thrown weapons) are only good within an area or possibly into an adjacent area if a miniature is clearly placed touching the area boundary, and only then against miniatures in that area very close to the boundary (like a base distance or so away). Most other weapons are one or two areas in distance ( you still need clean, open lines of sight). really long distance weapons may even fire to or from that arena boundary to interact with looming threats, but they'd be an exceptional item in some way.<br/><br/>Really short ranged weapons are probably also Reactive, meaning they can Intercept, much like intercept movement in 13th Age. I'd likely do that with any form of movement.<br/><br/>With one of the more open forms of movement, you main limiters are terrain and line of sight. I'd parallel movement restrictions and terrain effects, using a similar methods as for restrictions on movement. The simple one is that visually blocking terrain blocks line of fire unless the target is directly in contact with the intervening terrain ( or some weapon quality is in effect, or other rules simply give a modifier to a roll).<br/><br/>I'd also assume that the range of weapons was anywhere within the boundaries of the arena, unless there was some special case involved. The Star Wars collectible miniatures game worked like this for all your baseline shooty wepaons, and just made spate rules for the effects of very long range or very short range weapons.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460319/#Comment_460319" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-16T17:22:05+00:00" title="February 16, 2017  5:22PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry for the wall of text.

Some big, some little, all adjacent to one another ( no blanks spaces). Sometimes one polygon fit weirdly with another adjacent polygon.<br/><br/>Anyway, the guy used it for all of his games, placing terrain on top of it, and used area movement. The size of the polygon directly related the number of miniatures that could fit into it ( if they couldn't all fit, they couldn't all fit). Sometimes he'd line up house doors and windows so that they sat astride one polygon while others were reached from different polygons.<br/><br/>It made for an interesting approach that also factored in some terrain effects without actually doing more common terrain effects ( like doubling or tripling costs of movement through an area) and made for interesting tactical choices.<br/><br/>Might also be a neat tool to consider using.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460386/#Comment_460386" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-17T14:29:08+00:00" title="February 17, 2017  2:29PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a side question for the folks who've experimented with some of this kind of thing, in whatever form:<br/><br/>Do you find that players interpret the use of miniatures and maps/terrain to mean "<b>Only </b>action/combat"?<br/><br/>I've had mixed results with experiments I've done.<br/><br/>Some people seem to naturally gravitate towards my preferred result of  about a 40/60 proportion Talky:Action, while other seem to be 5/95 Talky:Action ( which I tend not to be going for.

Usually they're slightly smaller than 24" x24".<br/><br/>Is it a common experience for anyone else that they use these kinds of techniques?<br/><br/>If it is, it may point to more mechanical approaches that can be experimented with design-wise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460429/#Comment_460429" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-19T13:44:02+00:00" title="February 19, 2017  1:44PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hope you all are continuing to follow along and will continue to bring in your great ideas.<br/><br/>I did have one of those moments of clarity as I was waking up this morning.<br/><br/>In pretty much all of these [minis+] threads, talking about some of these less-game-y, more imaginative play type approaches, there's inevitably a point where a couple Lego fans come in and really seem to grok where I'm going with it.<br/><br/>And it's always a bit weird for me personally, because I really don't have that childhood connection to Lego, but I appreciate the contributions.<br/><br/>This morning, I had one of those A-Ha! moments where I realized, well of course the gamers who are Lego-heads get it more than just about any other type of gamer!<br/><br/>Later on today or tomorrow, I'll try to post why I think that is, and see if Lego-heads who are gamers agree with some of those, new-to-me, insights.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460449/#Comment_460449" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-20T14:49:07+00:00" title="February 20, 2017  2:49PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2017 2:57PM by komradebob.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>My <i>A-Ha!</i>moment regarding Lego and these minis+ threads and ideas about combining toys with story-gaming-ish approaches to imaginative play</b><br/><br/>I'm beginning to think, at this point, that if I end up designing a game, or even just a "manifesto" with some game mechanics in it ( <i>Stealing Cthulhu</i> is an inspiration for the approach), maybe  should switch gears entirely away from gaming miniatures and over to Lego ( and similar, compatible, building brick toys).<br/><br/>Part of it is, that while I've gotten great ideas and feedback from all sorts of gamers, I have noticed that Lego fans (who, in addition, are also gamers) seemed to grok where I was going with a lot of these concepts rather rapidly. And they seemed to grok it in a way that other gamers, even gamers who like and use miniatures, had a harder time grasping.<br/><br/>(I have a few of those folks in my IRL circles of friends, so it also may make properly testing these concepts easier)<br/><br/>I realized it came down in equal parts to qualities of Lego fans, but also qualities of the toys themselves.<br/><br/>Often, when Lego fans talked about the potential for using Lego for this sort of play, the focus would come down to qualities of the toys themselves which offered advantages over gaming miniatures. And there are certainly some of those, although I personally will always love gaming miniatures first and foremost. Roughly, these are the Lego advantages I see:<br/><br/>1) They're sturdy in a way that gaming miniatures are not. yes, some constructed item may be knocked apart during handling, but it's relatively easy to fix it by snapping things back together.<br/><br/>2) They come in colors and the individual bricks can be recombined multiple ways, so re-use is high.<br/><br/>3) Generally, they're readily available in a way gaming minis aren't. You find them locally, but also it's easy to source them from online sellers without the need to constantly deal with multiple online sellers for specific parts. Even if you want to do something really specific, you probably don't need to deal with a half dozen different sellers.<br/><br/>4) Almost anything you want to represent can be created in some fashion, provided you have enough bricks available.<br/><br/>5) They often have pre-made kits that you can buy that have very easy use in different genres that line up well with common gaming genres.<br/><br/>6) The skills necessary to build something with Lego ( for beginners) are just much less intimidating than for those associated with gaming miniatures and terrain. While there is a high skill involved that experienced Lego heads bring to building stuff with Lego, even a beginner can probably, given a pile of Lego brick build a house, if a not terribly intricate or involved one, and in fairly rapid order.<br/><br/>So those are the inherent qualities of the bricks, among others I've undoubtedly forgotten.<br/><br/>It was more the "qualities" of Lego-heads and the use of Lego that sold me more on the concept, however. Some of those I see:<br/><br/>1) They aren't afraid to spend money, and they very likely already have spent money of significant amounts if they're long-term Lego-heads. Although often not spoken of directly, there's always something of a cash concern for posters when I talk about minis use. And I get it. Gaming minis collections don't sprout over night, and to try to build one over night can be rather daunting compared to your bank account and discretionary spending limits. Lego heads, like minis gamers, have committed to a long term hobby and have generally built up a fairly large collection with a rather high dollar value over time, if the MSRP of all of that stuff was suddenly tallied up.<br/><br/>2) They're used to building stuff. Maybe not the same techniques as painting gaming minis and building that sort of terrain, but Lego fans get that building is part of the fun. Often Lonely Fun, but you have something cool to share ( if even just visually) when it's finished.<br/><br/>3) Lego are toys. There's no question about this, no matter how cool and intricate the thing is you end up constructing. They're not inherently associated with gaming, in themselves, but they are associated with play. And that association is more important for the kinds of things I've been talking about than the game parts.<br/><br/>4) Depending on the things you're buying and building with Lego, there's often implied beginnings of story/situation/characters. Lego fans often make dioramas of sorts. It isn't just a castle, it's a castle with stuff going on and characters there, even if it's setting on a shelf on display.<br/><br/>5) As with many toys and toy play, Lego fans seem to inherently grok selective compression and "essential" locations, and even how to fit it all in one big display. There's not as much need to explain that, because they're already doing it.<br/><br/>6) They just plain get "toy-joy". With Lego, there's no concealing that you're an adult playing with toys, in the way, sometimes, you see with minis gamers. They get the tactile and visual fun of this stuff, but not concealed behind talk of artiness or historical accuracy or other nonsense social camouflage.<br/><br/><br/>So anyway, this all makes me think that, in the future, if I pursue this line of thinking and design, I may just start to focus on gamers who are also Lego fans, and just plain hope that other folks encountering it will make the mental translation to other formats ( like gaming miniatures and terrain) on their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460452/#Comment_460452" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-20T15:23:59+00:00" title="February 20, 2017  3:23PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, to me the material technique of using Legos seems eminently sensible, despite my not being a Lego hobbyist myself. Legos have two key qualities that make them superior gaming toys compared to miniatures in my eyes:<br/><b>*</b> A consistent, non-realistic, symbolic visual language that nevertheless has rich ways to express complex concepts.<br/><b>*</b> High reusability.<br/><br/>As a practical consideration, I think that Vincent's Lego mecha combat game is a feasible and entertaining-looking little wargame, just the sort that I might play if I had the time for minis wargames like that. The Lego element contributes to this assessment; I probably would not be as interested if the game was presented as a line of robot models you purchase one by one; that just veers too much away from creative art and towards consumer behavior for me.<br/><br/>Odds are that if I ever get seriously into playing with toys, it's going to be either origami or Legos <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460454/#Comment_460454" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-20T16:36:42+00:00" title="February 20, 2017  4:36PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2017 4:37PM by Stephen P.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All of those make sense to me, as an avid gamer and also Lego fan!

For example, the model railroaders that I know grok many of your points, but there's something about modeling that often brings out a serious, historically-accurate, "adult" mentality that makes them not really think of their hobby as play, even though running operations is just that.<br/><br/>In my experience, there's something similar going on with a lot of minis gamers; they obviously love assembling/painting their little people and crafting meticulously detailed scenery, but it often feels (to hippy dippy, toy loving me) that they are also pretty invested in serious "adult fun" components like accuracy, detail, and historical realism (including fidelity to a fictional history, for fantasy gamers). In other words, the <i>modeling component</i> pushes back against the <i>play</i> component of what they do.<br/><br/>I think that "adult fun" and toy joy components can fit together, as they do for Bob, but that the match perhaps isn't as natural as it is for "real" toys like Lego. <br/><br/>Two examples:<br/>1) I know serious minis gamers who will deny that what they do is playing with toys, whereas adult Lego fans rarely have that issue! <br/>2) Even during the play/game phase, minis gamers often (thing not always!) rely on simulation as their dominant paradigm for play. This is intrinsically more "adult" than the doll house / floor play that Bob is describing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460456/#Comment_460456" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-20T16:41:15+00:00" title="February 20, 2017  4:41PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I'm still going to post pictures of the zone thing when I have time and am not on the phone!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460459/#Comment_460459" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-20T17:30:49+00:00" title="February 20, 2017  5:30PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I agree that the toy nature of LEGO aids the sort of game play discussed here, I think there are folks who use more traditional miniatures that would not be alienated by the types of play discussed in this thread.<br/><br/>My go to inspiration for less serious miniatures gaming is:<br/><br/>Major General Tremorden Rederring's Colonial-era Wargames Page<br/><br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071228014907/http://www.zeitcom.com/majgen/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20071228014907/http://www.zeitcom.com/majgen/index.html</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460463/#Comment_460463" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-20T18:37:25+00:00" title="February 20, 2017  6:37PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2017 6:54PM by komradebob.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I steal lots of practical ideas from Mjr Gen Tremorden, especially about "toy" scaling and using mixed scales on the table at the same time.<br/><br/>Off-hand, things I've stolen:<br/><br/>Making gunboats in the fashion of toys, rather than scale models<br/>Simplifying structures down to functional essentials<br/>The whole section on making "mountains" for NW Frontier fights ( it's where I got the idea of the fa\xe7ade approach to city buildings)<br/>Smaller scale ( usually 1/72) aircraft with 28mm gaming minis<br/><br/><br/>Stephen P:<br/>Yup, everything you just said.

For me, it's not just the re-usability but, most importantly, the potential recombination.  Each minifigure has nine basic parts plus accessories like hats, hair, tools, weapons, etc. that can be recombined in a large variety of ways.  If you buy one minifigure, it can be taken apart and and its parts recombined with any of the others in your collection.  The figures aren't fix in that way.  The players have a lot of choice in creating the representation of their character (it's part of the play).  And they're also pose-able in a limited fashion.  So not fixed in that way either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460486/#Comment_460486" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-21T14:44:51+00:00" title="February 21, 2017  2:44PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hopeless_Wanderer<br/><br/>There are certainly some string positives in the toys themselves. For my purposes, it's actually the positive attitudes of Lego fans that make me think this would be a more productive direction for me to take in the future (gearing my thinking and presentation of concepts to Lego fans, rather than trying to swim upstream against other fandoms' existing conceptions).<br/><br/>The key one is really just that gamers who are also Lego fans deal with their toys as toys.<br/><br/>Stephen P pretty much nails it, and why it's different and important in this context.<br/><br/>I recall reading, ages ago, S. John Ross talking about presenting his game<i> Risus</i>. He ended up presenting it with goofy examples and illustrated with stick figures. He presented it as comedy.<br/><br/>It wasn't because it couldn't be used for "serious" gaming, and IIRC, he already knew that. Presenting it as comedy was sugar on the pill, the thing that made it more easily accepted by people encountering it, and who later, on their own, figured out that it was actually perfectly usable for "serious" gaming as well.<br/><br/>That's a bit of how I'm tending to think of this stuff now.<br/>______________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>BTW, just a little explanation about why I haven't really considered Lego, but have been all about gaming miniatures<br/><br/>It has to do with the socio-economic class I grew up in. I just plain grew up working-poor, and Lego were too expensive for my family to afford. Now bags of plastic army men ( and other similar stuff) were affordable, and with the weirdness of working-poor economics, so were action figures. The love for those sorts of toys later translated into a love of gaming minis.<br/><br/>In my present day circumstances, I'm working-class in income, but I also never really developed common hobbies and expenditure habits that friends consider inherent. It sometimes leads to weird discussions, and when I explain, maybe you can relate.<br/><br/>When I talk about gaming minis with friends IRL, often I get a response a bit like:<br/><br/>"They're neat, you're collection is cool, but <i>daaaayyumm</i> that stuff is expensive!"<br/><br/>Putting aside some very big differences in approach to budgeting, credit use, etc, let me just point to one aspect probably almost everyone here can relate to: Usually the person is a committed electronic gamer of some kind, console, computer, whatever. Very likely, a bunch of you are as well.<br/><br/>Think about all of the money, added up, you've spent on electronic games over say, two and a half decades. It probably adds up to a fair bit, even with some highly developed bargain hunting skills.<br/><br/>Right. I never developed that as an interest ( again, tying back to that working-poor socio-economic background environment I grew up in). My discretionary spending went to minis.<br/><br/>So my spending on minis has been <i>instead of</i> electronic games and related gear, rather than <i>in addition to</i> electronic games.<br/><br/>Combined with some other budgeting/spending/saving/bargain-hunting strategies, it explains how a working class dude of modest means can have gaming minis as a hobby, despite how godawful expensive they look from an outsider perspective.<br/><br/>From an outsider perspective looking in on the console game expenditures of these same friends my calculations on their spending looks a bit like this ( and just all averaged out as current dollars and assuming MSRP*):<br/><br/>Core console system $300<br/>A total end collection of about 20 games at $50/game: $1000<br/><br/>Rough total per console system by the time it's done being used: $1300<br/><br/>Estimated time they stick with that system before going on to another one: 5 years<br/><br/>Averaged out, it's under $25/month over five years, and about 4 games per year purchased. So not really a crazy money dump by any means.<br/><br/>So, over 20 years, about $5200.<br/><br/>That's about how long I've had minis as a hobby as an adult.<br/><br/>(*Everyone presumably does bargain buying, as I do with minis, so let's just go with MSRP and assume it's a wash in the end.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460505/#Comment_460505" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-21T23:37:43+00:00" title="February 21, 2017 11:37PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2017 11:49PM by Hopeless_Wanderer.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Bob, I'm sure that you have a great mini collection (I think I've seen pictures of your Braunstein games), and I'm not trying to convert you into a Lego-head.<br/><br/>But for others out there reading this who are thinking about giving this a try but are worried about the hight cost of LEGO, there are other LEGO-compatible brands, KRE-O and Mega-Blocks are just two examples.  There are others.  LEGO isn't the only game in town, any more.  There are cheaper alternatives.  LEGO purists would probably shudder at the thought, but I'm not a purist.  The play is more important than Brand loyalty.  <br/><br/>And you can also buy used-LEGO on eBay and at yard-sales. LEGO is washable, there are instructions for washing it on the internet.  <br/><br/>The cost doesn't have to be a prohibitive factor. <br/><br/>---<br/>On somewhat related topic, for the mini folks that might be thinking about LEGO, there is a rather large cottage-industry in third-party custom parts and decals.  And people are painting, dying and sculpting their LEGO minifigures and accessories.

It may be interesting that the thing I've mostly considered Legos for is D&amp;D dungeoneering and similar regimented grid games. Seems to me like this takes the best advantage of the grid inherent in the blocks (a foot per dot or so I guess, if the Lego men are to scale). Of course one could think in terms of drama games, too, but that grid sure is suggestive...<br/><br/>The necessary inventory for trying this out doesn't seem that bad, really: a few plates, lots of wall bricks to build dungeon walls from, and a pile of Lego men. Perhaps most of them green for goblins and other humanoid monsters (no need to distinguish to begin with), and the rest yellow for properly caucasian heroic adventurers. Everything else on top of a gridded floor, walls and little men is bonus, after all.<br/><br/>For the sort of dungeoneering play I'm envisioning one would presumably build the walls notionally, one brick high, instead of trying for some sort of ceiling height. This makes the building process quick enough to do on the fly, allowing the "lego view" to double as a sort of real-time map, which would be half of the point for D&amp;D use of terrain props in any case. So instead of pre-building sets you could just build as you go.<br/><br/>This sounds so simple that I wonder why more people don't do this. It's a bit more involved than the "battlemat, pencils and dice" playscape we ended up using again last Wednesday, but not much. If I had a respectable pile of legos gathering dust in the house I might as well try this out any time.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>It may interest you to know, Bob, that your incessant babbling about miniatures play inspired me to look into using paper miniatures for <i>Fables of Camelot</i>, and perhaps some other things on the back burner. No idea yet if this'll amount to anything, but whatever it takes to avoid the real chores, you know.<br/><br/>As I think I've mentioned earlier, I find paper an amiable medium because of the non-commerciality, and the relative independence from a procurement process. It is theoretically possible, provided the proper skills and visual paradigm, to end up capable of making a miniature for anything you want without having to buy them prefab. Sort of like being your own minis sculpter (which is, of course, something that my crazier minis-hobbyist friends do as well).<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9536425/Paper%20minis%20pattern.jpg" style="float: left;" width="200px"/>I'm currently at version 2.3 of my paper miniature chassis (the cut-and-fold pattern, I mean). I guess I might as well show where I'm at. Two of these go on a single A4 sheet, and you can either position some art on it prior to printing, or print it, draw on it and then cut and fold.<br/><br/>(The end result of that pattern is basically a 40mm wide box 65 mm high. Pretty sturdy for being made of paper, and with four sides to put art on. The top and bottom can be opened, and it folds flat for storage. Glue may be used as preferred.)<br/><br/>I started development on this with a somewhat bigger form factor in mind, something more like a paper puppet than a paper figure - the better to facilitate toy-like drama play as opposed to positional tactical play. However, I'm currently focused on the tactile element, which I was not happy with in my bigger paper puppet; it was too light-weight to feel like a proper playing piece. The solution I am currently testing, which determined much about the form factor here, is to slip 1-3 Poker chips inside the piece to give it some heft. The scale of the piece is directly derived from the Poker chip, of course: the figure fits a normal 38mm chip quite snuggly.<br/><br/>Running this train of thought to the station, now I'm stuck with a paper miniature with a size that is sort of suggestive of a tactical miniature: it handles well on tabletop and is so small that the art doesn't really pop unless the players lean a bit closer to focus on the playing pieces. It is, however, just barely too large to fit comfortably on my Chessex battlemat, so it might not be a good idea to mass-produce 30 of these and try to run a D&amp;D session with them, either. Too small for puppet theater, and just maybe a little too big for comfortable minis gaming <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460742/#Comment_460742" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-27T13:34:20+00:00" title="February 27, 2017  1:34PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://cn.bing.com/images/search?q=paper+miniatures&amp;qpvt=paper+miniatures&amp;qpvt=paper+miniatures&amp;qpvt=paper+miniatures&amp;FORM=IGRE" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://cn.bing.com/images/search?q=paper+miniatures&amp;qpvt=paper+miniatures&amp;qpvt=paper+miniatures&amp;qpvt=paper+miniatures&amp;FORM=IGRE</a><br/><br/>juniorgeneral.org  Check out their forum as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460743/#Comment_460743" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-27T14:30:54+00:00" title="February 27, 2017  2:30PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I wouldn't use peg counting with Lego for the same reason I don't think it's all that necessary with gaming minis.<br/><br/>Instead, I would build a Lego Film crew, and use those to define the area as needed for each scene.<br/><br/>I found this image online:<br/><a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/72825" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ideas.lego.com/projects/72825</a><br/><br/>Something like that.<br/><br/>Combine that with some basic concepts in defining locations ahead of time, and it should work a treat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460781/#Comment_460781" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-28T14:40:46+00:00" title="February 28, 2017  2:40PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, apparently some Lego fans are working on a D&amp;D set:<br/><a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/92492/introducing-dungeons-dragons-inspired-lego-set" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://mentalfloss.com/article/92492/introducing-dungeons-dragons-inspired-lego-set</a><br/><br/>My understanding is that a whole bunch of stuff already exists that could be easily used, however.<br/><br/>As for paper...Hmm. Much like Lego, it's outside of my experience, so I simply hadn't given it much consideration. On further reflection, I'd imagine that someone deeply into origami or other paper arts could do some really amazing stuff. Given my apparently poor origami skills, the thought is easily as intimidating to me as the idea of picking up the skills associated with gaming minis and terrain building is for others.<br/><br/>OTOH, having seen some wonderful origami creations and having an inkling of the way paper pattern/texture/color plays into the creation of origami stuff, yeah, I could see something very cool coming out of exploring it as an option. When I think origami, I tend to think animal figures, so I could see a whole animal based fairy tale type game being played out.<br/><br/>As for Eero's suggestion about a basic use of Lego...well, that's my level of skill. OTOH, I'd imagine that a Lego Head would likely want a bit more than that, the same way I'd want a bit more than some miniatures on a dry erase grid. It seems functional, but getting a bit away from what makes Lego fun.<br/><br/>The exact level of intricacy to a layout or individual locations would necessarily be an area of compromise, much like it is with gaming minis.<br/><br/>Here's a question for the Lego fans:<br/><br/>What is the scoop with those green "base" pieces? Do they come in only one size or several standardized sizes? Other colors? With some molded terrain? ( I seem to recall some moonscape ones with craters built in).<br/><br/>I was thinking that one option might be to incorporate that stuff somehow into area-definition methods/rules, which then has an impact on movement rules and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460783/#Comment_460783" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-28T15:34:26+00:00" title="February 28, 2017  3:34PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those baseplates come in several sizes, though I don't know if Lego still manufactures the smaller ones, and over time there has been a good amount of variety; solid color ones, flat roadway surfaces with pegged borders, the moonscape piece that you mentioned (a beloved classic), printed designs (I had a pirate island hideaway that was blue around the edges and then transitions to sand and ground, and a smaller one with a river cutting through it), and cetera.

I think I know what you mean, but I'm trying to visualize it.</blockquote>\nBasically, you set up the tabletop with various zones placed relative to each other. The orientation and distances between zones are not realistic, but give a sense of general relationships. Then, for each zone, rather than sculpting terrain in a realistic/representational fashion, you instead set up some scenery that is symbolic or iconic for the area. The piece(s) of scenery are "centers of gravity" that define a zone--minis near the iconic/symbolic object are in that zone. Note that I call these "centers of gravity" rather than "zones" or "areas" because the borders are strictly fuzzy. This allows for flexibility--for example, if two adjacent areas are fictionally far apart, you can move a mini to the intermediate area to show their impending arrival (like the traditional "edge of the board" reinforcements). This also means that the scenery can be realistic/fitted to the scale, or can be merely symbolic ("The green felt is a bunch of brambles.")<br/><br/>Here's an example, also to illustrate the mixed-scales comment that I made above. This isn't an actual play photo--I just grabbed a few things that I had out/on top of my boxes and staged this scene in 90 seconds or so. But it works to illustrate how this might work in practice.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sc/hewh91g2zev2u9c/AADTaQH-QEx2NshrWw5dR9aGa" rel="nofollow">Top-Down View</a><br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sc/bxzsl4wkoap52o0/AACz-E-ucWS-ohBfkUBlGAJza" rel="nofollow">Front-On View</a><br/><br/>Basically, there are three areas. The first area is rocky terrain where several demon warriors (tieflings? lava men?) are fighting a shadow bear (a Duplo-scale bear cub figure, 4x bigger than minifig scale). The demon warriors have an ally, armed with a bow, in the nearby forest--the second area, represented by a tree. Finally, the third area is the river, from where the mother shadow bear is approaching to teach the demon warriors about pain. Note that each area has different levels of details represented in the scenery--the "river" is the Lego equivalent of a scrap of blue felt (which I also use); the rocks are to scale and custom built for the scene; and the tree is pretty close to scale, but way out of scale compared to the other scenery, and has been reused (from my medieval town layout).<br/><br/>The scenery centers a fuzzy zone, which greatly simplifies movement. At skirmish scale, for example, I tend to play that players can freely move around within a zone, or can spend their turn moving from one zone to another. (This captures the melee feel of medieval war movies pretty well. Based on the relative position of the figures, you can also still represent engaged combatants, which allows you to include things like Attacks of Opportunity, if you so choose. I usually don't, but I've done it before, and it works fine.) Ranged attacks can usually--in the fantasy milieu I prefer--reach to adjacent zones. So, the archer guy could fire into the melee with the bear (which probably has cover or a chance of hitting his allies, if you're using such a ruleset), or he could move into melee with the bear cub for his turn. Likewise, the mother bear will need to spend a turn moving before she enters the rocky area with her cub. (Again, you could make this as crunchy as you want--for example, say that crossing the river counts as difficult terrain, so the mother bear will need two turns, or she needs to pass a Swim/Strength check not to stop her movement in the stream, or whatever you'd like in terms of mechanics). <br/><br/>If it hasn't been clear, I've used the Center of Gravity approach with a range of rulesets, from 3.5 D&amp;D to freeform toy play. It works amazingly well, even with crunchy, tactical-positional games like 3.5.<br/><br/>There are a few benefits to the Center of Gravity approach, all of which come from its flexibility. <br/>1) For example, the scenery can be highly detailed--e.g. a full interior of a building, completely detailed--or it can be schematic, like the pile of rocks I built from Lego in 8 seconds. Thus, players can engage in lonely fun creating detailed iconic/symbolic scenery for important, recurring places, as they desire, but can also just literally anything for a quick transitory zone (e.g. "You hear the scraping sounds coming from the well, which is over by this quarter." *lays quarter down in corner of playing area*). <br/>2) The level of investment in material thus can reflect the time and inclination of players--I can totally see a game with several people committed to the material toys who invest time crafting (and reusing!) detailed scenery for a given zone--say, a medieval market square surrounded by several buildings, and peopled with vendors, carts, a well, etc.<br/>3) The approach scales--use mini-sized scenery for skirmish scale zones, but use icons of whole biomes or cities to show zones for a larger geographic area. I could see a fun game based around the maneuvering of various kingdoms, for examples, which the play area forming a sort of interactive map--kinda like one of the Civ video games, but with minis that you can physically interact with. In any case, point being that the area symbolized by the figure/scenery as the center of gravity can represent an area of any scale.<br/><br/>Edit: Apparently Dropbox will no longer allow you to directly embed images through HTML.

Therefore that 24" of open ground between the shooter and the target might be a hundred yards or more, while the 12" between two minis in the same building might be less than ten yards.<br/></blockquote>\nSo, even in the context of people talking about very traditional miniatures skirmish game design, there is some similar recognition of flexible distance/selective compression/abstract distance going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460889/#Comment_460889" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-04T00:10:47+00:00" title="March  4, 2017 12:10AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>One of the things about Lego that strikes me as a least slightly different from gaming minis is that building cool stuff ( scenery / terrain especially ) is more open to everyone involved, but still takes a bit of time.</blockquote>\nSo, in my mind, here's how you go about it.  You say to your players, "Hey, next Saturday afternoon we're going to play our LEGO Story-game. The genre is classic castle"  You tell each player to bring a setting MOC.  "Bob, you bring a microscale exterior; Chris you bring a heroica scale interior; Eerro, you bring a minfigure scale interior; Frank, you bring a heroica scale exterior; and Stephen, you bring a minifigure scale interior, etc."  Players build what they want based on the theme.  The GM supplements with monsters, NPCs, a few other setting builds, etc.  Maybe the GM could even assign NPC creation tasks to the group too.  Everyone comes together on Saturday with what they've built.  You play your story, randomizing how the MOC and characters show up in the story.  Players have creative building input and narrative input because you're going to use their MOC at some point during the session, guaranteed.  It's collaborative AND sandboxy because the GM will never know what MOC will show up at any particular session.  She'll only know that the theme/genre will be similar/appropriate.  Everyone keeps their build a secret.  Even if two players build the same thing (which is unlikely, because you split up the tasks and scales, but could happen), two "castle gates" for example, they don't have to be the from the same castle.  One could be the players home castle gate, the other could be the villain's castle gate.  As long as everyone is clear about the genre expectations, you'll always have enough interesting stuff for a session.  Nobody will know how anything will get used until play starts.  Maybe you build a monster NPC thinking it will be the villain, but during play it actually turns out to be a donor, or mentor, or victim-to-be-rescued.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460901/#Comment_460901" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-04T13:36:49+00:00" title="March  4, 2017  1:36PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, that seems pretty practical, having a preliminary session ( probably pretty short) to get things started.<br/><br/>Heck, some of that could be done by e-mail I guess. You wouldn't even have to be F2F to spread that out.<br/><br/>How much input do you think the initiating player/GM should shoot for with something like that? Where is the sweet spot between giving inspiration and being to micromanaging?<br/><br/>I do like that though. I'm envisioning something where the plot/situation/important character mix isn't completely pre-determined, but only happens as play happens.<br/><br/>( I like Mythic GME a bunch, and the suggestion about the In A Wicked Age approach seems like it would work well for that too).<br/><br/>As a follow up, how could you see follow up and expansion on that working after an initial session? I mean things like expansion of the initial stuff paralleling the expansion of the in-play fictional stuff ( or changes to it)?<br/><br/>I could also see that being part of the fun of Lego play, as

4:00PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see this working in one of two ways:<br/><br/>1) Assuming that the GM said, "Bob, you bring a microscale exterior; Chris you bring a heroica scale interior; Eero, you bring a minfigure scale interior; Frank, you bring a heroica scale exterior; and Stephen, you bring a minifigure scale interior, etc."  <br/><br/>This might happen:<br/>*Bob builds/brings a microscale peasant's farm with hut, field, fence, and animals.<br/>*Chris builds/brings a heroica scale cave network with some interesting, potential "rooms" but nothing else.  Nothing is "labelled" yet.<br/>*Eero builds/brings a  minifigure scale medieval monastery library--perhaps just enough to imply the whole thing but not the actual whole thing.  Maybe a scriptorium desk, some scrolls and a bookshelf all on a small baseplate.  Maybe a monk thrown in for set-dressing. <br/>*Frank builds/brings a heroica scale castle wall section and gate house.<br/>*Stephen builds/brings a minifigure scale goblin-king throne room.  Again, just enough to imply it without building the whole thing.<br/>*the GM has some standard stuff build as well--a short section of road, maybe a lone tree, a well,  a small copse of trees to imply a forest, a small castle gate house, a castle passage way, a small stone bridge, and maybe a cave wall or passage, maybe some stairs.  All of this at minifigure scale (probably, but not necessarily).<br/><br/>The players and GM arrive on Saturday, and play to find out how all this fits together.  Pick one place as the starting point, and link it all together as the play and narrative evolve over the course of the play session.  Maybe the peasant farmer has information about a mysterious cave network, and the monastery library is hidden in the cave network, and there is a scroll on the bookshelf that will teleport the characters to the goblin-king's throne room, etc.  Anything else you need, you build quickly.  Maybe you need a minifigure scale piece of that peasant's fence.  That's a 30 second build, and it wouldn't really interrupt the narrative to build it.  How you determine how this all links together (your rules) is another part of the game system that deserves it's own thread.<br/><br/>2) The second way is a lot like the first, except you craft some random tables before hand. My re-birth into RPGaming is really through John Harper's Pocket Danger Patrol, and that's what I'm thinking about here.  Your table is genre specific and has a style and role for each possible place.  Perhaps:<br/><br/>2d6  style         role               int/ext        scale<br/>2    ghostly    monastary      int               minfigure<br/>3    faerie      hill                  ext<br/>4   goblin      forest              int<br/>5   undead    castle              ...<br/>6   peasant    ...                   ...<br/>7   royal        ... <br/>...<br/><br/>I'm not going to make the whole table--I think you get the idea.  You have a descriptive adjective and a noun (place).  The players build what they can think of based on the hints that table has givne them.  Then you meet as before (i.e. method #1) and play it out.  Maybe Frank rolls a 7, 3, 3, 1 = royal, hill, ext, minifigure.  He decides to build a small hill in minifigure scale with the foundation remains of an old royal tower that fell down years ago.<br/><br/>You could do the same thing for threats and NPCs.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460904/#Comment_460904" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-04T16:03:53+00:00" title="March  4, 2017  4:03PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My table didn't format well, there were supposed to be five partial columns.  <br/><br/>You're other questions, I'll have to answer tomorrow.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460905/#Comment_460905" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-04T16:09:51+00:00" title="March  4, 2017  4:09PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            your                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460915/#Comment_460915" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-05T11:42:04+00:00" title="March  5, 2017 11:42AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>How much input do you think the initiating player/GM should shoot for with something like that? Where is the sweet spot between giving inspiration and being to micromanaging?</blockquote>I can't say.  I'm ambivalent about that, literally.   The GM knows what monsters and treasure he/she has at their disposal.  That would be a factor, but I don't know if it is the only factor or most important factor.  I'm seeing the GM as playing as the environment and elements (like was mentioned in that other thread about D&amp;D-wargames.\n<blockquote>I'm envisioning something where the plot/situation/important character mix isn't completely pre-determined, but only happens as play happens.</blockquote>I'm envisioning something like that.  The GM has a stable of monsters and NPC and they appear when appropriate.  You build your random encounter table based on what you have, rather than building some perfect simulationist random encounter table for the genre and trying to buy the toys to fill it out. If we don't have any skeletons, then we're not going to encounter them.<br/><br/>`Plot' happens as play happens.\n<blockquote>( I like Mythic GME a bunch, and the suggestion about the In A Wicked Age approach seems like it would work well for that too).</blockquote>\nI don't really know what your talking about here.  I'm kinda new to modern indie RPGs.  I was out of gaming for about 30 years, and the only modern games I've played are one's that I've downloaded and printed (for free).\n<blockquote>As a follow up, how could you see follow up and expansion on that working after an initial session? I mean things like expansion of the initial stuff paralleling the expansion of the in-play fictional stuff ( or changes to it)?</blockquote>Well, most LEGO-heads could probably go 3-4 sessions without having to tear anything apart in order to build something new.  So, you've still got all the stuff you built for the previous sessions.  Maybe the players want to go inside the castle that Frank partially built, or explore the whole cave network that Chris build.  You start building out those areas at a larger scale with more detail.  On the other hand, the story and/or the players might want to go in a totally different direction, and then you're back to the same setup as the first session.  At the end of each session you make a decision as a group where you're going with the story and the play, so that you can build for the next session.\n<blockquote>I could also see that being part of the fun of Lego play, as the world and cast develops.</blockquote>I agree.  I think "build the world as you go alone" is the best approach both in terms of player engagement and not stretching anyone's budget too much.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460916/#Comment_460916" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-05T12:06:27+00:00" title="March  5, 2017 12:06PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "...as you go along"...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460917/#Comment_460917" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-05T12:52:44+00:00" title="March  5, 2017 12:52PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Geez, I don't think either of those games has freebie demoes available, but here's a review of In <i>A Wicked Age</i>:<br/><a href="https://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13669.phtml" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13669.phtml</a><br/><br/>And here's a link to a whole bunch of Oracle generators:<br/><a href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=In_a_Wicked_Age" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=In_a_Wicked_Age</a><br/><br/>Mythic GM Emulator is a bit of an odd duck.

You might just do searches to see if you can find more info on that one.*<br/><br/>In any case, it's a nifty game/tool too.<br/><br/>Both IAWA and MGME have tools that tend to bring things together, in terms of scene locations, developing plots events, and characters ( and characters in both games get a bit fuzzy on whether they're PCs or NPCs in some ways. It's likely that players will have a main character and sometimes play a couple of other characters as well that they portray as needed).<br/><br/>Mythic GM Emulator is part of a bigger product, a full on generic RPG, called Mythic RPG, funny enough. There's also an expansion called Mythic Variants, that tweaks some of the charts based on genre and gives further tools for self-tweaking custom charts.<br/><br/>I think it's nice to have the full Mythic RPG, but I find it optional for most of my purposes.<br/><br/>From poking around at different sites I visit, it seems like MGME has gotten a small fanbase among (semi)solo miniatures (war) gamers, who seem to love it far more than RPGers do generally.<br/><br/><br/>* electronic formats create this weird moral dilemma for me. If I had a physical book, and we were geographically close,  I could just loan you the thing to read and no one would blink, since I paid for the thing and can do what I want with it. With e-formats, I guess I can share as much as I want with my local play group, but it creates a weird dilemma even if I want o share it with someone local not in my play group. I certainly feel like folks who have gone through the effort to create something for sale should get money for it, but it makes sharing both easier on one hand and harder on the other.

I can't figure out how to prevent the players from all rolling the same "int/ext" and scale.  It wouldn't work if everyone came with a microscale build, or if everyone build an interior, and their were no exterior setting pieces.  Maybe the GM could do all the rolling and send the oracle results to each player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460923/#Comment_460923" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-05T15:56:13+00:00" title="March  5, 2017  3:56PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            argh!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460924/#Comment_460924" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-05T15:58:23+00:00" title="March  5, 2017  3:58PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry about that mess.

(I'll give more detail and rationale later.) In short, in every session, I'd have the group spend some time building together, and then some time playing the story. <br/><br/>First, folks would decide what needs to be built. In an old school sandbox, for example, the players could decide where they'd adventure this week, then the GM could divvy up tasks (A makes stuff for a cultist den, B builds a cool demon, C makes some cave dressings, etc.). In a dirty hippie game, folks could decide locations that they'd like to see appear (which would obviously imply characters, as well); in our political intrigue game, I might build some set dressing for the Queen's bedchamber, for example, as a way of pre-framing a scene (or multiple scenes) there, which we would cooperatively put into play.<br/><br/>Either way, I wouldn't have folks build full tableaus. In most cases, some representative objects or scenery (set dressing, basically) is ideal: an ornate bed and lamp for the Queen's chamber; stalagtites and rocky bits and a pool for the caves; bunks and a guard tower for the goblin lair, etc.<br/><br/>(More on my rationale/the benefits of this approach soon!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460934/#Comment_460934" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-06T00:30:23+00:00" title="March  6, 2017 12:30AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rationale:<br/><br/>1. Engagement<br/>Pragmatically speaking, it's likely that this project would be driven by one person who is most invested in the idea of a LEGO-based toy/story game. By building together rather than as "homework," less-engaged players may be more likely to continue participating, allowing for multi-session games (as desired).<br/><br/>2. Logistics<br/>Not everyone will have extensive (or any!) Legos, but all may still contribute. By building together, the project driver/host could allow his personal collection to be used in the cooperative building phase. I can easily see a situation where one or two other players (in addition to the motivated host) might be interested in bringing along more detailed lonely-fun creations. This is entirely compatible with still holding a cooperative build phase, and indeed would allow the game to flexibly accommodate a range of motivations/dedication to building! <br/><br/>3. Skill<br/>The more advanced builders could work on the more advanced projects, while novices could begin with simple set dressing (cave or outdoor features, simple buildings, etc.). The challenge of building could thus be suited to individual skill and preparation. Novices could also learn techniques from better builders, which would allow for a sort of system mastery fun (the joy of learning/expertise).<br/><br/>4. Socialization! <br/>Building together is fun! This embraces the Toy Joy aspect of the project, wherein the building is not merely preparation, but is an intrinsic part of the game experience. This is crucial to a "real" Lego game, in my opinion.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460935/#Comment_460935" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-06T00:40:57+00:00" title="March  6, 2017 12:40AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2017 12:55AM by Stephen P.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Questions to be answered:<br/><br/>1. What's a good ratio of build to play time in a given session? <br/><br/>This might vary--a first session might need more initial building, or the beginning of a new act (location, dungeon, time period, cast, etc.). Other sessions might reuse sets or progressively add to/modify them. This also will vary based on players' interest and the length of a session, and can easily be adapted to different groups' needs.<br/><br/>With all that said, my personal preference would be for 3-4 hour sessions total that are about 1/3 to 1/4 building (I.e. 45 to 60 minutes of building per session). So, roughly a 1:3 ratio of build to play.<br/><br/>I'd formalize the phases: an initialization phase, where we recap what happened last session (if multi-session play) and decide building needs based on whatever procedure (GM list or assignment, dirty hippie collective decisions, debate and discussion, individual contributors that will be stitched together exquisite-corpse style, oracle generation ala Hopeless Wanderer's great suggestion, whatever.)<br/><br/>2. What's the best way to formalize the procedure for the building phase? <br/><br/>I'd incline toward different approaches for different games, as decided by the group (or as part of the pitch). There's no reason not to vary from session to session, as the group's needs evolve. So, I'd recommend the "menu" approach above.<br/><br/>What else would need to be ironed out, in terms of procedures? <br/><br/>I've never tried a game like this, but now I'm INCREDIBLY excited to try it! I'll probably work on a one-shot procedure to begin with, in which I provide all the Legos and host, because that would be easiest to terms of buy-in and logistics. Then I'd kit-bash toward multisession play as I find the opportunity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460936/#Comment_460936" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-06T00:49:14+00:00" title="March  6, 2017 12:49AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Either way, I wouldn't have folks build full tableaus.

These can be bought new in battle packs (four related minifigs with accessories); individually BrickLinked; collected over time from one Theme (or similar Themes); or, most economically, found at yard sales! (Lego ABS is durable and easy to wash.)<br/><br/>-- Collect lots of various minifig accessories: headgear/hair, backpacks and neck accessories, torsos, legs (including short legs, dresses, etc), waist accessories, and anything and everything that can be held (weapons, food, mundane household items, tools). The more you collect, the more combinations are possible (exponentially).<br/><br/>-- Save generic set dressing. That pile of rocks, tree/copse, generic storefront, crumbling tower, whatever can easily be reused.<br/><br/>-- Add complexity over time. Unlike traditional minis terrain, it doesn't have to be done to be pretty/compete. Add to important sets over time, as the need arises. (Principle: Toy detail reflects the diegetic importance of a place/thing.) (Also, we need to collect Principles for our manifesto. I've been hinting at some as I go-- I'll take a stab at formalizing some key ones soon! Our manifesto needs sections on principles and procedures, including menus of procedural options to adapt to different purposes.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460938/#Comment_460938" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-06T01:01:34+00:00" title="March  6, 2017  1:01AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good Lord, I'm overcaffinated.

My browser won't let me preview or edit anything on this site.</blockquote>\nI've had similar problems, so I feelz ya!<br/><br/>What if we combined your idea with Stephen's idea, but went with cards and people chose which ones to build as part of a session's building-time phase?<br/><br/>The cards are relatively open to interpretation, and maybe some of them are repeated, but it's somehow up to the players as a group to choose which to use for the basis of their part of the project?<br/><br/>The GM/Initiating player ( and I'm just going to say GM from here onward, because we all know what I'm talking about) still has a whole lot of control over initial "vision" by creating the initial card mix and probably also bringing the bulk of the Lego blocks to use.<br/><br/>That GM Vision Thing:<br/><br/>When I tried a couple of experiments with minis games like this ( one went really well, one went okay-ish. In the okay-ish one, the players had fun while I considered it a mixed success at best) I had an idea of what I was looking for in the scenario.<br/><br/>I found it was bit of a tight-rope to walk in terms of shared creativity.<br/><br/>I front-loaded a good bit of general setting stuff, and also kept to myself some concepts that I might choose to throw in if things started to bog down. But none of it had to be used, and if things started going in a very different direction, but the group as a whole seemed to dig it, I ran with what they were doing.<br/><br/>At some level, while that's all vague, I think it's the only practical approach.<br/><br/>Games almost need to start off as "The GM's Concept" and then evolve more into "This is our Collective Thing".<br/><br/>( Although...I also suspect that after a game or two, the participants become capable of doing a more truly collaborative creation of vision straight out of the gate).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460945/#Comment_460945" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-06T13:59:29+00:00" title="March  6, 2017  1:59PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stephen:<br/>Those sound like excellent rationales for the approach you're suggesting!<br/><br/>I also agree that principles revolving around the general concept are important to lay out, and that there are different principles involved that are best taken "menu" style depending on the type of game you're making from them.<br/><br/>I attempted to do something similar, geared towards gaming minis, but it became a wild, unwieldy google doc.<br/><br/>Here's the link:<br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y-W-h-Ogwi5Xbq167kej-SHE3ZehA7j2TmWtsAaWkKk/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y-W-h-Ogwi5Xbq167kej-SHE3ZehA7j2TmWtsAaWkKk/edit</a><br/><br/><br/>If any of you plunge into that thing, be prepared. It was written in fits and spurts of creativity over a couple of years. By that, I mean, I'd go back to it time and again, mess with some stuff for a day or two, then run out of steam.<br/><br/>Whole sections have been cut and moved around willy-nilly, so please don't expect anything like good flow, and any basic editing is equally haphazard.<br/><br/>It's also kinda lengthy. Sorry. It really was intended to be short...<br/><br/>Some of the better bits I realized while writing it up ( and yes, there are illustrations, if basic ones) has to do with physicality and use of space on a table.<br/><br/>They were written with an assumption/axiom that a table of some size was being used and  that play was going to take place on that table pretty much as created ( without a lot of modification) for the course of a given session. Of course, it could change between sessions.<br/><br/>That's notably a bit different from the approach in Eero's  game, where locations switched up between scenes, more like pre-made tiles or battle mats, using the center of the table where people were setting around it. Basically more like D&amp;D 4e was designed to be played.<br/><br/>Anyway, part of what I realized was that..<br/><br/>1) The 6" or so around the edge of the table was basically dead space. It was simply too close to the edge to use for anything important because of the way people stand and the likelihood of stuff being knocked off the table. You could still use that space for game related non-toy stuff though.<br/><br/>2) Locations of importance need to be placed around the table in such a way that it was almost circular or oval shaped, and generally you wanted to avoid putting anything too important in the center of the table if there was likely a problem at all reaching the center of the table.<br/><br/>3) If you were creating an important location, generally you wanted to space things so that at least three people could stand comfortably near one another and all interact with the space ( play with toys there).<br/><br/>All of that gets modified depending on the size and shape of the table of course, and there's no reason that locations can't be of different sizes and be connected together Tetris-like, but that aspect is worth thinking about.<br/><br/>It's also worth thinking about another kind of physicality when building locations too:<br/>You have to build it in such a way that 2-3 people can feasibly have their hands in there, interacting with the toys regularly.<br/><br/>That's also a pretty good argument for stylized/selectively compressed/ stage set/movie set style building, and not just because it makes the Lego blocks go further!<br/><br/>Using the example of the throne room set, yes it makes sense at some level to just build thee throne and the raised platform and define an area ( maybe a base if that's available) as being The Throne Room from a quick build concept rather than building the whole castle. But it's also a good approach from leaving it open enough to handle movement of figures and play in it.<br/><br/>I could see it more intricate, with some more items, but not a lot, and perhaps doors and windows are put in place, but not walls ( or maybe only one or two walls, or only 1/3 to 1/2 height walls).<br/><br/>A forest might have at least two trees, but probably doesn't have more than 5 unless it's supposed to be an especially big forest or a very dense forest.<br/><br/>Pirate ships are likewise cut down. 1 cannon for small ships, 2 ( either side) for a proper small gunboat or patrol boat, 4/6/8 for really grand vessels.<br/><br/>(Unless massive amounts of scenes and action are to take place on a given ship of course)<br/><br/>That sort of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460947/#Comment_460947" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-06T14:56:25+00:00" title="March  6, 2017  2:56PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, this thread has been a serious dam-buster.
