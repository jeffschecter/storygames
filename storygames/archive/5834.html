The rules are simple and I think they'll work in practice. I don't think it will be my go-to game for supers, exactly, but its lightweight vibe would be a good fit for certain types of supers -- I'm thinking Legion of Superheroes (the animated series), Ben 10, maybe The Tick.<br/><br/>I mostly bought it because I thought the presentation was really cool, and it didn't disappoint. The fact that there's also a functional little game in there, too, was a nice bonus. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130561/#Comment_130561" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T11:29:57+00:00" title="February 26, 2008 11:29AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2008 11:30AM by Andy.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My statement is exactly the same as John Harper's.<br/><br/>In fact, I ran a mini-game with my weekly group in the following way:<br/><br/>* Using the world setting of "Necessary Evil"<br/>* Using the rules of RISUS Supers<br/>* And the "super power mechanic" and coins of Supercrew (everyone has a single "1d6" ability, seperate from the others, where they succeed on a 5-6 only: Using it gives you a coin. Coin lets you double your dice for any other ability/schtick roll).<br/><br/>It's elegant and interesting to read. A true artifact of our hobby.<br/><br/>Edit: I got the PDF version.

I like the variant rules for T&amp;J much more than ZoZ. (i guess i could just say the different rules.)<br/><br/>here's my final opinion on the partial Supercrew that we played:<br/>1. our gm switching meant a minimum of dependable non-violent NPCs. this resulted in us using the system a lot, and having few scenes where there was no fighting. if a group was going to have more of what Christian (and i'm sure many others) have called "Free Play" where the players speak in character and the conflict resolution rules aren't used, well i'd imagine they'd have a better time.<br/>2. we changed systems partially because we wanted to better simulate some specific powers (which aren't necessarily offensively useful, especially in *every* situation) and also partially because we wanted to try something else. therefore Supercrew is not bad, we just wanted something else.<br/>3. we are also playing a "campaign" style, open-ended number of game sessions. my understanding of supercrew is that it dosen't support this well. if you want to throw down with a few friends on one evening or even on a long bus ride across town then this is a good option, especially if some are newer players. newer players in my group quickly grasped the rules. <br/><br/>there you go.<br/>i am hella tired and i keep having to retype everything because the fucking typos are haunting my fingers.<br/>happy leap day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Svante%20Landgraf" title="Svante Landgraf"><img alt="Svante Landgraf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Svante%20Landgraf">Svante Landgraf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131857/#Comment_131857" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-01T03:54:44+00:00" title="March  1, 2008  3:54AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's also a <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13300.phtml" rel="nofollow">review at rpg.net</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131886/#Comment_131886" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-01T08:49:39+00:00" title="March  1, 2008  8:49AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played it twice on a single pickup-gaming night, with two new people (one of whom was new to RPGs entirely). We learned it really quickly, so kudos to its readability and easy rules. It's a rules-light setup (Risus-esqe) and it was no problem together to throw together a team of superheros (as well as the chosen supervillain).<br/><br/>The system does encourage you to not just think about "how do I use this power here?", but also "how can this power get me into trouble now? (so that I can use Moar Powers later)". It was light-weight and stayed out of the way. So, definitely a solid pick for pickup superhoer gaming. (Granted, I can see the system wearing out a bit if you were playing a broader campaign and expecting some system support for it.)<br/><br/>The presentation is, as mentioned, fabulous.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
