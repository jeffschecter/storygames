I also heard it's not a good place to get caught committing a crime, and that they have a pretty broad definition of "crime." What have you heard about it?<br/><br/>I heard that the Denver Wolf likes to blow smoke like he's big time, but he's really just an upstart, penny-ante daimyo. But, then again, that's what they said about Nobunaga. What have you heard about him?<br/><br/>I heard that Hammurabi Musashi II, the warlord who just hegemonized the entirety of what used to be New Mexico, is actually a really fair and just ruler. I also heard that, before he was "Governor" of New Mexico, he had been a soldier, a slave, and an ascetic monk. Have you heard anything about him?<br/><br/>I heard that the Electric Light Overland Stage, a network of cable car trains ranging from most of the Rockies to the Mississippi and from the Great Lakes to the northern borders of the Holy Republic of Texas, secretly records conversations held in their cars, and sells any useful intelligence to the highest bidder. I also heard that, if you were to fly over it in a plane at night, it would look like an electrified spider's web. What have you heard about it?<br/><br/>I heard that the Valley of the Spill used to be home to the city of Holy Wood, a place where the young demigods of the old days congregated, before it was obliterated by the Spill. I also heard that it's full of vagrant, hungry ghosts who will murder you if you stay there too long.

While architecture remains their first "law", they have absorbed most of the region's biotech and medical industry, and are designing "improved" human beings.  Strangely, while strong, healthy and highly intelligent, these designed humans are universally short for some reason.  But despite this small flaw, ambitious potential parents make ELOS trip out to the Great Temple in the hopes of having an improved child.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AJohandsome" title="AJohandsome"><img alt="AJohandsome" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AJohandsome">AJohandsome</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345263/#Comment_345263" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-07T22:22:17+00:00" title="October  7, 2011 10:22PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You bet your mother's innocence the Toltecs are sorcerors. Now, it's nothing that the Holy Republic of Texas will ever admit to, but the Toltecs have found a way to tap into the Spine of the Land. They use that stuff to do all kinds of stir-crazy things. Last I heard was that they've set up shop right across the Mississippi, after the Cabal War ended, and that they've started building again. Don't go there to see for yourself, if you know what's good for you. Last I heard from a fella from upthatways was that they'd sent a Preacher out to deal with 'em, but he never came back. <br/><br/>I heard that a girl in Omaha can Speak with the Great Beast of Winter.

One winter's day she got away from her foster home, and lost in a blizzard.  She should have died in that storm, but when she thanked the storm out loud for covering her tracks so she could run away, it answered her.  The next day she was made a ward of the Elders.  She only wants to be the Beast's friend, nothing else.  If she had wanted something more, it would have likely never answered her.  Now, <i>the Elders</i> probably want to use the Beast as a weapon.  Good luck with that!<br/><br/>I've heard it said that the ghost of New Orleans can be seen some nights floating on the waters of the Gulf, and the if you're lucky (or unlucky) enough you can enter the City and take part in the Eternal <i>Mardi Gras</i>, but you can't ever leave.

Would explain the way they talk. It's all, "fork off bastardo!" and "Eat a scargo, beetch!" Whatever "eat a scargo" is s'posed to mean.<br/><br/>I heard that the recent Super-AIDS epidemic in the New Jersey region resulted from the recombo-DNA therapy they've been pioneering at the body mod clinics.

The pyramid holds many perils, including a curse, but it is said they also buried all his wealth with him. Given that he had conquered all of Nevada in his time, that's probably a lot of wealth...<br/><br/>Way I hear it, there's nothing left of Nawlins but those damned Dreaded Black Voodoo Snakes. Supposedly you can survive their curse-bite if someone sucks out the venom after coating their mouth with sacramental olive oil, but they'll probably still die unless you can appease Papa Legba, who is said to rule the boundaries between life and death 'round those parts. And who could've guessed that Nawlins was spelled "New Orleans"? Crazy shit.

Perhaps we self medicated to get some good rest, perhaps the spirits of the land infected us, but the paranoia grew and our dreams blurred into our waking world. The Cult of the Rainbow Serpent grew into the Holy Church of the Sky Leviathan, religious wars were fought through the shattered remains of the rusted cancerous cities. <br/><br/>The wayfarers came to cleanse the ancient highways, road, paths and songlines across the continent. They still have much work to do.<br/><br/>Most of the young have forgotten about far off lands with exotic names like such as U-rope and Armour-Eeka.
