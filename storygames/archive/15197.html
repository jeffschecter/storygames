An asymmetrical board game is a board game where not all the players are doing the same thing or trying to achieve the same thing.  Scotland Yard is an example.  Some of the players are police detectives trying to find Mr. X.  But one player is Mr. X who is trying to escape the police.  Betrayal At The House on the Hill is an interesting example because it starts out as a symmetrical board game (everyone is trying to level up their characters and do so following the same rules) but turns into an asymmetrical board game in the second half (now someone is the betrayer and everyone is following two sets of different rules).<br/><br/>I think of D&amp;D like an asymmetrical board game.  The DM does one thing and the PC are doing something else.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345591/#Comment_345591" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T14:58:06+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  2:58PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could play Warhammer Quest.

Anyway, I've heard this type of thing a lot and I have the inclination to think that Nathan had a bad experience with a GM. The way I see it, the role of a GM is similar to that of a police officer. Ideally, and on the surface, it's their job to help you. But beyond that, it's often seen a position of power which attracts people who want to abuse said power. I understand that police officers are there to 'serve and protect', but the power that comes along with the job attracts dick heads who want to throw their weight around and tell everyone else what to do. They want to be in charge and don't like it when their position of dominance is questioned. In other words, most cops give the good ones a bad name. Likewise, most GM's give the good ones a bad name.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345828/#Comment_345828" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-13T13:24:22+00:00" title="October 13, 2011  1:24PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had very talented capital G capital Ms.<br/>And no, I wasn't molested by my father, uncle or priest.
