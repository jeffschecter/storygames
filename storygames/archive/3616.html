It's a short improv/party game called 'Seance'. <br/><br/>A group of players sits down at a table (or on the floor) together.  Everyone takes a scrap of paper and rights down a job of some sort.  It could be "politician" or "coal miner" or what-have-you.  These papers are all folded and placed in the middle.  Each person randomly takes one of them and opens it up to read it.  If they end up taking their own, that's okay.  Then the papers are folded again and put back in the middle.<br/><br/>Then everyone closes their eyes, holding hands with the people next to them.  Someone starts out and says something like, "I see a man, an old man who has gone on to spirit. His name is Robert, ..." <br/><br/>And then silence until someone else speaks up with something to add.  What they add should have something to do with the job that they read on the paper.  Perhaps a mannerism or affectation or piece of clothing.  This goes around around the table randomly as people add to the vision and turn it in unexpected ways.  When a person has said their peace (it could be after one comment or five), they let go of their hands.  Only people who are still holding hands with someone may continue to speak.  <br/><br/>Once the last person gets their hand dropped by the other, they say goodbye to the spirit and open their eyes.<br/><br/>Not sure how it would play out, but with multiple people pulling in different directions using the "yes, and..." concept, it could get weird and creepy.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81291/#Comment_81291" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-15T05:49:38+00:00" title="July 15, 2007  5:49AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds kinda cool, but I'm tempted to say it needs another level. Usually these "spirits" have a VERY IMPORTANT, BUT VAGUE MESSAGE to deliver to the living. Often to a specific person who just so happens to be in the group. Is there a way you could incorporate a message to the living into the game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85580/#Comment_85580" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-04T20:42:49+00:00" title="August  4, 2007  8:42PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            wowsers, Chris, this is awesome!<br/><br/>i'm gonna get some folks to play this before too long, definitely. i wonder about the last stage of the game though- lets say you and daniel are still holding hands and clinton and i are still holding hands too (after all these years) AND on my other side is joe. so there's five people still playing. clinton says something sort of final sounding, and lets go my hand.<br/>since all of our eyes are closed, you and daniel don't know that joe and i are still in the game. if you and daniel both say a few things back and forth without joe or i making a comment, maybe you'll think we're not in the game anymore, and say goodbye to the spirit.<br/><br/>i would rectify this by throwing down some other rules, more in "spirit" of what you were saying earlier than in reaction to my band-aid. how's this: <br/><br/>no player may add more than five details.<br/>players, instead of holding hands, place palms together with fingers reaching up one another's wrists.<br/>all five fingertips on each hand touch their neighbor's wrists.<br/>each time a player adds a detail, they lift one of their fingertips away from from BOTH wrists that they are touching.<br/>once all a player's fingertips have been removed from a neighbor's wrist OR AT ANY TIME THEY ELECT TO,<br/>the player withdraws their hands to themselves and adds no more details.<br/>if both of a player's neighbor's withdraw their hands, then the middle player is out of the game, too.<br/><br/>// um. i haven't gotten to the part where this gets different from what Chris said yet, but my roommate just knowed on my door and announced "dinnertime", so i guess i gotta go.<br/><br/>more later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86353/#Comment_86353" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T18:48:27+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  6:48PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            how about (as a random way to get input) have a radio tuned to a talk radio station with the volume down?<br/>part of the game could involve turning the volume up loud enough to hear a few words, then down again.<br/>these things could be taken out of their context and made to indicate something vitally important that the spirit has to communicate.<br/><br/>long dinner. sorry about that.<br/><br/>sorry about the "thread necromancy" too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
