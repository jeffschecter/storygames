Definitely not a story game crowd because they view winning as primarily important. A perfect acid test for the versatility of the game.<br/><br/>First the players: Bob (I've mentioned him in previous threads) wants to win and taunt some, Mark (our host) like to win as a test of himself, and Dave a new game I don't know well. I am the fourth player - I like a little competition but get more pleasure from just playing the game. <br/><br/>We set up a smaller game with Rumpelstiltskin as the bad guy versus the Seven Dwarfs, the Police, and Jack (the Giant Killer). The game is essentially a revenge plot which ends with the bad guy going down hard. <br/><br/>I quickly explained the rules: Each turn you play a card or point to a scene and make up a story about what is happening. If no one challenges, the player gets the victory points from the card. To challenge, play a card and add to or alter the story. A dice roll determines who wins. If the challenger wins they get the fist player's card. If the challenged player wins they get both cards. After each turn players may move their character. Players may make anything happen but they may not kill another player's character till the last turn of the game. Pretty simple stuff.<br/><br/>We started the game with setting the scene. As host of the game I ran the bad guy. I made up how bad I was. I said the Rumpel had been stealing all the welfare and education money so everyone was poor, which I used to my advantage by recruiting kids into crime. The other players made up how I hurt them. The dwarfs told how I had really been recruiting dwarfs into crime and that I was a bad boss. The police said I was interfering with their crime ring and Jack told how he used my less that nice employees in unspeakable ways. I think they missed the mark a bit here. They set themselves up as rivals to me but also, as it turned out, with one another. The goal of the first turn is to set everyone up against the bad guy. That didn't fully happen which did hurt the game. <br/><br/>The host starts off the first turn. I played a card and told about beating a waiter who brought me the wrong drink - shame on me for being such a jerk. Bob showed his colors and challenged me but I won so it actually put me ahead. The other players were a bit confused about challenges. This story telling stuff is no their primary way of playing. <br/><br/>Bob went next and picked the first of four scenes. He has played Snapshot: 1969 (my game from last year) so he easily made a story, saying that Rumpel wanted to rob the casino. Sadly this didn't get followed up on because when Mark when he led the story into competitive moves against the other players, trying to control crime (and thus them). Dave followed this up by abusing a dwarf, so all the players were against one another. The scene cards did guide the game through something of a story but it was not the best. In the end though the players all said they had fun which seemed true. <br/><br/>Observations:<br/><br/>Bob did follow an aggressive strategy of challenging often. I was amazed that he did not always do challenges with low victory point cards (the most rational move). The strategy gave mixed results because at a 50/50 roll it was as likely to hurt as help. What won him the game was going after the scene cards which give progressively more victory points as they go. <br/><br/>No one had any negative comments on the card art. They quickly picked up to make gonzo moves, which make a crime revenge game fun (in my opinion). I believe the art helped point them towards and Smoking Aces vibe. The one thing they did say was that there were too many cards which is perfect since I'd already decided to break the game into two games of 54 cards each (rather than one of 90).<br/><br/>Though the players initially had a little trouble wrapping their heads around challenges no one had any difficulty making up stories. The card gave them enough cues that they rattled off stuff easily. This was a major positive since one of the hardest things to do with players new to story games is to get them to make up scenes. These gamers being board gamers that hurdle was going to be even higher. I had to give a little encouragement but did not have to fall back into story telling basics to get them playing. <br/><br/>The scene cards held the game together. Since the heroes fell into fighting one another more than going after me, a plot driven story would not have happened if it were not for the scene cards. <br/><br/>In the end Bob won - plugging my bad guy next to a mobile meth lab out in the desert ala Breaking Bad. Rumpel got what he deserved.<br/><br/>The end assessment of the players was that they were not as concerned about the victory points. They could see playing just to make a story. Since the game only lasted an hour we went on to play two more games (both of which I lost - good thing I don't care too much about that!)<br/><br/>Chris Engle<br/><br/>PS: I have a second play test set on order and will run it at a local con next week. This puppy is ready to pass off to the sales guy, which is good because my creative attention has shifted to the next game - Hungry Dragon.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407969/#Comment_407969" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T08:56:13+00:00" title="March  4, 2013  8:56AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Chris. Nice writeup!<br/><br/>I'm curious why you think the players "going after each other" was bad for the story. Given the way your game works (especially with everyone competing to win), I don't really see how that would influence the game to be better or worse. Did it have some undesirable effect on gameplay?<br/><br/>I would think have tension between all the characters would just add to the drama. Was that not the case?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407987/#Comment_407987" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T10:11:01+00:00" title="March  4, 2013 10:11AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't mind the conflict but the players said that one of their problems was not having a focus in the story. Their conflicts were kind of like a round robin - rock-paper-scissors - rather than focused - lets kill the rock! The scene cards plot is all about getting the bad guy so it didn't fit as well with what they were doing. <br/><br/>The funny thing is that the opening Bad Guy bragging about how bad they are and the players saying specifically how the baddie hurt them is suppose to give that focus of story. It just didn't this time. I may need to reword the rules to be a little more direct and explicit so people know it is to get them focus.<br/><br/>The victory point winning and losing part is really a meta-conflict. People can be very cooperative in the story and yet compete over who gets which victory points. That part worked fine. The scene cards provided the chance for a late change in who got the most points.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407989/#Comment_407989" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T10:15:28+00:00" title="March  4, 2013 10:15AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2013 10:17AM by Paul_T.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Without ever having played this game, the design suggests to me that, yes, it would be very easy to lose focus in the story. (I've designed a number of loose "story-telling" games like this, and it's always one of the problem points in design: players don't always naturally focus the story enough, so you need some push from the game's rules for that to happen.) I remember thinking that when I read about this game concept in the first place (and may have even posted to that effect in the thread, if I remember correctly).<br/><br/>In this case, if "taking down the bad guy" is the way you want the game to go, maybe you should make that explicit, up-front in the rules or text?<br/><br/>Anything between these two extremes could work:<br/><br/>1. "Say how the bad guy hurt you, and why you will spend every waking minute trying to get your revenge."<br/><br/>(Implicit in the game description.)<br/><br/>2. "Whichever player's character finally takes down the bad guy at the end and gets his right desserts gets +X Victory Points."<br/><br/>(Built into the design as a goal.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408003/#Comment_408003" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T11:27:48+00:00" title="March  4, 2013 11:27AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that "and spend every waking minute trying to get revenge" That's good - I'm stealing that!<br/><br/>They do get a lot of victory points because the last scene card is the "Get medieval on the bad guy" and give mega VP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
