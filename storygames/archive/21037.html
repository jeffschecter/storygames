I would not schedule anything less than 10 hours for a tabletop game, and with the overhead from online interactions that would grow a bit for a hangout/skype game.

I tried to run it on a forum, but I ran out of steam. As the GM you need to keep track of the current game state, and can of course keep notes outside of the game for this, but I just got bogged down in keeping track of everything. The dynamic is very much weighted towards the GM doing a lot of work, since the players mostly write two-word commands, but as long as you're prepared for that it should work. It was also hard to gauge the players' interest in the game, since they only write "GO WEST" and the like, which can of course be solved by a separate out-of-character thread. I just felt that the players' creative input was limited compared to the amount of work I was expected to do as GM. I've considered restarting the forum game, and not mention that they've waited years for the game to respond to the latest input, as I still like the idea of it.<br/><br/>I was introduced to chat-based B/X D&amp;D by people here on Story Games and I think it worked great. We had a shared Google sheet with PCs, and you need a way of rolling dice preferably in chat so that anyone can see the results. If you do low-level play, it mostly consists of the GM describing things and the players stating their actions or dialogue. Combat is usually short and deadly enough that you don't have long drawn out segments of dice rolling and rules lookup. I found the fact that you had to wait for the full description by the GM very evocative, as I had time to picture what was going on and formulate my response.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461605/#Comment_461605" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-03T14:45:02+00:00" title="April  3, 2017  2:45PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm.

Basically, players choose and then draw either red or white tokens 3 times per game (when playing in person); but, you can easily have players simultaneously type 'r' to choose a red token and 'w' to choose a white token, into the chat box.

It was more focused on principles that good play-by-post games and via-video played games should have, so I can't unfortunately share a list of suitable games.<br/> <br/>In the debate we identified conflicts as worst time-consuming and obstructing element of play-by-post game. Even in Fate, which is mechanically pretty simple, you need to confront the obstacle, wait until Storyteller sets difficulty (or rolls against you), then you can roll yourself\u2026 and then you can say what happened. Time-consuming. As a solution we agreed on reducing the need of exchange between player and Storyteller in conflict. It is a place where there is potential to speed thing up and make the play more fluent. Example for us was Apocalypse World where you always roll against set number \u2013 you don\xb4t need the Storyteller to set you difficulty. Second thing was interpretation of result. In a lot of games, Storyteller does that\u2026 but waiting for him to show up (when you already know if you succeeded or not) just doesn't make sense. Solution could be to let players interpret their own successes and let them continue their story not to slow thing down. Storyteller steps in only when players fail to succeed, makes life more complicated for them a bit and then pass point again to them.<br/> <br/>Based on this discussion, we (my brother and me) made a play-by-post game in epistolary format inspired by Dracula, whose mechanics are something in between Apocalypse World basic mechanic and Lady Blackbird. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> It was based on aforementioned principles (\u201cset the difficulty yourselves\u201d and \u201cplay until you miss or you have no more good ideas\u201d). So far seems to be doing the job well enough.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461821/#Comment_461821" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-09T08:17:04+00:00" title="April  9, 2017  8:17AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2017 8:57AM by Rickard.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would add my own <a href="http://urverkspel.com/vara-spel/oevriga-projekt" rel="nofollow">Imagine</a> to the list, but only if you got a loose definition of the "RPG" label. It's a vignette game where you get invested in a story, together with others, while exploring fictive people's hopes and memories. Takes about an hour to play.<br/><br/>The game uses hand gestures, and you take turns adding sentences. The results looks like this strip below. Each panel is one sentence added by one participant.<br/><br/><a href="https://plus.google.com/116235159947041206206/posts/87gB9oSZhTH" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1K7kg2SY1XM/WOntRKM52dI/AAAAAAAAAto/KZ34_eFRhYEUoPo9aSJw1tCshWBhF9i1QCL0B/w1060-d-h1414-p/writingComics.jpg"/></a><br/><i><del>Writing</del> Making Comics</i> by Scott McCloud<br/><br/>[edit]\xa0Cheers, Sandra!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461823/#Comment_461823" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-09T08:35:39+00:00" title="April  9, 2017  8:35AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2017 9:10AM by 2097.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's <cite>Making Comics</cite>, one of my favorite books<br/><br/>Edit: np\u2665                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachlan" title="lachlan"><img alt="lachlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachlan">lachlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461827/#Comment_461827" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-09T13:00:11+00:00" title="April  9, 2017  1:00PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had some success with Lady Blackbird (AAR <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/10558/lady-blackbird-by-post-in-the-belly-of-the-beast#latest" rel="nofollow">here</a>)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
