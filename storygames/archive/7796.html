I'm tentatively planning on using the pregen characters from the demo promo that used to be on Timfire's website (sadly no longer there).  However, depending on time, I might take a crack at throwing in some original abilities as well.<br/><br/>Note:  I've read through most (I think) of the Game Advice and Actual Play here and on rpg.net, so its not necessary to repost those.

No idea what was inside - I Mountain Witch tricked the hell out of it to excellent effect.<br/><br/>Another solid one I stole from someone off the internet is a pear tree.  Ask the players what happens when they eat the pears; it's really that simple.  <br/><br/>Lastly, the characters come across an archway on the hillside.  Adjacent to archway is a line of gray ash extending as far as the eye can see on both sides (like a wall).  The ash was said to form a wall in that anyone who crosses or who goes through the archway without first giving up that which they cherish most - would suffer greatly.  There was a basin near the archway to offer up what you cherished most.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172914/#Comment_172914" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T12:58:14+00:00" title="October  3, 2008 12:58PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One technique I've used successfully in several games is to have the Witch or a minion make reference to all of the characters in the group...save one. When used at the right time, it can really sow the seeds of discord within the group.<br/><br/>In the WW2 Nazi castle game, it was dogtag numbers written on a chalkboard in the radio room. In the Apocalypse Now game, it was a Vietnamese woman calling out their nicknames over a hidden loudspeaker in the jungle. But you could just as easily use names carved into headstones in a graveyard or beautifully done ink drawings on rice paper.  <br/><br/>Remember that when you are running this game as a con scenario, you need to skip to the awesome. I typically don't even use chapters.  When your trust is gone it is GONE.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/morgue" title="morgue"><img alt="morgue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/morgue">morgue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173108/#Comment_173108" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T22:47:02+00:00" title="October  3, 2008 10:47PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From one game I ran:<br/>(AP over on the Forge <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20778" rel="nofollow">here</a>)<br/><br/>These aren't bangs, they're encounters, but they set up play into which you can throw some good bangs.<br/><br/>First encounter:<br/>The ronin encounter a wolfpack.  The pack leader can speak, and orders the ronin to turn back, for the way is closed to them. The wolf's first words are 'which of you is the leader of your band?' to force some kind of response to that issue.<br/><br/>Second encounter (from an AP by Ron Edwards):<br/>Some tengu stalk the ronin\u2019s camp at night, and since the ronin all look alike to them, they ask the sentry if he or she is the one who "made the deal."  Another ronin hears this exchange.<br/><br/>Third encounter:<br/>The ronin are lost in a maze of tangled roots and dark trees.  A forest sprite offers to lead the Ronin to the mountain path, but only if he is given a token of the most personal significance by each ronin.<br/><br/>Fourth encounter:<br/>Blind Man\u2019s Cottage: The blind man lives alone in a small cottage.  He will invite the ronin to take tea with him and spend the night under his roof.  He tells them the Witch can corrupt the weak, and any who are too weak will inevitably betray their fellows. But at night his head detaches and flies off to feed on human flesh!<br/><br/>Those were the only planned encounters I used - as you can see in the AP, past this point the players were driving everything. Below is cut'n'pasted from my wrap-up post:<br/><br/>"My experience was this:<br/>* importance of GM prep and guidance in Act 1: high<br/>* importance of the above in Act 2: fair<br/>* importance of the above in Act 3 and 4: low to nil<br/><br/>The only other advice I have for GMs in the endgame is to keep clearing space around the characters for them to resolve their own conflicts.  I could have kept throwing bad guys at the ronin all day but the clear focus of interest for everyone was the ronin's relationships.  Adversity in the very final stages should be applied carefully, so as not to upstage the interactions between the ronin."<br/><br/>Hope that's of use!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173297/#Comment_173297" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-05T00:05:14+00:00" title="October  5, 2008 12:05AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have six pages of Mountain Witch notes and ideas culled from various threads over the years; too large (and loosely attributed) to post but I'm happy to email a copy to anyone who wants one.
