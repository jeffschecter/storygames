I mean it. Fuck what anyone else says. Andy's point is a good one.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo: As emphatically and clearly as I can state this: fuck no. Generic systems are terrible and useless. I am a huge advocate for, say AW, but the lack of a solid setting or situation [despite its excellent procedures] is a major stumbling block. I get the why and the how of it, but I think more should and could have been done to hone it down. Systems should be intimately tied to the fiction. I my own design endeavors, I think this was my biggest mistake. Nail down the genre, tone, situation, setting, colour, story, &amp;c.; Games should strive to be as specific to either genre or situation as possible, be they Lady Blackbird, Ribbon Drive or Mist-Robed Gate. Really, less is more in gaming. Not having to hack or deal with setting, names, new classes, mechanical tweaks to fit genre conventions, &amp;c;, means I can focus on playing my character(s).<br/>\n<br/>\nInevitably, you can't do everything as a designer. People will drift, hack, off the rails, improvise and whatever. And there'll be gaps in the design. Always.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, sincerely, do as much of the work as possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374265/#Comment_374265" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-24T22:43:27+00:00" title="April 24, 2012 10:43PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All your game are generics because I will haxxor them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374266/#Comment_374266" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-24T22:48:09+00:00" title="April 24, 2012 10:48PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is Fiasco generic?

GURPS, meanwhile, doesn't work for many people because it does very little to direct you towards a creative payoff; sure, it argues for the fun of the traditional adventure in the GM's world, but presumably the veteran roleplayer has already seen and done that, so it's not even a hook from his viewpoint. Of course some people still bite on GURPS, but I think it's fair to say that it's not the expected reaction to a game that is only about regulations for measuring a player character's punching power with or without power gloves.<br><br>So, creative hooking. Failing that, as many have remarked, there surely is plenty of room for a generic system out there, even if it's just as something to fill the shelves. This is not as insignificant as one might think, as a well-made generic system could still act as the backbone of an otherwise compelling game. For example, <a href="http://solarwiki.janus-design.it" rel="nofollow">Solar System</a> - it's a generic system, and I don't think that it's particularly compelling by itself. Sure, Solar System is <i>good</i> and <i>well-made</i>, but those are not the same as creatively compelling.

And of course, people sold on it in that context are also willing to fiddle with it independently, outside the TSoY context.<br><br/>I don't think that writing up a setting is necessary for a game to have creative impetus, though. <i>Apocalypse World</i> is a good example: it has even less setting than the already vague TSoY, but it all hangs very well together because the game has that clear creative imprimatur: go thence and barf forth apocalyptica, the game tells you, and it provides plenty of shards and puzzle pieces to put into your personal vision of what the post-apocalyptic rock'n'roll setting hinted at by the game might look like. That's creative hooking: if you care for the genre and aesthetics presented, you'll be motivated to master the game and play it well.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374281/#Comment_374281" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T02:11:23+00:00" title="April 25, 2012  2:11AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2012 2:13AM by Hans_c-o.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, "generic" is at least partially about marketing.

I've never bothered to read through all of the setting of The Shadow of Yesterday because I just didn't find it that compelling. (Sorry, Clinton. I really should read it!) But the concepts of Keys and Secrets? That was compelling, that was what got us to grab the system and immediately use it for settings and situations that we found more compelling.<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard is another good example of this. How many people say "I don't wanna play a game about some Mormons in the Old West"? And how many of those people are happy if you just re-skin it to Jedi? Or to a Viking-era Scandinavian setting, as our group did? And we did it with that specific system because we saw that it offered tools to provide particular game experiences.<br/><br/>At the other end of this, Talislanta has an extremely minimal / simple game system, which in that sense makes it "generic", but it's the setting that's compelling. If you know and like Talislanta already, you might say "hey I can use this system to run games in other settings". But if you don't know or don't like Talislanta-the-setting, you're not likely to say "but this would be a great system to do [x]", because there's nothing particular about the system to get a specific experience with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374284/#Comment_374284" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T03:04:02+00:00" title="April 25, 2012  3:04AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: philaros</cite>But the concepts of Keys and Secrets?

My own experience has been that although I'm a huge Solar System geek, it's because I got into the system first for other reasons, and only grew to appreciate it via play. I imagine that many people have had similar experiences with e.g. GURPS. The point stands, though, regardless of the example - the worth of the game is in being compelling, not in being specific. If you can create a generic system, like say Solar System, and people find it compelling because it offers them something exciting, then that's a worthy game.<br/><br/>Also, Philip - come visit us here in Finland, and we'll play some TSoY. I think you'll find that the setting is very compelling indeed. (This is no extraordinary claim, I can totally believe that an e.g. Talislanta expert would be able to showcase the best parts of the setting to me just as easily.)<br/><br/>Most roleplaying games will find their creative compel in something powerful they have to say about human-condition-something-or-other. I've been reading Hero System lately, and I'd say that it's at its most compelling in the part where it outlines the mechanical differences between lethal and ordinary damage in an elegant, exact and unforgiving manner. There are many things that can make your game compelling, and not all of them are setting-specific.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374304/#Comment_374304" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T07:15:51+00:00" title="April 25, 2012  7:15AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would play a game that doesn't have a specific setting but whose rules:<br/><br/>- do something significantly new<br/>- emulate a specific theme or genre<br/>- solve a problem I have with gaming that no other game does<br/>- are like an existing game I love but faster and with less work                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374314/#Comment_374314" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T08:31:38+00:00" title="April 25, 2012  8:31AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jon Shepherd</cite>.<br/><br/>Ever seen<a href="http://www.homebrew.net/games/" rel="nofollow">this list</a>? It's chock full of simple, functional, and utterly useless systems.</blockquote>\nWhat is "Sorcerer" doing in that list? Sorcerer isn't free....<br/><br/>But this remind me that Sorcerer is a good example about how little "generic" is a game whose brand of "generic" is tied only to setting agnosticism and pre-setted themes...<br/><br/>For most of their history,  role-playing games had systems that were little more that D&amp;D hacks (and I am not talking only about Rolemaster, I am talking about GURPS, Vampire, Amber, etc too: just look at the amount of space is devoted to combat and the unchanging role and authority of the GM), so "different games" come to mean only "different setting or character type" and "different house rules used in this hack of D&amp;D", with this second difference cosmetic or very minor in rapport to the first.<br/><br/>So, this is how the false equation "no specific setting" = "generic" was born.<br/><br/>There are a lot of (forge) games that have no specific setting, but they are anything but "generic": Sorcerer, Primetime Adventures, My Life With Master (has a typical example setting but the rules make it clear that can be played anywhere), Annalise, Fiasco, Shock:, etc.<br/><br/>Some of them have specific themes (My life with master for example) but not everyone do. Primetime Adventures doesn't have a specific theme or setting, it has a specific (and peculiar) system and a specific kind of Characters (not tied to a setting).  Others have a specific kind of situation but not setting or theme (Sorcerer, Annalise), others have a specific kind of very peculiar system (The Pool)<br/><br/>None of them is "generic" or "universal" if not in the sense of "this book doesn't describe a specific setting" (and in this case it should be called "setting agnostic" o "with no fixed setting", not "generic".<br/><br/>To be REALLY generic, a game should have no specific setting, no specific situation, no specific characters type, no specific color and... no kind of specific system peculiarity!<br/><br/>Do they exist? I think so: Fudge, D20, Basic RP, GURPS, Hero System all have specific systems, that don't make them 100% interchangeable, so they are not 100% "generic", but they have enough similarities with each other (and with hundreds of other systems) that I think they can be called "generic" with little error. But not "generic" as in "universal" (no game is universal, GURPS less than most), but "generic" as in "bland"<br/><br/>It's no surprise that the most played of them have a rich market of "spices" (setting modules, rules add-on, etc.) to give them flavor. They are the rpg equivalent of boiled raw spaghetti. If you don't add salt and tomato sauce (or something better than tomato sauce) they have really no taste.<br/><br/>So, there is room for other generic system? Well, the hard disks are big these days, a little file don't take up much space, there is room. There is need? I don't think so.<br/><br/>There is need for games with no fixed setting and/or themes? Absolutely.

I listed d20 but not d&amp;d because d&amp;d is not made up only by the system: D&amp;D is not "generic" at all in the color and the character types, for example.<br/><br/>And it's true that I am using "generic" differently from common rpg usage, but I am not creating another rpg-specific definition: I am using the common language meaning of "generic" noticing how silly and outdated is the rpg usage in that contest. (I mean...  Sorcerer a generic game? Or Shock:?)\n<blockquote> But I think "system peculiarity" is still a bridge too far.  To say (for example) that Primetime Adventures is not generic is beyond ludicrous.  It certainly is.</blockquote>\nI agree that is not a very satisfying wording: how we can define "peculiarity"? At the end I used that word because I didn't want to risk flames more than I already did, but to be honest, I was thinking more along something like "different from D&amp;D"<br/><br/>What I mean is that, if every single game was different from another, no game would be "generic".  What can make game system "generic" in common language is the way they are very, very similar to hundreds of other already published games. "generic", as in "I already have seen this everywhere for years"<br/><br/>So, for me PTA is not generic because it offer a gaming experience not similar to the one D&amp;D offer: it's not the usual "a penny for a dozen" common D&amp;D clone, but it's a very specific game with very specific effects.<br/><br/>And the way it can be applied to any setting is misleading about the specific need of PTA: .try to use it to play Conan, for example. Or The Man with No Name from Clint Eastwood movies. Or even a simple D&amp;D dungeon delving...  PTA require characters with (1) personal issues (at least one), (2) relationships with PNG, and (3) character arcs in a multi-protagonists story.  You can't use PTA to play a hardened and immutable tough guy (well, you can, but after the end of character creation, you have a tough guy with abandonment issues that at the end of his character arc maybe will retire to a nice place raising puppies... non exactly what you started with...)<br/><br/>PTA can be seen as "generic" only in the (absurd) rpg meaning: "the game manual doesn't contain a fixed setting"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374336/#Comment_374336" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T11:35:45+00:00" title="April 25, 2012 11:35AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would have said no when I started playing PTA. "Here it is," I thought. "The narrative generic system for all time!"<br/><br/>And then Spirit of the Century came out, then Heroquest, and then Fiasco, and then Smallville.<br/><br/>There's always room for new takes on generic systems. Though I don't think any of those games intended to be generic (although the core rules of Fate were certainly heading that way, and Heroquest 2 was made explicitly generic). For the record, I don't consider SotC generic, but gleaning the rules from SotC and Dresden makes it easy to play Fate generically (and Fate Core is on the way to make it explicit).<br/><br/>The idea that generic games have to be designed that way, or worse, have to have all flavor removed is ludicrous.  If we're sticking with the definition of generic systems as established by dinosaurs like GURPS and HERO, then it's a shitty definition. You're welcome to that definition. I have absolutely no interest in playing game systems that only serve as functions for determining random outcomes without no sway, style, or attitude.<br/><br/>There's definitely a line, but it's pretty fuzzy. I've used Nobilis to run an Avengers game. Is Nobilis generic? I don't think so. You have to do a lot of work to remove the nature of the characters from the context of being Powers. But all I have to do is make up new Oracles and In A Wicked Age can change setting and tone drastically.<br/><br/>Just because a game can't apply to every genre doesn't mean it's not generic, any more than saying GURPS doesn't qualify as generic because it can't be used to emulate a Coen Brothers movie or a TV show.  it's only generic if you're interested in playing traditional RPG styles. Fortunately for GURPS (and HERO) that style were the ONLY widely known way to play RPGs for the first 20 years of roleplaying.  <br/><br/>Now we have many, many, many new ways to play. Play focused on different themes or tone or styles.  As a result, our generic games are focused on themes or tones or styles. It's not possible to capture all of those. But when I go to the store and pick a generic brand soup, it's not just "soup." I still have to pick a flavor.  So yeah, we have a generic game that can run ANYthing as long as it's going to be played as if it were a TV show. We have a generic game that can run ANYthing, as long as it's got some pulp style (which luckily for us, 90% of geek favored genres of movies, books, and shows are descendants of pulp fiction).<br/><br/>And ultimately, your generic may differ from mine. I knew people who have used 2nd Ed AD&amp;D to run sci-fi (not Spelljammer) games. I'm baffled. I'd never do it. I don't get it, but maybe AD&amp;D was generic to them.<br/><br/>So to answer the OP question. Yes, absolutely. As long as we lack a perfect games, there are always ways to improve design and therefore there will always be room for more generic systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374355/#Comment_374355" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T13:34:08+00:00" title="April 25, 2012  1:34PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2012 1:35PM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think, after reading some of the comments, I misunderstood the question.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: Moreno R.&lt;/cite&gt;<br/>\nPTA can be seen as "generic" only in the (absurd) rpg meaning: "the game manual doesn't contain a fixed setting"&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf IAWA, PTA, Fiasco, &amp;c.; are for the purposes of this question 'generic' systems, then sure mang, design another.

And talent to boot. <br/><br/>Where, if you look at something like 3:16, it takes so much of that burden away from the players and the GM, so they can focus on, you know, playing and having fun. <br/><br/>My position on the whole matter, is that the less 'generic' a game, the better. That's just my bag right now. Basically, if I am paying for a game, I'm paying for the design team to do the work for me. Procedures, colour, art, Q&amp;A, the whole shebang. I'd rather have something I don't like that I can ignore or change, then just nothing at all. <br/><br/>So, then, bake in as much shit as possible. That's my solicited opinion on the matter of 'generics.' That is to say, don't.  Which was covered pretty well in the first couple of posts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374554/#Comment_374554" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T12:28:24+00:00" title="April 26, 2012 12:28PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>All your game are generics because I will haxxor them.</blockquote>\nnemomeme speaks truth.<br/><br/>Who needs generic games when you can hack a non-generic game into the form you need? <br/><br/>Formulated in a different way: Is it easier to turn a GURPS into Star Wars Jedi than it is to turn Lady Blackbird into Star Wars Jedi?<br/><br/>Formulated in yet a different way: What's the value of playing GURPS without hacking it for a setting?

Or even twisting it to secret plans or something.  There is a specific story structure which maps to approximately 20 minutes of the source material. Generally, when playing Star Wars or (insert your favorite setting here) I do not want to play a specific scenario, no matter how well it maps to the source.  I want to explore things unexamined by the source material. A generic system needs to give enough flexibility to create entirely new characters and situations, as JD says, so that all the players are able to capture what they want from the source and use that to create new stories and events.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374575/#Comment_374575" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T14:12:41+00:00" title="April 26, 2012  2:12PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If there's another The Pool out there somewhere in someone's desk drawer, I want to see it.

In fact, I suspect that you put "hacking it" in quotes because you knew you meant something different than I meant. So you're starting with a false premise to make your point--not cool.<br/><br/>Creating characters, situations, and ephemera are not hacking; that's playing. Creating system: that's hacking. <br/><br/>GURPS Star Wars Jedis (I wouldn't be surprised if this existed, at least as a homebrew thing on the web somewhere) isn't a set of characters, situations, and in-game actions. It's a set of rules to produce those things in a way that feels Star-Wars-y.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374609/#Comment_374609" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T16:38:00+00:00" title="April 26, 2012  4:38PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>If there's another The Pool out there somewhere in someone's desk drawer, I want to see it.
