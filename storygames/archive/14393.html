My version of it no longer even closely resembles that game anymore. I re-wrote stats and what they do, you now use pools of d6's that you wager or roll. It has aspects that are ranked like skills that you bring into your power checks. Turn order, initiative, and power activation has been replaced with an action point pool. Yeah, if I ever get around to cleaning it up a bit, it would make for a fairly awesome game on its own merit. <br/><br/>Oh, and for all challenges, other than BBEG stuff, players roll for narrative control, and based upon how badly the player fails also determines the amount of stress they take.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328085/#Comment_328085" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T16:59:26+00:00" title="June  6, 2011  4:59PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I completely relate to this urge.
