                    Heya,<br/><br/>When you have people playtesting your game for you (outside of your immediate presence) what are the five or six key things you want them to give you feedback on?  For instance, if you could ask them five or so questions about their playtest experience, what would they be?  Also, I'm really interested in hearing from people who have playtested games.  What have you typically given feedback on? Why?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                </div>

                            Lordy.  I want to know as much as possible about a lot of different stuff.  <br/><br/>One thing that is useful is a play narrative or actual play, because you can often tease out things that are misunderstood or omitted from context that won't be raised as issues by the participants.<br/><br/>I want to know what failed, what didn't work, what felt wrong, subjectively.<br/><br/>I want to know, conversely, what kicked ass and worked really well, *especially* if it is stuff that either isn't codified well or was forced into fun shape by the participants.<br/><br/>I want to know where they stopped and consulted the rules, and what rules they consulted.  <br/><br/>All of this recorded right away, so nothing is lost over time, ideally.<br/><br/>Playtesting is hard and often frustrating.  I've done a lot and providing the above feedback sometimes takes aggressive prodding from the beneficiary.  Typically there will be a list of questions about things that didn't work quite right, or were obviously broken, and some play narrative.                        </div>

                            I feel conflicted on how to answer this question, so here's two different and pretty exclusive answers:<br/><br/>a) I only ever want to know one thing: <strong>did the game do what it is supposed to do?</strong>  This changes game to game, of course.  In <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> the question was, "Did the game create strong characters in a fantastic environment?"  And, no joke, if the answer is "yes" then I'm happy.  If the answer is "no," then it's a matter of what went wrong, and that requires other questions.<br/><br/>b) I want to know <em>everything</em> about the freakin game.  If you can provide an audio recording and a brain tape that includes everything each player ever thought in the course of the game, I'd want more.  I want to know what happened, what characters were made, why the players made those characters, what they did, how the characters affected the situation and play, how the character generation worked, if it was flexible enough and structured enough and inspirational enough, if the system was clear, if it worked, if it made things interesting, if it got in the way.<br/><br/>Now, those are probably pretty much the same question approached from different ways.                        </div>

                            A good question ! I can answer this from two sides.<br/><br/><b>As a Designer</b><br/>I normally ask Yes/No questions when I try and get feedback - chances are you'll get more back. As a designer, I want:<br/>1. Honesty - the playtester must not feel like they can't say nasty things.<br/>2. Rulebook ease of use - was it easy to read before first play? Was it easy to refer to when you dipped into it during the session?<br/>3. Did the example adventure show off the game enough?<br/>4. How easy was it to sell to the players to start with. Was it easy to show the benefit of the game over others.<br/>5. Any improvements they might have for the system.<br/><br/><b>As a playtester</b><br/>The feedback I have given depended very much on the source of the game. If it was online, it would normally be an email conversation and perhaps a little more blunt. If it was a face-to-face meeting, then I might be more tactful. The feedback I usually give back is along the lines of:<br/><br/>1. <b>Preamble.</b> Given the descriptions of the game, was it easy to sell to my players? How did they take up the idea of playing the game? Were they very keen or just going along with it because we'd been asked to test it?<br/>2. <b>Setting.</b> Did it make sense, is there a better setting out there on similar lines we'd rather play? Was the setting well thought out? Were there any huge holes? Could the players suspend disbelief long enough to think it might be possible? Towards the end of the adventure, were they keenly following it or were they just taking the mick? How easy was it to imagine new/different adventures in this setting? Did the setting lend itself to many adventures or campaigns? Was there a wealth of equipment/spells/vehicles etc to keep my players interested over time?<br/>3. <b>Book.</b> Was the rulebook professionally presented? Was the language/grammar/spelling good? Were the graphics and images in the rulebook good? Did they match the setting?  Did it have an index? Did it have a glossary (if needed)? Were the rules laid out well enough to make it a readable book and a reference book at the same time? Did it have a nice cover and did the cover match the content of the book? Was the aim of the game explained? Were there any aids that might help the GM/DM/Ref entice the players into playing the game?<br/>4. <b>Mechanics.</b> Were the mechanics complete? Did the setting suggest anything that the mechanics didn't cover or explain? Did the aim of the mechanics get met: did it suit quick play or detailed play? Did the book explain what the aim was? Did the mechanics feel fresh and new or just a rehash?<br/>5. <b>First Adventure</b> Was the demo adventure well written? Did the first adventure fit the setting? At the end of the first adventure, did the players want to explore the setting more? Did the demo have any resources for the GM? Was the adventure original? Did it start in a Tavern?<br/><br/>We don't playtest anymore due to the sheer bulk of ridiculous Fantasy settings that crop up. We're back to playing Icar just once a week.                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/><br/>That's good stuff guys.  I'm begning to see some patterns here, and that's always helpful.  But for those of you who have playtested or gotten stuff playtested for you, which aspects of those games needed the most revision?  Which of the sub-systems, if you will, were the most troublesome during playtest?  I am looking for anecdotal evidence in this.  What you experienced specifically is something I am very interested in.  Basically, I'm asking for you to analyze your playtesting experience in this case.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

                            Troy,<br/>I can only give you specific feedback from my rather odd group of technical types with University (or higher) education. These points might not wash with the general base of roleplayers out there. We like free-and-fast rpgs where big combats can be completed in a few hours.<br/><br/><b>General Mechanics</b><br/>Any part of the mechanics that you use a lot such as feats/ability/skill resolution should be very easy to understand with examples. If the group can get their heads around that, then it's likely that the rest of the system will come together. If the game requires a lot of resolution of tasks then the system to do that must be easy to understand. Not neccessarily watertight. A good way to mitigate this (in part) is to have levels of mechanics - basic, intermediate and advanced. The GM can then build the rules up as sessions go on.<br/><br/>An unplaytested system will tend to suffer from not having rules for 'obvious' combinations of equipment/spells. For example, having a grappelling rope without any idea about how you might want to swing on it. Things like that. Also, combinations of equipment and spells can be devastating - difficult to tell at design time but easy during a playtest where the players are trying to wring the system for all they can. These always need revision - normally just in the wording.<br/><br/><b>Garbled Setting</b><br/>A background that tries to do too much and introduce too much in one go tends to be bad. The player won't know how they characters are to react if the setting isn't obvious to them. If the main thrust of the setting is obvious and then the details make it unique then it's a lot easier to get into. Less referring to the book. It also allows the GM to improvise consistently within the system. Of course, this is a balance issue. You need to make it well described without making it like every single other game out there.<br/><br/>A good example of this was when playing a Wild West Fantasy game. It wasn't obvious whether the Law in the town would come after the players if they shot someone. Seeing as they were playing gunslingers, this really should have been made obvious in the setting. This setting also had problems with many of the Spells being able to protect from bullets (or modify the weapons enough to make them not fire), which made the gunslingers next to useless. This is more of a mechanics point, though. The designer said that the group was meant to be mixed of magical types and gunslingers (making the balance) but I argued that if players want to play gunslingers across the board, they certainly will.<br/><br/>Another setting limited money to the players so that the objects they could buy and use were always kept at a low value. Unfortunately, the designer had seen fit to include a super-spy-metal-gear-solid pickpocket-type character that could steal nearly anything. The team became very rich this way, bought all they needed (rather than work through a series of adventures for it) and the game ended quite quickly.<br/><br/><i>Conclusions</i><br/>These are the two big things that I have fedback in the past. I don't think, as a designer, that you can entirely avoid these problems without playing the game a lot. You can set up 'use cases' for the game: making loads of characters yourself with different combinations and thinking what might happen if they met.<br/><br/>I hope that goes some way to answering your question!                        </div>

                            Rob, regarding your "Book" Feedback as a playtester, it makes me wonder. That's more of an issue with editors/finished book, I can't imagine too many people bother with professional editing/layout and art for the playtest versions, because they can change drastically.<br/><br/>I'm with Joshua, though I'll add something between A and B(3?), "Was it fun?

                            Thunder God, in the old days, I'd agree with you. However, I think that with more cyberpunk methods of getting rpgs out amongst the players, it is now possible to playtest at an early stage (without graphics and typesetting) and then at a late stage once the game is put together. At a late stage, you can then test how the game feels in its natural environment, surrounded by graphics, fonts and the like. As no hardcopy print needs to be performed at that stage, adjustments and alterations can be made without great cost or effort (especially in the case of accidentally overpowered weapons/spells). Furthermore, the digital publisher can release many revisions without angering the players too much - a there's not a paper book to rebuy, there's many more options.                        </div>
