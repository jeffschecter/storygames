As Go Play Northwest approached, it quickly became clear that the latest revision was not going to be released beforehand, so I decided to do <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9686" rel="nofollow">as I had done once before</a> and run it anyway. I <a href="http://www.goplaynw.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=235" rel="nofollow">scheduled it for Sunday</a> and got three slots filled quickly by Matthew Klein (moleculo), Ben Wray (Benhimself) and Peter Darley. I left one slot open for at-con signup; JB Bell grabbed it, and then Chris Bennett (Caesar_X) wriggled into a nonexistent fifth slot because damn it I can't refuse that man anything.<br/><br/>John knew about this plan, and announced that, rather than leak any notes or hints about how the new edition would work, he was going to watch the game, write down whatever we did, and publish <i>that.</i> I stuck to my guns. Surely, I thought, he'll mention some clue about how things will be different. Surely he'll offer a word or two, at game time at the very latest, as to what the hell I should be doing.<br/><br/>Never play chicken with John Harper.<br/><br/>Fortunately, I have a friend in Matthew Gagan (nemomeme), who is much better at prepping, running, and paying attention to what the hell is going on with Danger Patrol than me. At around midnight, as Saturday was becoming Sunday and my flop-sweat was starting to fly off in cartoon droplets, he kindly shared with me his own hacks and house rules, his gorgeous laminated sky-ship poster, a number of clues he'd put together about Gamma and <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=322330" rel="nofollow">this</a>:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>shhhhhh. don't tell anyone.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.dangerpatrol.com/dp_cards_sample.jpg"/><br/><br/>TOP SECRET <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nSo I had two cards and a couple rumors with which to put together a game. Okay. I sat down at 8:30 am at a corner table, got out some index cards and a notebook, and tried to invent Danger Patrol Gamma before lunch.  I was more fortunate yet to have Ben and Johnstone Metzger (Johnstone) stop by and supply plenty more traits and tags as my feeble brain ran down.<br/><br/>The gist of what we came up with is this: as John says in the thread linked above, all the dice are d6s now, and you tag things in from a single category, a la Lady Blackbird. Instead of pool dice, however, you can add in danger dice; regular dice give danger on a 1, danger dice on a 1-3. We kept the danger die limit at 5, although the distinctions about who could contribute which die got hazy pretty fast. The four trait categories (Action, Battle, Investigation and Science) are in theory used for different goals--doing stunts, attacking Threats, solving Questions and researching technology, respectively. That got hazy too, as people often used Action rolls to attack foes and Science rolls to move questions closer to completion, but who cares.<br/><br/>On the example cards, the Style gives you four traits in one category and two in the rest, and the Role gives you six/three/two/one. I kept that split for the other cards and (replicating the Beta roles and styles) gave them a mostly even distribution among primary categories, though I think there was one extra Style in Action instead of Investigation. I've got most of the cards in my folder at home; I'll try and type them up later.<br/><br/>Matthew had mentioned that there was no longer a distinct split between Action and Investigation scenes, so that the Investigation-focused characters didn't have to wait around to do what they did best. I had no idea how that would work mechanically, so I tried to set it up this way: when facing a big threat, the Patrol could radio their investigating or researching chums for help. We'd then cut over to said chums, already in mid-infiltration or striving to control a dangerous reaction, and play out their attempt to solve the targeted questions. Once they did, we'd have them radio back the monster's secret weakness or the code to defuse the bomb, and cut back to the action scene, where the answer would provide three bonus dice for the next roll. I think it's a solid idea, but in practice it didn't work quite as I intended.<br/><br/>Other hacks we frantically invented: since I didn't know what was replacing the danger tokens and their associated powers, Matthew K suggested that passing a "power" marker on the danger scale would simply give you a bonus die for your next roll. (We did use the beta danger scale, which I printed on separate cards.) Matthew G said that he counts the hits scored during an investigation scene and uses it to determine the GM's "danger budget" for threats during the next battle scene; I tried that, and also extended it by occasionally not using a GM move and instead" banking" that danger for the final scene. In addition, I declared that we wouldn't be able to trigger that final confrontation until EVERY player at the table had reached the middle section of their danger scale! This led to pretty much <i>every roll</i> including the maximum of five danger dice, which is awesome. I had originally intended to make the Big Bad invulnerable until somebody had actually maxed out their danger meter--I really wanted to vaporize the little bastards!--but under the pressure of the con time slot I ended up abandoning that.<br/><br/>Next, the actual damn game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333915/#Comment_333915" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-11T16:29:33+00:00" title="July 11, 2011  4:29PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Previously, on Danger Patrol!<br/><br/>Robot Professor <b>INDOC-1337</b> (JB) was helpless, secured to a glowing furnace-engine by the insectoid Queen Xandra, who hissed that now, HE would be the one who fueled her sky-ship with his power core!<br/><br/>Ghost Detective <b>Drake Deadman</b> (Ben) narrowed his eyes at his crime scene analysis: finally, a clue about the weapon that had killed him!<br/><br/>Ten-year-old Atomic Warrior <b>Indiglow Girl</b> (Matt) frantically steered a jet-bus full of schoolchildren away from a volcano, shouting "it's... slipping...!"<br/><br/>Lizardlike Alien Daredevil <b>Rek Stalek</b> (Peter) returned from a refugee camp in the nuclear wastes of Earth, where he had been performing as a dragon to give some solace to a young friend of his!<br/><br/>And Ambiguously Gendered Mystic Explorer <b>Quan-Li</b> (Chris) fled down a cavern from a pair of insectile guards, clutching his prize: the Eyes of Zalazim!<br/><br/>It looked like things had gone poorly for our heroes; we opened with Quan-Li and Indiglow Girl lashed to the sails of the aforementioned Queen Xandra's skyship, while poor Indoc was still chained below to the increasingly hot engine. As soon as the Queen left him to go up top and gloat, however, he used his Energy Transfer and Electro-Net Interface to redirect the engine's heat output to his own chains! Soon he was able to snap free, and calling Rek Stalek on the radio for answers about how to sabotage it properly (Threat 6). Rek--more a man of action than science--immediately declared that the solution was simple: "cut the red wire!" Too bad the 1337 model is colorblind... (I think this was the only successful cut-between-investigation-and-action bonus die move we did, but it was pretty great.)<br/><br/>As the Queen emerged on deck--still angry that Quan-Li had stolen two of her eight eyes (!)--Indiglow Girl used the beams of her Z-Ray vision to melt her bonds, while Quan-Li used a razor hidden in her sandal to slice the rope wrapped around his neck. The Danger on that roll got him a reduced hit (cue the inevitable "now that's a close shave!") but they both got free, with Quan-Li attacking the Queen's Bodyguards (Threat 3 x 2) and Indiglow Girl facing down the laser-axe-armed Executioner (Threat 5).  Meanwhile, Drake Deadman (who was not originally present, but whose Ghost power allowed him to act in all scenes simultaneously) appeared in a hissing white mist and damaged the ship's steering, putting off their arrival at the Gravity Pits ("where the gravity is six times that of the surface of the Sun!") (Threat 4, Countdown 3).<br/><br/>Also, for some reason, there were plasma bats.<br/><br/>The battle raged on until Indoc, acting on Rek's advice, succeeded in triggering a big whomp of Danger while messing around with the engine. It shook free of its moorings to the ship and punched straight out through the prow, pinning Indiglow Girl (who had just defeated the Executioner) smack to the front of it and dragging Indoc behind it. As it corkscrewed off into the atmosphere and the ship began to fall toward the Pits, Rek succeeded in activating something at the lab with a tarp over it and a note saying "do not use this, Rek." It turned out to be an experimental (I swear Peter and I yelled that word at exactly the same time) matter transference device that opened a wormhole close to the ship. Drake grabbed Quan-Li, Indiglow Girl grabbed Indoc, and they fell through the wormhole into Danger HQ just before it snapped shut. The Queen flew off, shrieking with rage, and the Danger Patrol had triumphed again.<br/><br/>(More later--feel free to jump in if you want, players...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333919/#Comment_333919" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-11T17:24:43+00:00" title="July 11, 2011  5:24PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Too cool!

Yeah! I mean, there were times I felt a bit constrained, especially working in one of those areas where style and role combined only gave me 4 tags to work with, and one or two of them were fairly specific, but there were just as many times when I was like "Hmmm, I have the 'commune with the beyond' tag: Yeah, I'm totally traveling to the afterlife to talk to the people Yoyodyne has murdered to keep its secrets!"<br/><br/>2. I think it was just about right. There was a steady increase of danger, but we succeeded at <i>most</i> of what we tried. That's about my sweet spot, as a player, especially for that genre of game.<br/><br/>3. Hmmm. Brendan basically did it as one of his many possible danger moves, like the original version: I believe stunned made you lose your next action, injured increased the target number of future rolls, and nobody actually got K.O.'d or vaporized but the results of that seem pretty obvious to me. I've never been a fan of "lose your next action" type defeats, but it all worked out well enough in play so it wasn't that bad (also, a stunned player can still contribute danger, so they're not as "out of the game" as they might be in some other system)<br/><br/>4. Figuring out what to do when we hit the spots that used to be worth a power token. (We just gave people +1 forward for it, which worked well enough.) Also, Brendan had originally decided that we wouldn't be able to attack the end boss until someone was at max danger, but it became kind of obvious nobody would hit that by the end of the slot, so we handwaved that away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334726/#Comment_334726" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-15T18:37:11+00:00" title="July 15, 2011  6:37PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like a great game, Brendan!

For your help (which really cannot be overstated), the kind words and the credit to Nate.<br/><br/>Ben covered most of John's questions, but I wanted to speak a bit more to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.  I didn't get a chance to write up the next part of the game, which was one Interlude (I don't remember now who was involved) followed by a three-part simultaneous Investigation. Indiglow Girl and Drake Deadman went to further ferret out the secrets of Yoyodyne's weapons program, INDOC and Rek went after a mysterious "Dr. Wayne" who could possibly answer why there were so damn many plasma bats around all of a sudden, and Quan-Li went deep into an otherplanetary jungle to retrieve a mysterious flower that he needed to analyze the Eyes.<br/><br/>I made a couple mistakes when setting this up. I wanted the investigations to take several actions to resolve, so I gave them multiple "hits..." AND gave them high target numbers (5, 7 and 8, I think). I really should have just done the latter and then used the Danger generated to create follow-up questions. As it was, the scenes were really cool and segued very nicely into the final action scene, but they took way too much time for the slot. The Patrol had to make multiple attempts to even get to 7 or 8 successes, even with the one-bonus-die-per-failure rule John suggested, which suggests that 3-6 is a very solid range for tricky but doable threats.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
