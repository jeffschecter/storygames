Even those who "knew nothing" of haiku.<br/><br/>Some lessons learned:<br/>-For a tight time slot, pre-gens would be a great idea.  Both tables played for two hours, and only got through one Season (meaning everyone only got one actual turn to instigate an action.)<br/>-It's a great idea for the Emperor (who acts as the judge for the haiku) to expressly state their stylistic preferences before a battle.<br/>-Punchy, short sentences in the battle sequence (the fight, not the haiku itself) are best.<br/>-No one really knows what to spend dice on before rolling.<br/><br/>Leading to these questions:<br/>- Can anyone tell me what the difference is between establishing something in the fiction through battle narration, or through dice expenditure at the end of the battle?  It seems like one could just as easily narrate "I shatter your sword with my iron fist technique" instead of paying for that fact at the end of the fight.<br/>It might be that the dice spent establish "conditions" on the final narration of the outcome of the duel (which comes after the dice roll).  So I might spend a die to say "And the people around this temple see this as a curse and refuse to live here for generations" so that no matter who narrates they must include that?  Is that the intent?  I'm not sure.<br/>Either way, no one seemed motivated enough to use this option.<br/><br/>- Two on one Duels.  Some clarity would be helpful here.  So I get that multiple people can be on one side.  And I get that they get dice in the end.  Also, they all three participants can write Haiku.  But the free narration part of the battle, how does that go?<br/>One game we just had the third participant sit out, only writing Haiku and rolling dice.<br/>One game we forced a turn structure.  So it went:\n<ul>\n<li>Attacker A<br/></li><li>Defender<br/></li><li>Attacker B<br/></li><li>Defender<br/></li><li>Attacker A... ... ...<br/></li></ul>\nIs that the prescribed behavior? I couldn't find a passage in the book that helped me make the call.<br/><br/>- Creating Threats.  So, we each write down four possible threats.  Then we have 16 threats, and need to narrow it down to 4.  Is that randomly determined?  Is there a vote? I find it difficult to come up with a "best practices" for this part.<br/><br/>Highlights:<br/>One Warrior Poet decided to answer a Threat by attempting genocide against a neighboring kingdom.  The battle to stop him was appropriately histrionic, involving using innocent children as shields.<br/>One Warrior Poet set his sights at winning the heart of another and bringing him to his bed-chambers.  He was defeated when his opponent elevated him to a position which requires chaste suppression of such carnal desires.<br/>One Warrior Poet set his sights at learning a Forbidden Technique practiced by <b>the Enemy threatening to assassinate the Emperor</b> and was unopposed.  Oh, how much drama that could have generated next season...<br/>All of the haiku generated were great, and often, it was really difficult picking the best submission, but the best moments of the game were when there was a clear winner amongst the lines, and everyone had to appreciate brevity and talent it represented.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gshowitt" title="gshowitt"><img alt="gshowitt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gshowitt">gshowitt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428390/#Comment_428390" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-18T14:32:11+00:00" title="February 18, 2014  2:32PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi! Author here, glad you enjoyed it. To answer your questions -<br/><br/>- There's little difference between establishing something during a battle and after it, but the dice spend mechanic is a way to say either "I just thought of this and I want it to happen" or "this is really important to me so I want to make it clear" or "I want the ramifications of this action to play out in a certain way." It's pretty loose, but it gives you a little directorial control. I've never seen it come down to a bidding war, but that option's there if the group isn't all on the level.<br/><br/>- For two on one duels, you got it right the second time. It's not very clear ("alternate between speakers on one side if it outnumbers the other" on p20), so I could do with making that easier to understand since it comes up so often.<br/><br/>- That's the idea, yeah; 16 threats, and the leader reads out each sentence, and each player puts their option forward, and then the leader says something like "So, does anyone like any of those?" and if someone's really keen for one, or there's a general consensus around one, select it. If not, throw it out to a vote. (If you do pre-gen characters for a game, pre-gen these as well to fit.)<br/><br/>Your highlights sound very cool. What vision of the Empire did you use?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428391/#Comment_428391" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-18T14:53:56+00:00" title="February 18, 2014  2:53PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, got it.
