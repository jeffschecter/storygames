                    Hey guys,<br/><br/>At the Forge, there's a post called <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20864.0" rel="nofollow">GenCon Observations from an "Outsider"</a>. While we engaged in Maoist self-reflection during Gen Con, the best way to make the Forge booth better next year is for us to get clear feedback from those who weren't financially invested/involved in it.<br/><br/>So, if you have something to add to that thread, positive or negative, please do! As long as it's constructive. We want the Forge booth to rock even harder next year!                </div>
