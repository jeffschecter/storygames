My friend Travis LOVED 3rd Edition D&amp;D.  I mean, this game excited him to no end.  It was perfect in his mind.  He offered to run the original Freeport Trilogy of adventures for me and few other friends.  We said sure.  We got through one and half adventures before it became clear that something was VERY VERY wrong.  We were totally lost.  We had no idea what we were supposed to do, where we were supposed to go, what we were looking for, nothing.<br/><br/>When it was clear that the group was frustrated beyond hope Travis asked me if we could trade roles.  He would take over my character and I would finish GMing as he felt that something about the modules "clashed with his style."  So I said sure and read through the trilogy of adventures.  I IMMEDIATELY discovered what had gone wrong.<br/><br/>You see The Freeport Modules use both dungeon crawl and clue-chain techniques.  There are certain places in the dungeons where the module explicitly instructs the GM to MAKE SURE the players discover certain pieces of information.  But my friend Travis had "corrected" the module.  He had assigned Spot/Search Check DCs and Listen Check DCs to all this stuff because "those are the rules."  We had failed several of these rolls.  The most outlandish of these was at the end of the very first module the NPC you fight is supposed to give a death bed speech basically setting up the context for the entire next adventure.  My friend Travis had assigned an Intimidate Check DC to this speech and we had failed this roll.<br/><br/>I went back to my friend Travis and pointed out in the text where the module instructs the GM to GUARANTEE that the players receive all this information and had received the honest and sincere reply of, "Yeah, but that's against the rules.  Why have rules for Spot, Search, Listen and Intimidate if you're just going to ignore them?"<br/><br/>Flip it around.<br/><br/>Some time later my friend Patrick offers to run a Forgotten Realms game.  My friend Travis is super, super excited by this offer as the new 3rd Edition Forgotten Realms book had just came out and he was dying to give the setting a whirl.  At one point we receive some kind of odd piece of currency I think it was.  My friend Travis starts flipping through his Forgotten Realms book very excitedly trying to find out what this thing was.  He starts reading aloud from various nearby nations "economy" sections and Patrick says, "Dude, you're not going to find in the book."  And Travis kind of blinks at him.  Patrick says, "it's something I added because it's the only way I could justify a slave nation and non-slave nation co-habitating."  Travis despondently flips to the last page of the book and says, "250 pages of setting information just wasn't enough for you?"<br/><br/>Sometime later we run into a scout of some kind who mentions that he's from Travis's character's home nation.  (Travis's character was wanted in his back story, if I recall correctly).  So Travis shouts out, "I attack him before he can say any more."  Patrick says, "You leap forward and cleave in his skull."  Travis again blinks at Patrick.  "Uh.... Initiative roll?"  Patrick, "You got the drop on an unsuspecting man."  Travis picks up his d20 and rolls it.  He says, "I rolled a 5.  You're telling me your leather clad scout has an AC of less than 5?"  Patrick replies, "What about you attacking an unsuspecting target do you not understand?"  Travis picks up his d8 and rolls it.  He says, "I did 3 points of damage.  Your scout has less than 3 hit points?  Even if he does he should only bleeding out at -1!"  Patrick says, "You brought a heavy iron sword down on the head of man not ready to defend himself. What did you think was going to happen?"  Travis, "An initiative roll."<br/><br/>True story.  I am not making this up.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149451/#Comment_149451" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T18:16:04+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  6:16PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apparently Travis missed the part in 3.0 talking about the places where you don't roll the dice, like opening doors or tying your shoes, right?

I put that there to show that Travis's commitment to the text extending well into the setting material as well.<br/><br/>The third example though is blatant GM over ridding the rules for "the experience."

The dungeon master HAS to follow the combat procedure every time, no matter the circumstances? It wasn't so in AD&amp;D.<br/><br/>Anyway, let's parse what happened. IF the GM changed a rule (or made an ad hoc interpretation of the rules for a specific case) he did it clearly and in front of everyone. No secret, no fudging. The players had the chance to contest his ruling (and Travis did), and at that time the GM decided (using his referee role, or "the buck stop here" If you prefer) to keep his ruling. No rule zero.<br/><br/>I think that here the GM did an error. He should have listened to Travis and let him roll his dice. Not because "it was more realistic" (it wasn't) or "because it's in the rules", but simply because his decision hurt Travis' enjoyment of the game, for no good reason apart from the old "The GM can't be contested" habit (but I can say that because I didn't play with Travis. From your description, maybe hurting his enjoyment of the game would have been reason enough for me...). What would have been hurt by letting Travis rolls his meaningless dice? <br/><br/>What would rule zero say in this case?<br/><br/>Well, Travis like to roll dice and follow rules-as-written. The GM like to thing about "what realistically would happen". Let's say that they are playing the Freeport trilogy. And Travis want to do all the rolls to discover things.  So the GM fudge. He make Travis "win" meaningless rolls, than give him the information in any case (but making him think that he "earned" them). He let Travis roll for initiative when when he think it's not right, but he fudge his roll to make Travis win it.<br/>Travis is very happy. He think he is a very good player. He find all the clues, solve all the mysteries. Patrick know the truth and his respect for Travis as a player, if possible, is lower with every fudged roll. He is playing not a referee, but Travis' ego-stroker (I described once, during a very heated discussion, the role that GM take when they do this to a player as a different kind of service to a different anatomic part. I still think that the paragon is apt, even if I try to not repeat it anymore on safe-for-work forums...). This situation can't last forever. Someday, Travis will discover the truth.  Or Patrick will lose his taste for GMing. In any case, the social consequences will be very much worse than if he didn't use secrecy and fudging.<br/>And it will be only at this time, after years, that Patrick will discover the real "value" of that rule the GM guide told him "as necessary to play".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149491/#Comment_149491" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T21:35:34+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  9:35PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, I couldn't have made up an example like that!<br/><br/>But what's the moral your adding, Jesse (if any)?<br/><br/>Is it that Travis got it wrong, not the texts?

I believe he would come from the experience as an altogether new man! D&amp;D is obviously grace to him, and I would love to disguise as the devil. I'd show him all the good things happening to you when you get so immersed in the character you never look back, and never think about how this or that rule applies to the characters life.<br/><br/>Of course: I would never dream of using D&amp;D to save him! Never ever! It would rather be a matter of saving him from D&amp;D, I believe. ;-)<br/><br/>On a serious note: why is the advice given in this game so dysfunctional? In my view the reason is the sheer amount of rules: they go beyond the critical mass and become a self-justifying universe. The intricacies of rules come to dominate the thinking on the game (if in doubt about this, read the thread: "[4E] Ok so it isn't perfect").

If you want to do gaming that is more towards improv than wargaming, that is cool but don't use words in all caps to talk condescending trash about rules heavy games.<br/><br/>They were just talking about this on 2d6 Feet in a Random Direction. They said Luke actually tells players to not use all of the rules "out of the box" so to speak. Use the stuff you like, run some simple encounters, feel out the mechanics and then slowly add things. I have to admit, Burning Wheel overwhelmed me on my first read through, but I was sold on the game when I did a Duel of Wits demo at Origins. Right there, Luke's advice in action. Just because there are rules for everything doesn't mean you have to do everything.<br/><br/>As for Travis, this is a great example of a complex player who loves the game for the game. I'm often called unkind names at family game nights because I enforce playing by the rules. If you aren't playing by the rules, why play? RPGs are a strange creature because breaking the rules doesn't mean breaking the game.

For any game out there, there are folks whose experiences with it were so personally unsatisfying that they develop a desire to "save" people from it. D&amp;D is certainly one of those. I get it.

Everything locks together with everything else.  It's like the D&amp;D rules are the "physics" of the game world--I think most of the earlier editions had this same mentality, but nowhere near to the same extent.  This <a href="http://www.thealexandrian.net/creations/misc/d&amp;d-calibrating.html" rel="nofollow">Calibrating Your Expectations</a> link is pure genius, and it really highlights how tight the skill system is.<br/><br/>In an earlier S-G thread, someone said D&amp;D 3e was like the rulebooks were an extra person at the table.  That's exactly right.  Not only do the D&amp;D rules describe the process of play, they also delineate the world in which play occurs.  Even the magic spells are rigorously defined and tightly interactive: there's a whole little technology there.<br/><br/>And it is <b>incredibly frustrating</b> when a module/adventure/whatever-you-call-it just says, "Eh, here's some bullshit magical effect I created in order to have the necessary plot effect."  Arrgh!  Learn the rules and use them!  If So-and-So the Horrible Villain is now a ghost as a result of a curse, it should be perfectly feasible for the Cleric to bust out a Remove Curse in the very first scene, fix the Horrible Villain, and everyone continues to explore the little setting, dealing with the ramifications. <br/>D&amp;D 3e's voluminous rules were sort of like a "physics sandbox," where if you wanted to putz around and achieve something, the rules were ready for you.  Taking that away by fiat, or because this plot requires it, seems really dippy and annoying.  If the rules say I can break your plot, get a new plot or use different rules.<br/><br/>(My two cents.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149679/#Comment_149679" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T11:28:35+00:00" title="June 11, 2008 11:28AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James_NoStack wins the gold star!<br/><br/>Callan was very observant in noting that I (largely) left my personal judgment out of this situation.  You see, Travis is not a dysfunctional person.  He showed up to play D&amp;D.  He was committed to D&amp;D.  He was excited about D&amp;D.  He wanted to engage his friends in a challenging game of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>And he was ROBBED of that experience.  Travis in my story is the VICTIM, not the subject of ridicule.  In the first example he was robbed by module designers who hand waved away the rules to try and deliver a kind of game D&amp;D is not good at delivering.  In the second he was robbed by a GM who was more concerned about a visceral "experience" than with the game at hand.  Notice that the GM GAVE Travis what he wanted, from a character and fictional perspective.  But Travis was upset because he was robbed of the GAME despite being handed what he wanted from a character oriented stand point.<br/><br/>I should point out that Patrick's game eventually disintegrated because like the Freeport modules we found ourself floundering as well.  When I later talked to Patrick about what went wrong I found that he was very confused as to why we had not uncovered certain plot threads.  When I asked how we were supposed to know those things he cited the "obvious" socio-political ramifications of certain pieces of *ARCHITECTURE*  No, I continue to not make this up.<br/><br/>Now I should point out that Patrick is not a dysfunctional person, either.  Travis and I have since drifted apart but I still see and occasionally play with Patrick.  I have since given him copies of The Riddle of Steel and Burning Empires both of which excite him greatly.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149693/#Comment_149693" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T11:55:32+00:00" title="June 11, 2008 11:55AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know what D&amp;D modules could use, to take care of this?

It was my little RPG guilty pleasure for 2 years, and it's <i>exhausting</i>.  I only completed 1 and it's not really very good.<br/><br/>"Okay: these are 3rd lvl characters.  They're kidnapped on a plateau by a city of ghouls.  They <i>could</i> cliff-dive into the lake below, but let me see how high the cliff would have to be... They're 3rd lvl, so their Jump skill isn't likely too high... and these are the rules for diving... into a pool of water.... hummm... no, the plateau is too tall.  I;ll make the plateau shorter.  Wait, now it's shorter than the tree tops of the lowland jungle: they could just climb on the branches and escape, which defeats the isolated, risky place.  Hmm, it would also screw with the visual of the plateau rising way up out of the canopy.  Hmm..."  And this can go back and forth.<br/><br/>Video game makers often tout that their environments are "fully-destructible," which is to say, they're 100% interactive.  D&amp;D 3e is <i>amazing</i> because it achieves the same effect - but it's a huge pain in the ass because it requires an extremely high effort.  And this in some ways is a problem, because the sheer obsessive detail of D&amp;D 3e kind encourages Secret Simulationists like me, and then the designers just can't deliver.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149701/#Comment_149701" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T12:16:08+00:00" title="June 11, 2008 12:16PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James,<br/><br/>Oh, absolutely.

I don't see how this somehow becomes an issue because between translation errors and inherant vagueness in the text theirs always to some degree diffrent rules between the players. Your left with some we'll you should tell your players and get their concent because we'll your a group and your not special so there and it would be nice nuahnuahnuah. But if you look at dnd in particular its great to say that the dm is not special and is just another kind of player, but lets face it unless the group goes to efforts to make the dm a player (things like divesting responcibility for plot, npc's , treasure, etc) the gm is a set of responcibilities and powers that other's don't want. I'm willing to bet that out of the group that travis originally put together, he choose jesse for a reason to approach about taking over the dming because it wasn't going well. I can't speak for travis but i know from my own experiance some players just aren't interested in these story mechanics/plotmechanics/rulemechanics thingies. The first time i was like , i don't know what did he say, to a pc (giving them a shot at narrative) they looked at me blankly.

The kind of game where the entire Space Station was one of the player's demons.  Indeed I had notes for a second storyline we never got to which featured a demonic Black Hole.<br/><br/>One the NPCs was a kind of space bandit who the owner of the space station gave sanction and sanctuary too.  Now we're playing along and all of a sudden Patrick starts having his character do really weird things.  His character is making deals with NPCs that make no sense.  He's asking questions that make no sense.  Finally, I just call a time out and say, "Hey Patrick, look, I have NO IDEA what you're doing.  Could you throw me a bone?"<br/><br/>Patrick looks at me quizzically and says, "Well, it's obvious the space bandit is planning on taking over the space station.  I'm making sure I"m well positioned when that happens."  I stare at him.  He stares at me.  He says, "The space bandit ISN'T planning on taking over the space station."  I look at him and say, "I wasn't planning on it, no.  What gave you that impression?"  He then begins listing off things in the game (similar to the socio-political architecture stuff from his own game) that he was sure were my intentional and obvious seeding of the idea of this impending coup.  I just shook my head and said, "Patrick, I'm not that subtle."<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149809/#Comment_149809" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T15:32:42+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  3:32PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2008 3:35PM by Graham.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love this thread.<br/><br/>James,\n<blockquote>Jesse: it doesn't have a rule for what kind of prostitute you encounter in a city at night.

So I can absolutely sympathize with Travis in the first case, but I have to say that although I strongly support text granting him the confidence to make the fixes he wants, if that's what he needs, but I think it's telling that he <i>didn't read the modules.</i> I mean, in what possible universe is that ever going to work out well no matter what the rules are?<br/><br/>I mean, if the module writer had written what Travis had wanted, and Travis had not had to change anything, the experience would still have been shitty, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149928/#Comment_149928" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T23:49:05+00:00" title="June 11, 2008 11:49PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max Higley</cite>Hey, anybody notice that, of the problematic decisions justified using rule zero here, none of them were made by consensus or even consent?

Certainly the second problem was about expectations of play style (gamist vs. narrativist in that particualr encounter), where Travis assumed that fights must always involve the combat rules (because they always had) and Patrick assumed they didn't always have to (even though they had so far). That is a clash of expectations more than anything else.<br/><br/>The first one too I think is similar, though the clash there was between Travis and the Module designer. If the module designer had said, upfront, that this module could only work if certain clues were removed from the rule/SIS structure and turned into explicit pointers to the next scenario, I suspect (without knowing him) that Travis would have accepted that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tablesaw" title="Tablesaw"><img alt="Tablesaw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tablesaw">Tablesaw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149948/#Comment_149948" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T03:39:36+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  3:39AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Sometime later we run into a scout of some kind who mentions that he's from Travis's character's home nation. (Travis's character was wanted in his back story, if I recall correctly). So Travis shouts out, "I attack him before he can say any more." Patrick says, "You leap forward and cleave in his skull." Travis again blinks at Patrick. "Uh.... Initiative roll?" Patrick, "You got the drop on an unsuspecting man." Travis picks up his d20 and rolls it. He says, "I rolled a 5. You're telling me your leather clad scout has an AC of less than 5?" Patrick replies, "What about you attacking an unsuspecting target do you not understand?" Travis picks up his d8 and rolls it. He says, "I did 3 points of damage. Your scout has less than 3 hit points? Even if he does he should only bleeding out at -1!"

Travis, "An initiative roll."</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Travis in my story is the VICTIM, not the subject of ridicule.

Maybe it's just the particular context of the story, maybe Travis would have had the same reaction for a simple skill check, but I just read such a poignancy in Travis's response. I mean, he wasn't just fighting for certain rules to be in place; those rules had a greater significance. Those rules say that everyone has, literally, a fighting chance.<br/><br/>Travis did eventually want the scout to die, but he also wanted to defeat him in combat. And the way you tell the story, it seems to me that meant something to him, if not his character (though I suspect it's probably the same). Perhaps it's the honor of giving one's opponent an opportunity to defend himself (even though that opportunity only exists in the system, not in the story). Or maybe, for Travis, the ability to kill another character is something that has to be earned. In any event, there's a risk to trying to kill someone, and that risk is important to the character's decisions.<br/><br/>Travis's character was a fighter, hardened by battle, willing to take risks, but always making sure the odds were as much in his favor as possible. He attacked knowing that his hand might slip, or the scout might notice his movement and dodge. He attacked knowing that the scout would probably survive the blow and could then respond in kind or possibly flee. Even though the odds were in his favor, things could go horribly wrong for him. But what Patrick did turned him into a cold-blooded murderer. By changing the rules, he also unfairly changed the morality of the story.<br/><br/>That's how it comes across to me, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149960/#Comment_149960" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T05:51:44+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  5:51AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>James_NoStack wins the gold star!<br/><br/>Callan was very observant in noting that I (largely) left my personal judgment out of this situation.

It sounds like Travis invested a shit-load of time to learn D&amp;D 3e <i>in large part because it presented a consistent rules-set to simulate the world</i>.

That Travis decide all by himself he didn't need consent, or that he was acting under suggestion he already had consent? Or something else?<br/>I'm suggesting several things for consideration:<br/>1) The way many rule zero texts are written, they are easy to interpret as putting sole responsibility (and thus power) for the decision with the GM.<br/>1.5) That this sometimes leads to misuse, and that such misuse is perhaps not as uncommon as some people here believe (at the very least, it exists.)<br/>2) In situations where the text is interpreted in this way, the GM very often makes decisions about how to run the game without consulting others and in a non-transparent fashion.<br/>3) <b>When decisions are made this way, with no input from the players, the lack of communication leads to a high frequency of expectation clashes.</b><br/>4) That it's easier to blame someone with a "faulty" concept of rule zero for having that idea than to ask how and where they got it.<br/>5) That there may be a direct causal link between "where you learn to play (i.e. the D&amp;D text vs. the DitV text)" and "how likely you are to use the idiot version of rule zero and claim that this is perfectly normal, so your players ought to sit down and shut up."<br/><br/>Now, I figure 3 is pretty obvious -- that, in and of itself, is a major building block of this indie community.  But 4 seems to be overriding it in these discussions so far, which pretty much precludes us getting to 5 as a serious topic of discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150005/#Comment_150005" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T08:09:18+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  8:09AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2008 8:09AM by Jeffrey Straszheim.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One reason to put rule-zero in the text is to ensure that the players understand that the book is not some inviolate canon, and they'd better check with the group, and in particular the GM, before they assume there will be no changes.<br/><br/>I wonder if something like this would have helped Travis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150007/#Comment_150007" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T08:14:47+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  8:14AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>I don't think there's any need to descend into personal attacks on a third party who's not present.</blockquote>\nFair enough, but if someone else drags Travis in as an example, we can't really help talking about him, can we?<br/><br/>The original poster could have changed names to protect the innocent.

So easy I have no doubt you can think of it yourself if you tried, but I'll go ahead.<br/><br/>Perhaps breaking out and playing a melee for Travis would be boring as hell for everyone else, including the GM.  Travis isn't the only one playing (roleplaying = social), and his fun isn't the only fun that counts.  It is possible that playing the game just the way our precious Travis would like would totally suck for everyone else.  In that case the GM is doing the best he can given the situation.<br/><br/>Or perhaps not.  It is also possible the GM just sucks and everyone else at the table wishes Travis would get his way.  Did they speak up and say so?  I wasn't there.<br/><br/>The original poster is acting like Travis was <i>owed</i> just the game he wanted by the group ("robbed", "victim").  This is balderdash.  If Travis has a strong preference for a game that diverges not at all from canon, it is up to him to find a group that wants to play that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe" title="Maddrjeffe"><img alt="Maddrjeffe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe">Maddrjeffe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150079/#Comment_150079" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T10:47:54+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 10:47AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I might have been a little ticked if I had sat at the table while he spent 20 minutes rolling to see if he can kill a level 2 commoner if it didn't seem meaningful to the groups story.

Its usually more like lets get to the good stuff and stop slowing things down. Ive seen games devolve into wrangling over mechanics and completely fall apart. Thats not bad all the time and it can lead to better play, but there is a balance between authority and mob rule by consensus and in my experience its rare for the pendulum to swing too far in either direction.

He knows what works and what doesnt through experience and trail and error.

Why is it that games just assume all that stuff instead of building it into the normal game procedure?  We know that roleplaying is a social activity...and we know that in social activities functional people have exactly those sorts of discussions all the time.  But we also know that RPGs are formatted like a game, and aside from a few common house rules (like whether you're going to win money on the Free Parking space in Monopoly*) you don't typically stop and have a dialog over what people want out of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it seems to me quite natural to expect that game texts highlight this explicitly in the rules, because its not something you expect to find in a game and its important enough to draw attention to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts one of the reasons I'm a big fan of Challenge Mechanics in games.  There are other, less confrontational, ways of accomplishing it, but Challenge Mechanics encorporate open dialog to resolve differences of opinion explicitly as part of the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Blood Red Sands for instance this entire issue would have been resolved pretty straight forwardly.  Travis would have stood up (BRS requires the ritual of standing in order to demonstrate that this is a big deal, not just chit chat) and said something to the effect of "Screw that, the rules say we roll initiative...we're rolling initiative" (BRS encourages being a bit in-your-face-aggressive cause that's the nature of play).  The other players would have either stood up with him if they agreed that rolling initiative was the right course of action, or remained seated if they don't want to go there.  Travis may or may not have gotten what he wanted, but it would be completely unambiguous what the opinion of the group was.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo given how much grief the hobby has experienced because of such lack of communication, its absurd that most games barely even mention the need for this in the text...and of those that do, few make specific actionable rules around it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n* Tangental Aside:  Monopoly is quite a fantastic game if not completely emasculated by the two most common house rules (so common many people think they're the real rules) of collecting money on Free Parking and skipping property auctions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150108/#Comment_150108" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T11:21:03+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 11:21AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Val,<br><br>Fair enough, but roleplaying game are <i>different</i> in a lot of ways from standard board games and such, so we shouldn't be too surprised if their social conventions just don't resemble Monopoly.<br><br>Some people actually like a playstyle where the rules take (more-or-less) a back seat, the the GM's spontaneity is critical.<br><br>I suspect you *hate* this style of play -- but whatever.<br><br>Rule-zero is a godsend for folks who play this way.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150114/#Comment_150114" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T11:25:59+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 11:25AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can imagine myself in Travis' position quite easily, and feel his distress.

By making such dialog an actual actional part of the game loads of this kind of stuff could be much more successfully and consistently dealt with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150126/#Comment_150126" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T11:32:14+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 11:32AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>I can imagine myself in Travis' position quite easily, and feel his distress.

I do think that if Travis was going to modify the module to add in the Spot checks, that he should have also changed the module to add more redundancy to find that information.

Different games have different scene framing procedures.  Consider for example the game Spione which has a phase of play called Maneuvers.  Everyone takes a turn during Maneuvers.  On your turn you can either a) add a detail to an existing scene or b) start a new scene around one of the Principle characters.  In Spione there are only every two Principle characters.<br/><br/>What this means is that if both Principles are in a scene and a player chooses option (b) above they have effectively chosen to end the current in progress scene.  Now Spione is very clear that it's meant to foster a dialogue so if anyone objects they should say so but it's ALSO very clear that such objections are ADVICE and FINAL authority lies with whoever's turn it is.<br/><br/>So yes, if the player was insistent that they wanted to end the current scene and start a new scene any objecting player would just have to accept that and move on with no right to complain because they agreed to *this* game and that's how *this* game's procedures work.  If they find this set of procedures consistently frustrating this obviously isn't the game for them.<br/><br/>Edited Note: I should point out that this is a totally separate issue from clash of creative aesthetic.  It might be the case that Player A simply doesn't creatively get along with Player B and vice versa.  Games with consistent procedures for creative input are more likely to expose these clashes for what they really are: one of aesthetic preferences, rather than say, confusion with the game itself.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150163/#Comment_150163" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T12:43:29+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 12:43PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Moreno, <br/><br/>Depends on the game.

The descriptions of that technique are really clear about the use of force (look for example at Ron's actual play of Carry, the one with that very aggressive framing on an "intimate" moment, and the discussion about it).<br/><br/>There are some other techniques that resemble it, but aren't the same.  In Spione the game system constrain narration rights and give conditions to the narration: you are not "framing a scene where the player characters will play", there are no player characters in the game, that is not "framing the play action", that IS the play action: narrate a scene.  <br/><br/>Another example of a different technique is in 1001 Nights: the GM can stop the narration at any time, but even this is not the transition from a framed scene to another: is a "stop the story now, I have enough gems"<br/><br/>In both these games, the star-stop of narration and the narration are "moves", as moving a piece of chess. They are not the means to create a imaginary space where others will play, done by a impartial referee.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150165/#Comment_150165" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T12:45:08+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 12:45PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse,<br/><br/>I think that a "clash of creative aesthetic" (for lack of a better description) is perhaps the core of the problem.

I've seen and been in games that were using system X (AD&amp;D 2e, d20, GURPS, whatever) which were little more than the GM's story hour with some die rolls. Everyone at the table was totally cool playing that way (including me, because it was fucking entertaining, save for the one DM who decided that it would be awesome if my female pirate was raped and mutilated because of a botched roll). When a new person comes to such a table, that person is the outsider. They're sitting down to play not so much Game X, but With Group Y.  If they dig the play style of Group Y, then it all works out. If they don't, then it crashes horribly, with the newbie as the problem one that will probably need to get up and beat it.<br/><br/>I think many of us have had that sort of experience (I used to see it all the time at GenCon AD&amp;D/RPGA games and the like, which my logic-brain kept breaking apart at. I suspect that this kind of thing hasn't happened too much in the years since d20 tho). A lot of folks become convinced that it isn't the new guy who is the problem (because their thought is to Play Game X, As Written!) but the rest of the group, who are just making shit up (and having fun) and not playing the game as-written.  In such an incommensurable situation, it's only natural for us to assign cause-and-effect, and instead of saying "well, that situation didn't work out", to rather analyze it and say, <br/><br/>"Yeah, but which one is <i>wrong</i>? The newbie who wants to play by the rules and is having issues with the group because they don't? Or the rest of the group who wants to play their style which pretty much ignores the rules? Cause one of them has to be right, and the other wrong."<br/><br/>Looking back, I think a lot of theory and all is basically chasing that tail of "which side is right/wrong", and a lot of the rest is built up on the back of that beast.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite><br/>And that's fine except that they aren't really playing the game at hand.  They're playing some other game of their own devising and I would feel cheated if I showed up to their game they claimed was X but "oh, yeah, well we just kind of ignore N, M and Q.</blockquote>\nYeah, this kinda backs up what I'm seeing above.<br/><br/>The new guy may feel cheated (even if he's not being a dick/griefer!) just because he's interested in the rules of the game (like the complexities of fighting, or the rules focusing on scene-setting or narrativist ennui rolls or whatever); but the rest of the group feels cheated because they invited him to play with them and he's not letting go of his quirky rules-focus in order to enjoy the social time with the rest of them.<br/><br/>But which side is wrong?  WHICH SIDE IS WRONG??<br/><br/>I like exploring (to a limited degree; since I've been having an awesome time gaming for years, I've never felt the need to look too deep into it) the nature of that incommensurable situation. Just kinda sitting it down and looking at it from different sides. Seeing what makes it tick. <br/><br/>I think that many others want to find out who is wrong; and from personal experience assign the label of Wrong to the group (for not playing by the rules/intention of the game), and thinking of ways to fix that so it doesn't happen.<br/><br/>Hmmm.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros" title="Maedhros"><img alt="Maedhros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros">Maedhros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150186/#Comment_150186" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T13:29:17+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  1:29PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>To him the confrontation with the scout was a big deal, a tense expression of his deep character backstory, a moment when he would have to act in a (gamistly) sub-optimal way to follow his story ideals.

I find that really interesting. <br/><br/>Mentioning Spione made me think about this: All of Ron Edwards' games that Ive read have, like, at least a paragraph about the back-and-forth negotiations for things like scene framing, right in there with the mechanics. I always used to read Sorcerer and such going "Okay, now we're in the rules bit, now here's some suggestions on how to do it, now rules again..."<br/><br/>Nope. They're all rules. (Alternately, they're all suggestions, although Ron specifically addresses that interpretation and says "No, I'm serious, these are the rules.")<br/><br/> As for the idea that negotiation of a social contract is a time-waster in a lot of situations, I personally disagree. My wife and I had spent some time a while back in a raiding guild in World of Warcraft. Okay, computer game, obviously the rules are the rules (the "GM" is the server, as impartial as it gets. There's no Rule Zero at all.) I'm bringing this up just to contrast with board games.<br/><br/>The very process of getting people logged on at the same time to do something, though? All Social Contract. Things fell apart not for mechanical reasons, but because of the "clash of playing aesthetic", so to speak. We had two dozen people trying to engage in the same activity, and there was no consensus on *why* people were doing it or what they wanted out of it. Some folks wanted to explore new zones, some wanted a challenge harder than they'd done before, some wanted to hang out with their friends and kibitz while blowing up monsters. <br/><br/>In that kind of situation you do kind of have a human GM, in that the person who's Raid Leader is making a lot of high-level decisions. As it turned out he made decisions as to what content should be attempted, and how, based solely on his own goals. It wasn't that he didn't care about anyone elses reasons for being there so much as he just didn't think about it, and didn't ask. He honestly didn't get why people were complaining -- we were killing monsters, weren't we?<br/><br/>It got to a point where people who weren't enjoying themselves saw that there was no recourse, and simply stopped signing up to come raid. The response was not "Hey, if you guys aren't having fun, what can we do to make it more fun?", it was "Man, I wish these folks would stop being so passive aggressive." From there you just have bitching and so on.<br/><br/>So in my interpretation, you have there a situation where despite the extremely clear separation of mechanics and the social context, with no opportunity for confusion, the two still got confused and the social situation broke down. That leads me personally to feel pretty strongly that any situation involving &gt;1 person that is going to be time-consuming is well worth having a Social Contract groundrules discussion. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150196/#Comment_150196" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T13:41:17+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  1:41PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jeffrey Straszheim</cite>Val,<br/><br/>Fair enough, but roleplaying game are<i>different</i>in a lot of ways from standard board games and such, so we shouldn't be too surprised if their social conventions just don't resemble Monopoly.<br/><br/>Some people actually like a playstyle where the rules take (more-or-less) a back seat, the the GM's spontaneity is critical.<br/><br/>I suspect you *hate* this style of play -- but whatever.<br/><br/>Rule-zero is a godsend for folks who play this way.</blockquote>\nWhile rule-zero can work for this, I find that a better godsend for this purpose is rules that emphasize spontaneity (like Amber or Everway, perhaps, or from a different angle Primetime Adventures or Polaris), rather than using rules that I constantly have to ignore in order to get spontaneity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150197/#Comment_150197" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T13:42:25+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  1:42PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2008 1:51PM by Jesse.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Maedhros</cite><br/>I applaud the GMs action, because were I another player in that game I would be bored stiff waiting for that sequence to play out while Travis provoked a fight simply to churn through the combat rules.

Indeed there are procedures for doing so.  One of the things that I used to find exhausting while planning a D&amp;D game is applying the rules for "Scaling" a monster or applying classes to it.  So many players told me that I should "eye ball it" and I just couldn't do that in good conscience.  All those procedures and adjustments and scales have significant tactical ramifications and I felt like I was "cheating" if I wasn't sure I had done all the calculations fair and square.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150208/#Comment_150208" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T14:13:59+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  2:13PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite><br/>I would agree.

My challenge to the heroes was "find the temple"<br/><br/>Now, I had no idea what the town looked like or who lived there or where the temple was hidden. The 4e skill challenge allowed each player to decide how their character would hunt down this knowledge and we went around the table with each person roleplaying their character doing something in a part of the town they were creating on the fly and I as GM would bounce off of them to fill in descriptions and away we went. Each person answered the question "how would my character accomplish this?" and each person choose different routes to success.<br/><br/>Dice rolls told us if their plan brought them closer to their knowledge and dice failures put cultists on their tail or caused time to pass closer toward midnight when everyone assumed the cultists who do their sacrifice.<br/><br/>I ran this skill challenge with three different groups. Each time, the group got into the scene and gave me fun bits to work with and we bounced them around the table weaving the story of the skill challenge. It was incredibly fun and FAR better structured than most indie games where the GM is relegated to a secondary role. The 4e skill challenge allows the GM to retain story control, but allows the players to get wildly creative and deeply into their character.<br/><br/>Could you do this with any RPG? Fuck yeah, but they did not and 4e did so I tip my hat to this incredibly fun idea that I will be porting over to other games.<br/><br/>My fav was the Dwarf Fighter whose player felt he had no skills that made sense and felt that he could not participate. I told him to forget the numbers and think how his Dwarf would seek this knowledge. His answer was to go to the worst, sleazest scumbag tavern and beat the shit out of everyone until somebody gave him a clue he could take back to group. We roleplayed out the look of the place, him kicking down the door and making his opening statement and decribed the brawl and the ugly, smashing finale.<br/><br/>I had him lose a healing surge for the wounds and then make an Endurance roll to see if he could be last man standing in the brawl. And boom, he was part of the group skill challenge, added a cool bit to the game and really set in stone WHO his character was. The player was thrilled and the others told him how that scene added to the fun. It took 2-3 minutes that gave him the complete spotlight and moved the story forward.<br/><br/>If that isn't roleplaying, what is?<br/></blockquote>\nIf that isn't rule zero, what is?<br/><br/>If we are going to consider Travis' problem, at least we should look at some successes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150230/#Comment_150230" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T15:02:14+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  3:02PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2008 3:02PM by Jesse.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jeffrey Straszheim</cite><br/>But how about this:  who will agree that Drama resolution in Everway is barely distinguishable in motive and effect from rule zero?</blockquote>\nI would have to reread Everway to see how it's presented.

Instead I've seen two people arguing their point of view, wanting it their way.

(Again, I haven't even seen the books yet, so I claim no knowledge.)<br/><br/>But even then, I'm now curious if healing surges are a kind of unit of health one can give and take quite easily.... and if, again, the DM was simply applying a general rule to a specif situation.  I'm extrapolating wildly here, but it seems as if this, again, wouldn't be ignoring rules, but applying them.<br/><br/>That said, given the logic I am specifically using in my intuited and probably incorrect example (and I'm not speaking for anyone else), in cases where the GM uses general rules in interesting ways to resolve specific situations, is such bending "rule 0" or a good application of the rules.  <br/><br/>And, more importantly, like the term "railroading" is such applications of the rules not even called out in some cases because the players at the table are content, whereas in other cases frustration because the expectations of some of the players are in conflict with others?<br/><br/>In Spinichat's example, a player was deprived of the fight mechanics when he entered a fight.  But, of course, the Player wasn't looking for a fight.  He was looking to plug himself into the group skill challenge -- and the GM nimbly and effectively did this.  Travis WAS looking for a combat and was denied -- but because that <i>was</i> what he wanted he was frustrated.<br/><br/>My guess is this is more interesting that just different expectations.  It's the <i>focus</i> of the activity the players want to be engaged in in a given moment (a combat for example, or a skill challenge) and whether the GM is using rules effectively to let the player plug into the fiction via the rules (as Spinachat did) or having the GM just hand wave a situation while negating the rules out of existence.  <br/><br/>In one case the GM is meeting the Player's desire via the rules and letting the rules adjudicate; in the other the GM is disengaging the Player from the rules and just making up the conclusion of the event.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150307/#Comment_150307" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T22:28:51+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 10:28PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2008 10:32PM by Moreno R..">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marco</cite>Moreno, your posts are pretty much entirely disconnected from what Jeffrey is saying because you are taking anything he says, casting it in an<i>extreme</i>form, and then attacking that extreme form.

When I called your link on logical fallacies your "strategy guide" I was joking--but this is pretty much verbatim attacking a straw man.<br/><br/>Your extreme focus on the idea that people who are okay with game-text that allows the GM to change the rules believe that the GM shouldn't talk to the players is a formulation of your own (and, I'm sure, filtered through whatever experience you have). No one is advocating stony silence as a<i>best practice</i>. What's going on is that people you are arguing with have the temerity to simply shrug at rules text that does not<span style="text-decoration: underline;">mandate</span>discussion with the PCs and you can't understand why they don't share your passion in condemning that rule set.</blockquote>\nMarco, I think that you unwillingness to find any fault in a game text (and, specifically, in the text that advocates rule zero) is clouding your logic and judgment. This last post is a good example of this.<br/><br/>You start with the usual "derailment technique", of talking about some other thing (in this case, the way, you say, I am casting what Jeffrey says "in an extreme form"), and then you go to score the bigger "own goal" (it's the right word? When you kick the ball in your own net...) I have ever seen in these discussions.<br/><br/>First: I am talking about a GM who made an ad hoc decision, hand-waving the rules, against the acting player's wishes. Do you think that this is an EXTREME case, that nobody has ever seen in the history of rpg? You wish. <br/>And, in any case, this was was Jesse talked about. This. <br/>This is the thread about that specific case. In that case, this is what happened.  What is this "taking the extreme form" you are talking about? The staying on topic? I should talk about some other thing because the topic is too "extreme" for you?<br/><br/>But this is not the worst of your reply. <br/><br/>From the beginning of these discussion, I have said many, many times, against the derailing of the thread and the people who wanted to think that rule zero was "you can use house rules" or similar banalities, that Rule Zero (or, if you prefer, the text I am complaining about) is THIS: "the GM can change or ignore any rule without telling the players, and can even fudge results"<br/><br/>Now, if the GM change the rules AND TELL IT TO THE PLAYERS, we have already said that IS NOT rule zero. It's house ruling.<br/><br/>Now, please, tell me, IF THE DEFINITION OF RULE ZERO DEPEND ON THE GM's SILENCE , on him fudging rolls behind a screen, and I am attacking THIS rule zero, and THIS silence.... can you tell me what kind of strange logic push you to post this reply, attacking me because I "assume that they would not talk to the players"?<br/><br/>It's like, talking about thief and robbers, you say "but you are too extreme, you condemn them assuming that they did not pay for the item they took"...<br/><br/>The biggest discussion fumble I have seen in a lot of time, and more proof that this discussion has left the rational level, from the moment it began to touch the "power and authority of the GM".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150360/#Comment_150360" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T05:27:47+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  5:27AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Albert and Christopher,<br/><br/>I have read the rules, and the GM was going outside their framework charging a healing surge there.

If the vampire text says the GM can pitch the rules in the preface, and Everway says it in the body of the text, what is the difference?<br/><br/>I'm expecting someone here (not you) to make some byzantine chain of non-logic trying to find a distinction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150368/#Comment_150368" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T05:54:16+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  5:54AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2008 6:05AM by Marco.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite><br/>Now, if the GM change the rules AND TELL IT TO THE PLAYERS, we have already said that IS NOT rule zero.

What's at issue here is difference between the two kinds of "outside the text" decisions that we ALL MAKE in actually applying any game text to play: principled decisions and ad-hoc decisions. A principled decision is one that follows along an established pattern of play (be that social contract expectations, the "spirit of the rules", genre convention, or internal consistency). An ad-hoc decision is one that gets made because right now, right here, that's what the decider wants to have happen.<br/><br/>The ideal game is one where it is at least possible to have the majority of play occur in the space defined by text+principled decisions (where principles are clearly communicated and shared).<br/><br/>In practice, a lot of the time it's hard for someone other than the GM in a standard strong-GM game to know which one is which, because the GM is privy to a bunch of hidden information that gives context to apparently ad-hoc decisions.

We can't share them fully. Most games are NOT fictionally or socially mediated - it is explicitly not allowed to interpret moves with reference to anything outside the text. RPGs are different - it is explicitly *expected* that players will engage in a process of interpretation of fiction through rules, and rules through fiction. The social component is less often acknowledged, but it's there: "Make sure everyone is having fun", "be fair and impartial", etc.<br/><br/>And Jeffrey, first of all, can you suggest a better term than "principled", one you feel is less loaded? It is meant to denote decisions that are guided by a consistent principle or standard, as opposed to spur-of-the-moment ad-hoc decisions. And my whole point is that it's very difficult to say for sure when a decision is "principled" or not in isolation from the entirety of text, play group history, and fictional circumstance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150402/#Comment_150402" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T06:59:05+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  6:59AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite><br/>And Jeffrey, first of all, can you suggest a better term than "principled", one you feel is less loaded?

And if forensics are to be done, at least some distinctions have to be made.<br/><br/>I think eveyrone should step back a moment and look over the last few posts.  Jeffrey, you keep using the word "debate" and "win."  I'm pretty sure that simply isn't Mark's agenda -- and certainly not mine.  If I jumped in it's because I'm curious about this very issue in the <i>Sorcerer</i> game I'm running. I'm seeking <i>understanding</i>, not a victory.<br/><br/>Marco is right.  The issue is nuanced.  But "winning" for you seems to be to steamroll over any distinctinon that might be found between Vampire's rule 0, the drama mechanic from Everway, Patrick's ruling in the D&amp;D game, and Spinichcat's ruling the in D&amp;D game.  Seriously? Dude? You see no distinctions of interest?<br/><br/>When I read Mark posts about Principled and Ad Hoc rulings, I thought, "Well, yeah, that's an execellent point. It sums up exactly the point I was making using the examples of how Patrick made a ruling and and how Spinichcat made a ruling."<br/><br/>But Jeffrey, instead of looking at how such distinctions might be useful, you jump on the word "principled"?  I mean, that was kind of weird.<br/><br/>And then a few posts down you say you're not sure if the distinction between "ad hoc" and "principled" is really all that worthwhile, anyhow.  Well, clearly.  Because you don't think ANY distinctions are worth much.  Now, whether you do this to protect the sanctity of Rule 0, beause you like winning, because you're incapible of making distinctions, I do not know.  <br/><br/>But some of us do think distinctions are worth making.  <br/><br/>I'm not expecting to change anyone's mind (Jeffrey or anyone).  I'm pointing out there are two things happening in this thread at the same time.  One is trying to come to an understanding of the distinctions between good and bad special case rules decisions on the part of the GM.  The other is arguing with a man who thinks the distinctions don't exist.<br/><br/>These two goals can only grind with one another.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150430/#Comment_150430" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T08:35:20+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  8:35AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Decisions based on principles in this context means nothing more than recognizing that there are existing rules that work a certain way therefor, when decisions get made to resolve issues that aren't in the rules they should be based on the same principles as the rules that already exist.

That is balderdash.<br/><br/>My thoughts:  Spinichat's ruling was really cool, whether or not is becomes a tradition in his group.

My gut tells me that some of the frustration being vented in these threads boils down to those things specifically. <br/><br/>If some folks think "That never happens, or if it does the game's dysfunctional" and others think "That's how the game works", then there's a pretty significant disconnect. When these things apply and to what areas of the game is pretty open for discussion as well -- even in trying to formulate this post I realized I was conflating things like "GM's secret plot" with "GM's secret rule knowledge". <br/><br/>I do think that if you're playing a game where only the GM is familiar with the rules, then the actual rules of the game, which you should either agree to or not, are "GM is sole arbiter of mechanics". I think to some extent, in some social groups, that might be translate to GM fiat being the sole resolution mechanic.<br/><br/>(On a separate note, with my "I can't help trying to mediate conflicts, no matter how hard I try" hat on, I'll say that my reading experience on this forum has been much more pleasant after making this one decision: If a thread's part discussion and part "debate who's right", I try to participate in the discussion and ignore the rest of it. So far it seems to have lowered my blood pressure considerably.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A" title="Albert A"><img alt="Albert A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://web.mac.com/albertwa/Ryoanji.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A">Albert A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150447/#Comment_150447" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T09:11:52+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  9:11AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jeffrey Straszheim</cite>Albert and Christopher,<br/><br/>I have read the rules, and the GM was going outside their framework charging a healing surge there.

The charging of a healing surge is likely to be <i>very</i> relevant, given how important they are as a currency in 4th ed.  You might be correct that it would be better to only charge him if he loses, but I don't think that effects the central point: this was an application of rule zero that worked well, and has some basic similarities to one that worked poorly for Travis.  It is worth figuring out why.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros" title="Maedhros"><img alt="Maedhros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros">Maedhros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150493/#Comment_150493" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T10:53:30+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 10:53AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite><br/>But clearly, one issue does stand out: sometimes player fun grinds to a halt (the Travis example) and sometimes it doesn't (the player of the Dwarf who got to participate in the skill challenge, for example).</blockquote>\nI think it is a mistake to view this issue as Travis v. GM.  There is a table dynamic to consider - Travis' fun doesn't trump the table's as a whole.  Let's look at two examples, changing the names to protect the innocent:<br/><br/>Table A:<br/><br/>The general table dynamic is for character-driven play.  The PCs encounter a caravan, so the players have the PCs approach the owning merchant and his entourage with the intent of roleplaying out the scene.  John's grizzled veteran recognizes one of the merchant's guards as a despicable assassin and John announces that his character hacks down the assassin before any dialogue is begun.  <br/><br/>In this case, the other players were gearing up for a scene involving dialogue, diplomacy and intrigue with the merchant.  John wanted combat.  If the GM shortcuts by ruling that John's character cuts down the assassin in cold blood, then play can progress seamlessly - with the added complication that one of the PCs just murdered one of the merchant's retainers.  While John might feel slighted by this, the rest of the table is relieved because they wanted the roleplaying not the fighting.  Since John's intent was not thwarted (he wanted to kill the assassin; assassin was killed) there's no foul.  This was an appropriate ruling by the GM, because the integrity of the overall flow of the game is more important than one player's desire to tilt it toward combat when the general mood is for roleplay.<br/><br/>Table B:<br/><br/>The general dynamic is mission accomplishment.  The situation is the same as above, but the general mood at the table is to achieve the mission goal as efficiently as possible.  The encounter with the caravan is a set-up for a big tactical fight between the PCs and the caravan.  The GM short-circuiting John's attempt to initiate the fight is obstructive, because it drags out the "intro" to the fight when the intent of the players is to engage quickly.  <br/><br/>It wasn't clear from the OP what table dynamic was in play.  If it was Dynamic A, then it's wrong to accuse the GM of vikinghatitis because he was facilitating a better experience for the group.  If it was Dynamic B, then sure - it was inappropriate.  But then again, if the assumption is that NPCs exist only as fodder for combat then were straying a bit from a "story game" point of view, so I would say there are better forums than this one for the discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150525/#Comment_150525" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T11:58:46+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 11:58AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2008 11:59AM by JDCorley.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can certainly conceive of, and perhaps remember, a few situations where a GM decision filling in a hole in the game rules that appealed to (what I perceived as) the central design principle of the game would have been disastrous for the group's enjoyment, so I have no problem saying that "principled" play is not always necessarily better than "unprincipled", if we must use that awful phraseology.

A character attempts to do something not covered by the rules. If I, the GM, turn to that dynamic, I could (for example) give the obstacle a number of "hit points" and determine how effectively the characters action depletes those "hit points", which might be highly unsatisfactory to myself and the other players, who just want to know whether it works or not, or don't think ablative resistance is appropriate for the obstacle, and so on.

I don't think you get that I am okay with what I see as your basic philosophy (i.e. rules that allow GMs to change rules are improved by explicitly mandating player interaction and discussion).<br/><br/>Where we seem to differ is this, as far as I can tell:<br/>1. You think that the presence of those rules is the <i>cause</i> of <i>serious</i> dysfunction in many or most groups [yes / no?]<br/>2. You think that the presence of those rules--wherever they are--whether advice, a literal first-page mechanic, a sidebar, etc. seriously degrades the quality of the game book [yes / no?]<br/>3. You see rules that explicitly limit the GM's ability to change things on the fly as <i>completely</i> different than rules that don't have explicit limits [y/n?]<br/><br/>I'm not sure if I even have all this right--but if I do: it seems like a philosophical debate. If you believe the vast majority of traditional games are horribly broken, I don't know what to tell you--I think you're wrong there. I think history bears me out that people clearly play them and enjoy them.<br/><br/>If you think every event of those rules that don't have explicit you-must-communicate wording in them could be <i>improved</i> by that wording, hey? We agree. I'll sign a petition saying that I think every place in the book where they tell the GM to do something outside of / in violation of the rules, they should make it clear to the players they're doing that.<br/><br/>I mean--this, seriously, strikes me as a no-brainer.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150532/#Comment_150532" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T12:21:52+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 12:21PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2008 12:22PM by Jeffrey Straszheim.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...

Also, theory talk almost always bores the fuck out of me, which is why I rarely read such threads (though it started out with some cool stories).  There were a lot of off-the-rails moments, and plenty of "wrongs" and "incommensurables" circulating on all sides of the debate. It appears to be over and done with, and I hate to feel like the cop who comes in to bust up a house party long after everyone's cleaned up and left, but yeah, let's take the meaty word-fists down a few notches. <br/><br/>People are forming grudges about people they never met, for a few words traded over a medium they otherwise all believe in. That's the internet, I guess. But I think things could be helped if people just recognized that behavior, and maybe walked away before their blood starts boiling? <br/><br/>In any case, another theory-inspired punch debate kerfluffle. Yawn.

It's sad that people bolted instead of talking about this part, because I think there's some wrongness and rightness in there:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jeffrey Straszheim</cite>Regarding the "principled" thing: we can't ignore its context.  Vincent is clearly suggesting the superiority of a certain "forgey" style metagamey play style that he likes.  I mean .. that is obvious, right?  The term "principled" is prejudicial, full stop.</blockquote>\nLooking at the definitions of principled and ad-hoc from the original post (quoted earlier in the thread), this sentiment is totally wrong. Full stop. <br/><br/>Quoted from Mark W (if someone else can find where the original defs appeared, that might help):\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>principled decisions and ad-hoc decisions. A principled decision is one that follows along an established pattern of play (be that social contract expectations, the "spirit of the rules", genre convention, or internal consistency). An ad-hoc decision is one that gets made because right now, right here, that's what the decider wants to have happen.</blockquote>\nThere's nothing judgmental in there. At all. One is talking about going with what the rules have said up to this point, and the other is about making up something new or on the fly because it's needed, even though it has no root in the rules or "social contract" (what the group has done until now).  It's not hard to think of examples of both that many of us think of as "good". The decision to just say "ok you whack that NPC and he dies; no roll", and "ok let's say that we'll gloss over the ensuing fight, but you lose one healing surge, ok?"... both of those are Ad Hoc (at least according to Vincent, filtered through Mark W anyway), and most of us would agree that both were awesome, and moved play along (save maybe "Travis" for the first example :-) ).<br/><br/>The part where you're right is, again, perhaps the terms were chosen poorly. If you have never heard the definitions before, native English speakers here principled, and think "moral, correct, solid, good". Ad hoc, while by the definition doesn't convey any negative connotations (edit: maybe it does? "for the particular end or case at hand <i>without consideration of wider application</i>", kinda conveys not thinking it through), when we hear it compared to another type of thing ad hoc seems to take on a connotation of sloppy, hasty, etc.<br/><br/>It's a weird phenomenon here. I work in the tech industry, which has tons of loanwords or terms, and there's not a lot of confusion about their definition. From what I recall of sociology and philosophy as well (and this might be rose-tinted glasses) I didn't see a lot of term confusion either.<br/><br/>I mean, well, what can we do, right? At least in that area the terms are defined and all. The best we can do is assume the best in people and assume that he was simply labeling a phenomenon he saw, and not declaring value judgments.
