I'm signed up to run it at GenCon OZ despite never having really played it much, because I'm foolish and just want to show it off. So I need to get the hang of it before then. I'm running a game for friends on Monday, but I'd like to at least have it all settled in my head.<br/><br/>So I don't really get Favours and how they work. I know you can call in a favour owed to you during a conflict if it's relevant to get more chips? But how does it work when you get called in on one?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218437/#Comment_218437" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T08:58:55+00:00" title="July 15, 2009  8:58AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alexander, Alexander, Alexander...<br/><br/>(If you say his name three times, he appears.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon" title="David Pidgeon"><img alt="David Pidgeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon">David Pidgeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218439/#Comment_218439" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T09:07:21+00:00" title="July 15, 2009  9:07AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was hoping it would just kind of... happen, without me having to say it...<br/><br/>Is a mirror necessary?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218451/#Comment_218451" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T09:42:59+00:00" title="July 15, 2009  9:42AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello! Sorry, I don't monitor Story Games very often. My forum on The Forge emails me when posts are made, and S-G simply doesn't have that feature.<br/>\n<br/>\nFavors are probably the most fiddly bit of Fastlane. So, we're asking about what happens when someone calls in a favor <i>from you</i> during a conflict? If it's happening mid-conflict, and is supposed to affect that one conflict, simply burn the favor like anything else. Otherwise, if it happens outside of a conflict, treat it as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n(A) Individual X calls in favor (valued at Z) from Individual Y<br/>\n(B) Assuming Individual Y does not shirk or otherwise refuse the favor, Individual Y gets Z chips. Individual Y is now required to pursue the requested activity in any applicable conflict, and must bid at least Z chips each time*. These chips always come from the House, not from any player's Bank.<br/>\n(C) The favor is considered 'paid off' when completed<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the next edition is not printed yet, but please use these revised rules:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="http://www.twistedconfessions.com/files/FastlaneChanges.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.twistedconfessions.com/files/FastlaneChanges.pdf</a><br/>\n<br/>\n* Shirking entirely gives Z chips to Individual X. Meanwhile, refusing and asking for interest (the other option) increases the favor's value to Z+1.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that help?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218453/#Comment_218453" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T09:48:29+00:00" title="July 15, 2009  9:48AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you owe someone a favor, you have to do something for them, or shirk the favor. Once you've completed the task they set for you, you get chips based on how big a thing you did added to your bank, and the same amount removed from the favor.<br>\n<br>\nFor instance, Tony Two-Toes owes Bobby the Fingers a 5 point favor. If Bobby asks Tony to stand watch over a meeting, and it's an uneventful night, Tony will probably get 1 point taken off his favor, and one chip in his bank. If Bobby wants one of Tony's kidneys, that'd be worth the full 5 (and probably a bit more besides...) so the favor is canceled, and Tony gets 5 chips in his bank, several stitches, a bottle of pain meds and strict instructions to 'take it easy'.<br>\n<br>\nIt works this way even if your favor is owed to another PC. They get your services, you get chips back from paying off your debt. You can also do something similar out of conflict with NPCs. You get some task accomplished for you, they get points knocked off their favor (this does not affect the NPC's appraisal value, natch.)                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218455/#Comment_218455" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T09:53:05+00:00" title="July 15, 2009  9:53AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...huh!
