It will also bear a touch of sadness, a reminder of how little stands between life on the streets and tragedy.<br/><br/>I'm building a stock roleplaying game, but with some props as chosen and provided by the players. I have nothing to show people yet, and am still wrestling with so many themes, but I can't help shake the feeling that this time I'll be able to do the concept some justice, though it may take the full year to do so. That's okay. It was years between first thinking of the concept and finally being inspired by this year's Game Chef to take it the first few steps beyond that.<br/><br/>This is another game that will never see publication as the subject matter is too delicate. As a film it has worked many times, as a book it would be fine, but as a game...I dont' think it would find a market. Still, I cannot help but be driven by the concept, the sense that there's something important in there that can be better explored through a roleplaying game than in any other medium.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233800/#Comment_233800" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-23T02:46:28+00:00" title="September 23, 2009  2:46AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm writing a game called The Star &amp; The Cormorant. I had the concept groked within days and I hoped to have the rules down within weeks, but alas, real life calls and I haven't had time to sit down and crank out the rules and text for it. (My blog hasn't been updated in ages so I'm not even going to link it. There's nothing relevant there at the moment.)<br/><br/>It's a storytelling game that takes some of its colour from Victorian novels (Actually, The French Lieutenant's Woman is probably the biggest influence that way.). The theme is intrigue. Players create a cast of characters, each with their own secrets and relationships, and then you frame scenes, trying to figure out what kind of shame hides behind the reserved Victorian facade. It's got a frame-setting technique which I fancy is somewhat unique, but I might be completely wrong.<br/><br/>I've got at least two other games in the fire right now so I have no idea how GC will turn out for me if at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233806/#Comment_233806" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-23T04:09:53+00:00" title="September 23, 2009  4:09AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was my first Game Chef.

"Publication", as in "getting your game out there in a very polished state for people to play", is a worthy aim you <i>should </i>be pursuing, despite not having the prospect of blockbuster sales.  ^__^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234060/#Comment_234060" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-24T09:29:51+00:00" title="September 24, 2009  9:29AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is my first Game Chef and second contest attempt (the first being the BP Aero challenge).
