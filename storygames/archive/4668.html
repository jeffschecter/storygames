It's just too much like work. I don't mind others GMing, it's nice to have someone to hold the game together but the game's success depends upon their level of GMly skill. The GM is the game regardless of what the book says.  <br/><br/>For a GMless game it need really good light mechanics that promote lots of fun - mainly gaming and immersion, I don't care much about fluff. To be honest I haven't found anything since Baron Munchausen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105320/#Comment_105320" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T07:25:46+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  7:25AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since I GM all the time, I know what I am talking about:<br/><br/>1 - An interesting and engaging system. It can be light (Over the Edge and BRP are both fun to GM), or complicated (d20 is also fun to GM), but it has to be comprehensible and interesting (Theatrix loses here).  An interesting note, there is only one other player in our six-person group that gives a crap about system at all. Only two other people even learn any rules at all, and nobody other than myself and the one other person actually are interested in comparing systems, figuring out if this system is right or that one is right...I recently pulled a plug on a game whose system I was fighting and struggling frustratingly against, and everyone looked at me like I had just stabbed the family dog, because they loved the game and were getting everything they wanted out of it. Too bad for them it was a slogging nightmare for me to get the game to do what I wanted.  This reason, by the by, is why I scoff at "well you're just playing the GM".   I pick out games and game rules because I like them!<br/><br/>2 - An interesting and engaging setting or setting creation tools. Forgotten Realms falls into the first category, World of Darkness stuff falls into the second. Sometimes I have a different source material in mind (comics, books, movies), so there's that too.  Basically I want a setting where lots of things can happen, since my group dislikes introspection, romance and drama, and likes action and comedy.<br/><br/>3 - Time! The biggest limitation on my GMing a game has nothing to do with the game. I have lots of timesaving tricks for GMing but I don't always use all of them for the very simple reason that prepping games is fun!<br/><br/>Feel free to ask me any questions you like about why GMing is great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105330/#Comment_105330" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T07:56:21+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  7:56AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Genre that's appealing to me is the be-all, end-all.

This includes toolbooks on how to create a setting in a broad genre, like Star HERO or GURPS Space.  I probably won't run it in the system the book is intended for in those cases, but I will want to run it.<br/><br/>An interesting, focused system that works well.  I ram not as likely to run something with an entirely new system. I'll want to play it first.  Even if I get it intending to run it, unless the setting is really cool also, I'll talk myself out of running.<br/><br/>Low to zero "solo" prep.  I don't mind games that take a couple of hours to get ready, but that time should be as a group in character creation or something similiar.  And prep that's okay is thinking about story elements, not statting things up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105467/#Comment_105467" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T21:58:56+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  9:58PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like a system which gives me a structured role as GM.  I don't think I have it in me any more to run a lot of games that have a set of tricky rules, a complex setting, and look to me as GM to "just add Awesome" and make it all work together.  <br/><br/>I also like a system that encourages the Awesome to come from players and come up during play, rather than get manually loaded into the system by the GM prior to operation.  <br/><br/>I am always fond of a system which is detailed in spots but offers handy short-cuts for the GM.  Buffy is a good example of this; when I was running a game of this online, I could keep all of my NPC's in a single short text file, because NPC's usually just need a few stats.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhosmer1" title="jhosmer1"><img alt="jhosmer1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4446384493_29cc47b601_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhosmer1">jhosmer1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105538/#Comment_105538" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-30T10:57:18+00:00" title="October 30, 2007 10:57AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I haven't seen discussed here is the question: "If not me, then who?"<br/><br/>That's how I got thrust into GMing in the first place, a long time ago.

I've never even read Anna Karenina, mainly because my attempts to read Russian Literature, either for school or by choice, have ended with me falling asleep.

It really does count on first impression. It's a little embarassing to say, but I've bought some crap games that looked nice on impulse, and passed over some things i've later discovered to be brimming over with awesome because of poor presentation.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good blurb on the back of the book. Really, this counts for all books. Sacrificing that blurb for a novel design might be a mistake. I especially appreciate it when said blurb synopsizes the setting, depth, and scope of the game. Maybe I'm too average of a consumer, but I like to know what I'm holding and what it means to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnymore, however, my frugal ways and limited finances I rarely buy games on impulse. I now buy games on the advice of friends and reviewers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
