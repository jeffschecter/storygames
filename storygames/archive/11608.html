Since people have been asking about it, I thought I'd take it over here and go into some detail.<br/><br/>"Try a different way" was first developed specifically to handle this situation in GM-less games:\n<blockquote>Me: "The prince comes up to the princess and whispers some beautiful words."<br/>Other player: "But the princess looks frightened. She has a secret. What is it?"<br/>Annoying player: "She has a huge pimple on her butt!"<br/>Other player, going along with it for laughs: "Yes! She looks at the prince with tears in her eyes, showing him her butt!"<br/>Me: (Argh. Now we have to come back to this for the next three hours?)</blockquote>\nIf there's nobody who has the central authority to keep the vision steady, it's very easy for random stuff to destroy the fiction. Whether intentional or not - sometimes people just have different expectations or different thresholds for what's okay and not okay. In the example above I wished there was some formalized authority, some rule that let me say:\n<blockquote>"Aaaah, do it differently. Could we please not make this a silly game? I'd like to keep it at least a bit serious."</blockquote>\nAs a GM, you can just say this and everone accepts it. But if you're one player among many, and there aren't any rules for it, it's not that easy to bring up a complaint like this. <br/><br/>Now, experience has shown that the "try a different way" phrase can help a group handle this sort of thing in an efficient way that doesn't get awkward, or weird, or make people upset and rebellious. It's simply a phrase of courtesy, a magic word like saying "please" instead of just commanding people to pass the salt, or "sorry" instead of going through a long explanation of cause and effect and personal responsibility. When using the phrase, I'm not saying "I, personally, think you are an ass"; I'm saying "we're not creating the best possible narrative here, let's try something different".<br/><br/>However, as has been pointed out, it's a good idea to be explicit about what you want, especially to begin with. Just throwing out "try a different way!" can easily be seen as a challenge if you're not used to it. And that's not what the phrase is intended to do - it's there to help everyone perform better, the way they want to. So you should do stuff like this to begin with - formal and explicit:\n<blockquote>"Try a different way! We just established that the old kingdom had no firearm technology... I think having a huge space laser cannon just doesn't fit in. Perhaps a dragon or something instead?"<br/>"Try a different way! I really don't see the gay prince suddenly becoming hetero for no good reason. Can you bring in a different love interest?"</blockquote>\nNote that these examples are based on something really jarring being brought into the fiction. If someone narrates something that just derails the story for you, or ruins your suspension of disbelief, that's when your story reflexes should kick in; you pretty much have an obligation to the group to fix things, because if you, personally, lose interest or belief in the story, you're not going to be much use to the group. <br/><br/>As you get more used to the phrase, and the group gets more used to this style of play, you often don't have to be so explicit. You can just say "Try a different way!", and people will often know exactly what you mean - they knew it the moment they heard themselves say something that didn't really fit. <br/><br/>It's also possible to use the phrase more subtly, once you get a feeling for it. Instead of just using it when things really jar, you can use it to improve the story:\n<blockquote>"Try a different way!  Could we let the young girl NPC stay alive longer? She seems to have some dramatic potential..."<br/>"Try a different way! How about it's not just a treasure chest, but a chest with the map to the secret isle we heard about earlier?"</blockquote>\nNow, I keep saying stuff like "at first", "as you get used to it" etc. It takes a little practice to get used to, and it feels a little strange at first. That's just because most of us aren't used to getting instant constructive criticism like this, and we're afraid to give it. However, it's immensely useful once you're used to it. (Remember how hard it was to learn about setting scenes? Or thinking about relationship maps? Now you can't do without them).<br/><br/>I'm trying out different ways of teaching this phrase, and I think probably the best way is just direct practice. I'd recommend a sandbox approach: Try out an improvised story using characters and locations you know - Luke and Leia and Yoda, or whatever. Take turns narrating. Start your turn very true to the original in spirit, then start pushing the boundaries (Leia starts stripping for Yoda! Luke gets drunk and punches Yoda in the face!) until someone says "Try a different way!" After you've tried a different way, finish your turn at leisure (a few more sentences) and let the next player try.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258805/#Comment_258805" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T13:42:47+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  1:42PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's also a whole lot of talk that can be done during chargen to make sure that everyone is on the same page with the game's inspirational sources so that once the game hits the table, this kind of thing is kept to a minimum.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258812/#Comment_258812" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T14:20:14+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  2:20PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This technique has its uses.

And I want gameplay to delve into that setting. So, the kind of problem you've addressed here is a central one for me. I did it a little differently, though. I have a key phrase, <strong>That does not sound right.</strong> You need to back it up with either a real-world fact, or an established bit of canon, that contradicts what someone just said. That person then has two choices: she can either accept it and write it off as a mistake, or escalate, and make it an issue. So, if I say something ridiculous (for a post-civilized setting like this), "The chief goes up to the mini-mart," someone else might say, "That does not sound right! There are no mini-marts four hundred years after the collapse of civilization!" If I give, I might say, "Oh, yeah, you're right; he went to the shaman's hut." Or, if I decide I want to escalate this, I might say, "Right! So, what is this place doing here?" It becomes one of the issues we need to deal with in the game.<br/><br/>So far, it's worked out splendidly. In fact, in my first playtest at Dreamation, a use of this turned out to add a critical turning point to our story. Someone used it to raise the issue about a character who was apparently in two places at once. When he escalated, it became an issue for the game to address, and we found out he had a look-a-like among the Chesterton, and that everything drawing us towards war had come from the two of them conspiring together towards that end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258894/#Comment_258894" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T01:08:18+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  1:08AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2010 2:03AM by Matthijs.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel, I've never heard of Phoenix Wright.

If players feel the need to constantly stop up and defend their ideas, they should probably make a conscious effort to change their behavior for a session or two, just to see where that takes them. Sometimes when playing I need to accept that this idea I brought in just isn't what the group wants right now; so I try something different and keep the story going.<br/><br/>Jason, the escalation sounds interesting.<br/><br/>[Edited to say what I meant, instead of what I wrote in the first place]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258908/#Comment_258908" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T06:44:50+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  6:44AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs,<br/><br/>Pheonix Wright is a a series of Japanese law console games where (I'm told) you (as Pheonix Wright, Attorny at Law) investigate your cases, and then during the court trial you declare "Objection!" to specific statements that do not line up with the facts or are otherwise problematic. This objection mechanic seemed very similar to "Try a different way!".<br/><br/>On a separate note, what happens if "Try a different way!" is used falsely - like "Try a different way! There aren't any wizards in that room." Can a valid response be, "there are since I just locked them in there last time I narrated." Sometimes players don't actually share the mythical shared imagined space (or what have you). <br/><br/>Banning discussion on this seems an unhealthy side-effect of "accepting the objection and moving on." In the very least it inadvertantly leaves the player who is trying again in the state of aiming toward an unknown target, as they have lost their ability to rely upon their knowledge of the fiction without knowing what has replaced it. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258910/#Comment_258910" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T07:11:46+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  7:11AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds a lot like Appeal from my game Dirty Secrets. Person A says something which violates Person B's sense of the world, so Person B can Appeal. However, the rules impact is a little tighter. Person A *must* rework his narration to satisfy Person B *unless* one of the other players Upholds Person A's original narration. In this case, the original narration stands.<br/><br/>This provides a lot of freedom to those narrating, while allowing the audience (i.e. the other players) to judge the result. The ultimate test for narration to stand is if someone is willing to stand up for it in the face of an objection.<br/><br/>Of course, this does mean that two players could throw the entire game askew by being jerks, but that sort of problem needs to be addressed on the social level. The Appeal and Uphold rules are there to allow for creative synchronizing, not to correct bad behavior.

I first thought of it when playing with friends who are good players, but sometimes get too silly for my taste. That's the origin of the idea, but not the reason why I use it now. I don't mean to pitch it as a cure for Annoying Players.<br/><br/>I think everyone around the table has to accept that we can never be perfect, and if we narrate stuff that doesn't work, it's okay to accept that, change it, and move on. <br/><br/>Seth's term "creative synchronizing" is spot on. Our ideas are like a flock of sheep (yeah yeah, it's the first metaphor I could think of); the phrases are the shepherds' dogs, keeping the flock coherent, moving in the same direction. It's about keeping ideas working together, not about correcting "bad player behavior". <br/><br/>Mendel, what you're describing sounds like something that could theoretically happen, but I haven't seen it during play. People seem to already know, more or less, when they've narrated something that doesn't fit the collective vibe. Calling them on it is doing everyone a favor, and giving them the chance to do better.<br/><br/>The tool is part of a whole mindset, the way I see it. If you're not there to cooperate; if you're there to push your own vision of the fiction and fight anyone who wants to influence you; then this sort of tool won't work for you. If you can see the idea as separate from your own identity, so you won't feel attacked when your idea is challenged, it will work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis" title="RivoClavis"><img alt="RivoClavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis">RivoClavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258981/#Comment_258981" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T16:20:47+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  4:20PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have one main co-player and we rather often have conflicts in understanding of our shared fiction (he is very verbal thinking, I am visual minded.)

Usually my scrunched up expression is signal enough for an elaboration, otherwise I will ask for one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe elaboration means that I can quickly catch up on his line of reasoning and we can work out a mutually satisfactory compromise, on the terms of the current narrator, without breaking out of the game flow. It also gives me the chance to agree with the original statement if the reasoning is sound, without automatically invalidating the point as the first thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259074/#Comment_259074" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-28T06:39:15+00:00" title="February 28, 2010  6:39AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Mendel, what you're describing sounds like something that could theoretically happen, but I haven't seen it during play.

Suffice it to say, I'm talking about something I've seen occur often enough that I worry about a technique that shuts down the discussion that helps everyone get closer to the same page. <br><br>As a technique in Archipelago, I'm intrigued to see what this approach to synching player perspectives will do. But as far as advice in general, I see some fundamental practical problems - in that if this technique had been used, rather than discussion, then the game could easily have ended in a dysfunctional social explosion rather than continuing after a short digression. <br/><br/>And that could have happened because there was no mechanical bite to the fact that another player essentially told me "Try a different way! Your characters aren't on the planet any more." And no one was being purposely obstinant, there were just misrememberings and misinterpretations. <br/><br/>Things needed to be sorted out - and this technique as you describe it can play like a game of 20 questions in that respect or just feel like you trying at all. Because once you call into doubt something you thought was accepted and "certain", then you have to ask, what else am I wrong about? Trust me, it is paralyzing. <br/><br/> - Mendel                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
