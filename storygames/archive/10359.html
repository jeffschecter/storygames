Skills will be harmonised but will now be ranked as Rudimentary, Solid, Expert or Master level; some traits will operate outside this system but for basic play this number will be very limited (Literacy being a major example). Provisionally, CharGen will be available both as points-buy as per the original game and as random CharGen with a fixed points value.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly one dice type will be used (d12).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Omnifray speed of action system will be carried over in much simplified form - it is currently envisaged that speed modifiers will not change due to using different weapons or being injured.<br/>\n<br/>\nCombat will typically be reduced to two rolls per attack:- a speed of action roll and an attack roll. There might be a fallout roll as well for some characters. For player characters there will only be 5 levels of injury:- uninjured, injured, seriously injured, mortally injured and dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe magic/fate/feats system will be rewritten from the ground up (inspired by the original but probably tied into the core stats system and in any event much simpler) and a stances system incorporated. Tendencies will now be a core part of the game. xp will be directly spendable on stats. Spiritual alignments will be retained as they stand but renamed, provisionally Primordial, Fallen, Redeemed and Alien to emphasise delinkage with behavioural tendencies.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a principal design goal to achieve a similar level of simplicity to the more popular commercial games.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be an assumed non-specific setting type, the principal assumption being that magic is hidden from the common folk and that technology is limited to full plate armour and arbalests (no firearms), other assumptions being that there is a spectral realm, a ghost realm and probably a seelie realm and an unseelie realm (rather than a single fey realm).<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope to produce a 200 page fully illustrated softback - we shall see. [B]Due to pirating problems affecting downloadable copies of the original Omnifray books, it is unlikely that the full version will be made available to download.[/B]<br/>\n<br/>\nAny and all feedback on what you like or dislike about the Omnifray system or setting would be most welcome at this time. I can be contacted via PM on this site or via the feedback section at:- [url]http://www.omnifray.com[/url] --- I will also check this thread to see if anyone has posted public feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nIndie RPG Omnifray is a traditional RPG, not a Forgite storygame with outright player narrative control (although it does allow player storyline influence if you pick the right stuff), but storygamer feedback is more than welcome and all suggestions will be considered.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really would be very grateful for any and all feedback! If public, please not too offensive!!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230348/#Comment_230348" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T04:21:42+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  4:21AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2009 4:25AM by Thunder_God.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, you tell us of the changes from Omnifray to Omnifray Lite, but I have never heard of Omnifray itself, so this is not very helpful to me... For instance, the magic/fate/feats paragraph means next to nothing to me. I only understand the "XP spendable directly on stats", but I don't know how it was before, so I can't appreciate the change.<br/><br/>BTW, if you want the code to work, at the bottom of your comment space choose "Format comments as: BBCode", it will remember your settings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

It's<br/>\nonly fair to say that it's a relatively complicated game, presented in a fairly<br/>\ncomplicated way. Reviews on rpg.net (5/5 for substance but 2/5 for style),<br/>\nrpgsite.com (negative but witty) and critical-hits.com (dismissive). Most of <br/>\nthe negativity seems to come from things like people not liking tables and<br/>\ncomplex chargen rules, and the fact that there is a lot of dense text in the <br/>\nmain books (like half a million words actually). Omnifray Lite is going to turn <br/>\nthat approach on its head. The game will be run without tables (well, almost <br/>\nentirely - it depends what you count as a table, I guess) and there will be a <br/>\nlot less text to read. The character generation system will be several orders <br/>\nof magnitude simpler. Only one dice type will be used (d12 - it's the best<br/>\ndice).<br/>\n<br/>\nJoshua:- <br/>\n<br/>\n- what do I do as a player?<br/>\n&gt; you play your character - in original Omnifray you may, and in Omnifray Lite<br/>\n&gt; you do, have the option of indirect narrative input via Fate Points / Luck, but<br/>\n&gt; it is strictly ref-filtered input - and might only be once per session per player,<br/>\n&gt; or slightly more, or slightly less...<br/>\n&gt; you are encouraged to help create mystery, plot and intrigue for the other players<br/>\n&gt; and/or actively dig around in the mystery, plot and intrigue created by the ref<br/>\n&gt; and other players - in Omnifray Lite, this will carry an xp award<br/>\n<br/>\n- what do I do as a GM?<br/>\n&gt; you run the game - you may sketch out some plot ideas to begin with, but<br/>\n&gt; heavy railroading is discouraged and you are supposed to be responsive<br/>\n&gt; to indirect narrative input from the players when they are entitled to give it...<br/>\n&gt; you are supposed to facilitate and create mystery, plot and intrigue<br/>\n<br/>\n- what do the characters do<br/>\n&gt; whatever whoever is running them decides and the ref/rules/dice allow<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, it's a traditional RPG. I'm not sure if that answers your question<br/>\nor not but please clarify your question if it doesn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
