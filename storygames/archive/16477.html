Could you tell me how you've done this, and how it worked out? Were there themes or issues you wanted to foreground? How much did you narrow the skin options?

An easy example is a Ghoul &amp; a Ghost, or a Ghoul &amp; a Hollow. They're just similar enough to gravitate toward one another, and just different enough to "miss the point" of one another's struggles.<br/><br/>I've enjoyed setting up situations where the town's wider social problems are wound up in the petty teenage antics that are taking place. Maybe The Serpentine (from an old money family that runs the mine) and The Werewolf (a miner's boy with a wicked bite) start sleeping together, and their relationship captures the awkward and complicated class politics of the town.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ethan K.</cite>How much did you narrow the skin options?</blockquote>\nPretty narrow. I've tried leaving players only two decisions (pick your final move, allocate your Strings), and it's worked great. I've also rewritten flavour text to be character-specific (rather than Skin-specific), and I've retooled and removed moves to cultivate the ideal version of a certain monster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377391/#Comment_377391" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T18:28:56+00:00" title="May  9, 2012  6:28PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I've enjoyed setting up situations where the town's wider social problems are wound up in the petty teenage antics that are taking place.
