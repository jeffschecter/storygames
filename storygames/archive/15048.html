Beliefs, Desires, Issues and Dispositions are all internally driven.  Influences are supposed to represent external factors that drive or complicate things for the character.  (Maybe that should be stated explicitily)<br/><br/>Im just not sure whether that is a valid way to categorize a character motivation or not.  Its a bit handwavy, and looking at the suggestions that people have given so far, it probably points to 'Influences' just being a mix of things that could easilly belong in any of the other four categories.<br/><br/>The only reason to categorize at all is to help people come up with a range of motivations for their own characters.  I think another thing I need to do, besides provide examples, is some questions players could answer for their characters, a few under each Motivation.<br/><br/>i.e. for Issues, a good question is "What does your character get emotional about"<br/><br/><b>beliefs</b>: \ufffcIdeas and convictions that the character is prone to act on. These tell what a character stands for -\xad\u2010-\xad\u2010 What type of person they are.<br/><b>desires</b>: \ufffcAn urge characters are likely to go out of their way to satisfy. Primarily drivers.<br/><b>issues</b>: \ufffcSomething that emotionally troubles the character such that, in some situations, they may be driven to irrational plans or inexplicable (for them) behavior. Emotional complications.<br/><b>influences</b>: \ufffcRelationship, social bond or situation that is likely to effect the character\u2019s behavior. Drivers and complications.<br/><b>dispositions</b>: \ufffcAttitude towards another PC that is likely to affect interactions with that character in a way th will drive or complicate things for your character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
