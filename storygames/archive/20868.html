Is it possible to make a GMless game were the plot and NPCs are directed (kind of like a game with a GM) rather than improvized or made in a collaborative way (maybe it would need players to take turns GMing? or maybe there is a mechanical answer?) and the game could have somewhat longish campaign, kind like a PbtA game without the MC. Basically, the players would be going into encounters and experiencing the plot 'blind' most of the time, without framing a scene or collaborating, etc. I'm just wondering how successful collaborative GMless Story Games have been at offering modes of play typical of GM focused RPGs. I hope this makes sense <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Anyway, if anyone knows of any games that do this successfully, I'd love to know about them; also, if anyone has any ideas on the matter, I would love to here them <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Thanks <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458122/#Comment_458122" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-16T09:58:29+00:00" title="November 16, 2016  9:58AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tentatively, there are games where collaborating toward achieving a pre-determined story arc trumps improvising, and all the improvising you do is in service of a known endpoint. Matthijs Holter's <i>Archipelago</i> is one such game: at the beginning of each session, a "destiny point" (a session endpoint, achieved goal or big twist) is written down for each protagonist character (through a semi-collaborative process) - play then consists of collaboratively maneuvering to achieve those discrete end states.<br/><br/>There are also "GMless" games where a number of players act in concert, creating and depicting a situation, a cast of characters, etc., all functional to seeing one individual main character through it.

It's not said out loud, but the one playing the samurai is basically a game master. It's a brilliant game too, and the printed book has tighter rules.<br/><br/><a href="https://kagematsu.wordpress.com/kagematsu-rules/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://kagematsu.wordpress.com/kagematsu-rules/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
