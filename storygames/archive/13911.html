Mailing a game by the post office is cheaper.<br/><br/>Another cost savings that amazon has is in cost of box. They are buying is bulk - hugh bulk so they can get boxes cheaper than small timers can.

I worked for a tool company for a while. And I've dealt with companies like Studio 2 and so on who do fulfillment for companies (as well as warehousing). The real break Amazon has over everyone else is dedicated UPS staff at their warehouse. And a hugely beneficial contract that keeps their UPS costs lower than yours or mine. UPS sends 10-20 people to the amazon warehouse where they work only on the Amazon account. Amazon packs the material themselves, but UPS ships it. Now, here's the kicker. Amazon doesn't have a retail front or even an R&amp;D division. So the warehouse costs are part of the business model of the company, meaning they don't charge you to pack the box the way a smaller company would have to charge you. They slap a sticker on it, send it down the line and the dedicated UPS staff throw the boxes directly into an 18-wheeler waiting right there in the warehouse. When it's about 3/4 full, they let UPS know and a new truck is sent over. UPS gets guaranteed work from Amazon and Amazon gets a reduced cost on shipping, much like McDonalds getting a better price on Coke.<br/><br/>Replace UPS with FedEx in this example if you like or whatever shipper a deep discounter works with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315382/#Comment_315382" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-03T18:17:08+00:00" title="March  3, 2011  6:17PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is where it'd be pretty handy if Kinkos offered a PoD store, so you could buy something from Kinkos instead of Lulu, and go to your nearest location and pick it up, with all transactions handled online.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315397/#Comment_315397" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-03T19:44:22+00:00" title="March  3, 2011  7:44PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim C Koppang</cite>Some of this may be the difference between First Class and Priority Mail.

Darren Watts (IPR) asked me to briefly comment on this. <br/>\n<br/>\nIPR uses X-Cart to run its website, and X-Cart uses information provided by the Postal Service, FedEx, and UPS to determine its pricing based on a formula that also calculates handling and packaging material fees. The later two costs are pretty minimal, and don't account for any discrepancies mentioned on this thread (such as $8 vs $30), but they do mean that it will probably always be at least slightly less expensive for an individual publisher to go to the post office and mail something than it will be for IPR to ship something. (In other words, we have some minimal expenses beyond the shipping fees.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is true that the postal service raised its international shipping rates on January first. First Class is (I believe) limited to weights of under 14 ounces, effectively removing it from being useful to us (IPR) in most circumstances, as we try to used backing &amp; packing material on even the smallest shipments. (Otherwise your books &amp; games arrive damaged more often.) Priority Flat Rate is my preferred method of International shipping to all foreign countries besides Canada &amp; Mexico, where FedEx and UPS are still practical.<br/>\n<br/>\nHOWEVER, we have had some problems with X-Cart in 2011, particularly with the USPS International portion of the software. And I didn't program the aforementioned formula into the system myself: that was done before DOJ bought IPR. (We haven't made any changes to it since we acquired IPR, though the Postal Service has changed its prices.) So here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to have a good, hard look at how the software determines international shipping costs and report back to you. If it's doing something funky, I will render it non-funky.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJason Walters, IPR General Manager                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darren%20Watts" title="Darren Watts"><img alt="Darren Watts" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darren%20Watts">Darren Watts</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315455/#Comment_315455" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T08:35:01+00:00" title="March  4, 2011  8:35AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2011 8:35AM by Darren Watts.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: Graham <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the key, I think.

It winds up costing me less than $10 a year to do that and it's worth it to have an s&amp;h charge that isn't all wonky, like "$6.12".</blockquote>\nJosh, which carrier, and what option?<br/><br/>We (by which, I mean my store, Modern Myths) always ship printed matter via Media Mail unless the buyer requests otherwise. It's half to a third the cost of Priority, and we've found it to be perfectly reliable. You can't get the same level of point-to-point tracking you can via UPS, but you CAN get Delivery Confirmation. We generally use a Flat Rate of $4 for most books because of this, and bump it a few bucks as weight goes up. As of our last shipment to the UK, I think the cutoff for First Class International was 4 lbs. I am 90% certain the domestic cutoff is much lower. If you happen to be a service-person reading this, rates to IPO boxes should be MUCH more reasonable.<br/><br/>For the folks who said that USPS is 'running into the ground', I gotta say there are few things I find more disingenuous than bashing the Post Office by comparing it to private enterprise. They have two major considerations that the private carriers don't need to deal with: any time they want to raise rates, they need o get permission from Congress, and they're required BY LAW to deliver to any legal address in the United States, including lots and lots and lots of places that UPS and FedEx simply refuse to go to. our Postal system is one of the genuine triumphs of American democracy, and seriously, it's one of the things that government really does right.<br/><br/>We can have a whole discussion about why Amazon not actually being a retailer but a stock scheme and data-mining operation being why they're able to so relentlessly obliterate the value of print, but any time I start on that, it turns into a rant. Suffice to say: Amazon simply operates by different rules, which include not actually making any (or much) money on the product they retail, unlike those of us who don't have a decade and hundreds of millions in venture capital to figure out our business model.<br/><br/>IPR is in a tough position: Media Mail is much cheaper, but has little in the way of tracking options, exposing them to significant charge-back risk. Keep in mind also that if you have someone like Josh charging a flat rate of six bucks, it might cost him $3 to ship one of his games 40 miles over the border to VT, but $9 to ship to the NW corner of Washington state, and six-ish to most of the Midwest and South, while IPR is rather compelled to charge exact rates plus that handling fee Darren mentioned, which makes it tough to do an apples-to-apples comparison. It's a reality of the biz that people who buy from my eBay store from NY are subsidizing shipping to Cali, but Josh is right that below a certain size, and within a certain range, a flat rate for all buyers is just easier to deal with.<br/><br/>Mainly, I don't want anyone to jump immediately to the conclusion that Darren, or indeed any retailer, is "ripping them off" based on rates from amazon or direct from a private individual shipper. It's a complicated issue and costs vary insanely depending on origin, destination, shipper, service, etc.<br/><br/>Finally, for what it's worth, it's pretty easy to figure out what shipping ought to cost using different methods, and it's probably something that I take for granted in assuming people have an idea how to do to protect themselves as consumers:<br/><br/>UPS has a handy <a href="https://wwwapps.ups.com/ctc/request?loc=en_US&amp;WT.svl=PNRO_L1" rel="nofollow">calculate time and cost</a> widget on their site you can use to back up b-board posts like I did on the Canada shipping question.<br/><br/>FedEx has a similar <a href="https://www.fedex.com/ratefinder/home?cc=US&amp;language=en&amp;locId=express" rel="nofollow">online rate and time calculator</a>.<br/><br/>The Postal Service <a href="http://www.usps.com/tools/calculatepostage/welcome.htm?from=home_header&amp;page=calculatepostage" rel="nofollow">has a smilar widget,</a>. Media Mail is listed under 'other options'. You can also download a somewhat outdated but still perfectly usable desktop program called '<a href="http://www.usps.com/shippingassistant/instructions.htm" rel="nofollow">Shipping Assistant</a>' that you can use to store addresses, print labels, and even do pre-paid postage; it's what we use at the shop and though it can be a bit clunky, it works as well as it needs to to get the job done (and is another rare example of why the USPS represents the government working as it should: when they announced the SA would be discontinued in favor of going all-online last year, the hue and cry caused them to reconsider and re-fund its continued operation!)<br/><br/>Anyway, I hope that's helpful to everyone. Please feel free to whisper to me if you're curious about my shop. I work very hard not to spam the list with talking about it, but am happy to discuss the ins and outs of the retail side of things with anyone who might be curious, on this issue or any other (including carrying some copies of your games to sell in-store, at our eBay store, and at several New England cons (/spam)).<br/><br/>-Jim C.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315539/#Comment_315539" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T23:40:28+00:00" title="March  4, 2011 11:40PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

Any other Priority package requires the larger customs form, which is then trackable (the smaller customs form does show up in the tracking system, but doesn't give any info other than that it's been put in the mail). I didn't realize this until an international customer kept asking me about tracking and I decided to try putting the customs form number in, and guess what, it told me where the package was (ended up hung up in customs at his end).<br><br>Frank                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
