Many of these<i> Player Characters</i> show an admirable restraint in the manner in which they deal with ordinary citizens. Sometimes, however, a misunderstanding may occur in which a harmless bystander suffers due to the thoughtless, though thoroughly well intentioned, actions of the <i>Player Characters</i>. Some of these unfortunate individuals are killed or maimed. Some are left financially or socially ruined.<br/><br/>Our primary role as the NSPCNPC is to prevent this suffering, through the use of an interlocutor. Our representatives have been trained to negotiate with the <i>Player Characters</i> to reassure them that certain acts are not necessary for the completion of their tasks. We also have a large team of medics and counsellors, who attempt to mitigate any lasting damage.<br/><br/>We already have the support from a large number of GMs, but we desperately need funds to carry on our good work. Please donate generously.<br/><br/>Here follow some affidavits from people who have benefited from our work.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20M" title="Andrew M"><img alt="Andrew M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20M">Andrew M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204588/#Comment_204588" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T19:30:20+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  7:30PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2009 7:31PM by Andrew M.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Stumpy" the one legged burglar had some info. which was of vital importance to a group of PC's.

I belong to this school of GMing called F\xfchl\xf8vschn\xe0pz that endorse a program of hyper realit\xe0t raoul playing where the GM is supposed to represent society accurately in his choice of NPCs. For instance I often mentioned (what we call in oligo-ethnology reactionary phonem) "the idiot of the village". In my view NPCs should be given the chance to see life through the eyes of every politically correct stereotype that they wish too. Oh believe me, I had volunteers ! My players were atrocious to poor dumb Nick. Repeatedly. I regret so much I was an accomplice of these abuses. I cried and I cried. And I decided to change with the help of The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Non-Player Characters. I started serving oysters, champagne and rape pills to my players. Soon enough they were fornicating like rabbits and completely forgot about poor little Nicky who by this time had a prominent boner. <br/><br/>Thank you NSPCNPC, you bring back dignity to a hobby gone apeshit...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204693/#Comment_204693" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T08:15:28+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  8:15AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2009 10:22AM by David Artman.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was a wreck, a shambles... nerves shot, I tell ya! Without the kind ministry of the NSPCNPC, I couldn't even tell you this horror story without a belly full of the hard stuff and a half yard of linen for snottin' on.<br/><br/>Me and me lads were just having a piss-up 'round the pub, when in walks this weird group of richies and their hulking bodyguard. Never seen such armor and fine, shining steel. --And who wears armor to the pub, anyway? But I digress....<br/><br/>So's anyway, the tart of the group--a fine-enough looking wench dressed like she's planning to work upstairs at the Speckled Hen, if ya ken--sidles up and asks me and the lads if we'd like a bit of work for a few days. Yeah, right, we'll "work" for ya--nudge, nudge. The bodyguard didn't much take to our little jokes, and we were about to tell 'em all to sod off, but this skinny, shifty-eyed bloke in the group drops a heavy looking sack of dosh onna table and tells us to be ready to leave at dawn. Fair enough--we could drink until dawn, easily; done it most week's ends.<br/><br/>And so it's now dawn, we're a bit the worse for drink but can still shift the packs we're given to haul, and the group leads us up into the hills. And then into a bloody cave--no, really, they did, I'm not takin' the piss! We din' even know there was caves in the hills, 'cause most good folk know better than to muck about up there, what with the wolves and bears and such. But, hey, we'd drank half our pay already, so it wasn't like we could pay these barmy blokes back and leave! And the bodyguard woulda likely skewered us on his improbably sized sword, if'n we'd just tried runnin' off. SO... Some torches, a bit of roping together, and we become speelunkers.<br/><br/>That when the first horror struck--some fell beast or such, like we'd never seen... and poor Barney--the fella with the big jowls and rheumy eyes that used to live over west?--that's when he was took. Split right in two, like a sausage for pan-frying, and there's blood all over everyfing. I was set for quittin' right then, but the beady-eyed bastard what paid us starts waving around a nasty little pig-sticker, and it seems we're in for the long haul. But, hey, at least our shares in the pay had just gone up! Gotta find the silver lining, not to pun ya.<br/><br/>It never got any better after that, though. Freddie the Fisher was told to open an odd-looking door--don't ask me why there's a bloody fooking DOOR in some old caves!--and he lets out this sort of soft sigh and just slumps to the ground, deader'n last years Christmas goose. Turns out some right bastard had hid some kinda thorn or some-such, with a narsty poison onnit, behind the door pull... and it was Freddie's day in the barrel, like they say.<br/><br/>Should I go on to recount, in gory detail, how Stew was disemboweled by some kinda bear with the head of a fookin' BIRD? Or how Little Mark was made to lead the way down a corridor and got pin-cushioned by bleedin' arrows flying outta the damned WALLS?! Or Frank from Bogend being crushed under a cave-in when he was told to poke and prod at some squiggle-marked wall with a stave?<br/><br/>I still hear their screams, though I can at least sleep through the night, now, thanks to the NSPCNPC. But I don't think I'll EVER get over the fact that the bastard "adventurers" raked in a haul of lucre enough to feed a family of ten for 50 years, were lauded as heroes by the smallfolk back in town, and ended up shagging every virgin left in the county! It's a bad world, I reckon; and the worser the crew, the better their lot. Here we'd lost six of our stoutest lads--all with families to feed and plots to work--and I'd've been left in that pit with them if I hadn't been just a wee bit lighter on my feet than Little Mark. Want to see my "share" of the take...? Here, take a long look at the right arm I ain't got anymore!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204703/#Comment_204703" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T08:37:06+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  8:37AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once, I had pie.<br/><br/>Now, no pie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204719/#Comment_204719" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T09:02:42+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  9:02AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My name is Clancy Wolf.

I give him food and we talk for a while. He seems unusually well-educated and I grow to like him. Since I am Lawful Good, I offer him a bath and a change of clothes. The next thing I know, we are in bed together.<br/><br/>The next morning, I am surprised at what I have done, but happy, too, because he seemed like a nice gentleman. However, later, someone tells me that the beggar only slept with me to settle an argument over whether Charisma was more important than Comeliness.<br/><br/>Fortunately, one of my friends pointed me towards the NSPCNPC.

[not real name] Kneel before me and beg that I might merely make you a slave!<br/><br/>Before the NSPCNPC, my glorious fortress was incessantly broken into, pillaged, and sometimes even woefully damaged by thrill-seeking, greedy miscreants! Swine in clattering armor and crackling robes! Sure, some would profess being begged to assault my property and person because of... minor disagreements with some of my neighbors in the village in the vale. But who are these foreigners to dictate terms to Hallal?!? Who are they to meddle in mere internal politics and issues of proper sacrifice schedules, availability of virgins, and eminent domain?<br/><br/>Well, as it turns out, they're foreigners with extensive resources, rather advanced educations, and apparently some contacts with deities. Err, that is, deities LESSER THAN I, THE ALL-DEVOURER!!!<br/><br/>And, so, unbelievable as it may seem, I was made to suffer discorporation and the painful and time-consuming degradation of finding a new vic--um, assistant--to enjoy the hospitality of their mortal form. I treat such host forms quite well--after all, su casa me casa, no?--and I even entertain petitions from what's left of their minds, every fourth full moon. It's an amenable relationship to all concerned: I live, they don't get devoured.<br/><br/>Then I must make my way back to my desmense, COMPLETELY restaff, effect repairs to my walls and internal security measures... the costs are atrocious, and an All-Devourer KNOWS what that word means. Just for another pack of interlopers to muck it all up again!<br/><br/>But all that ended when I joined the NSPCNPC. Their attorneys have issued restraining orders on the local villagers and sued the village's mayor for slander and libel, which provided me with a timely leg-up on expanding my labor base to better-patrol the grounds surrounding my fell keep. And should yet-another wayward party of murderous ideologues come around, the NSPCNPC provides temp solutions for a variety of pest-repellent professions.<br/><br/>My home has never been safer, nor more peaceful.

At least, I did (sniffle)...<br/><br/>I knew it was a danger, running a tavern and inn in a small, but Ork-plagued town, but I had a wife and a once-maidenly daughter who helped me run the place and all seemed to be happy for our family.  That was, of course until those people came in, smelling of adventure and glowing with that soft PC aura that makes them cling to each other no matter how unalike they would be if they were like the rest of us.<br/><br/>At first, they were good customers.  They had goodly amounts of coin, and were ready to spend it to buy mead, meals, and rooms for the night.  Their attentions to my daughter were unwelcome, but she is her own woman now, I suppose and she knew how to handle herself with teamsters and the like.  Little did I know she was not immune to something called "charm person", but I will not drag her woes into this when my own are more than enough....<br/><br/>Things took a turn for the worst when that dreadful man slumped his way into my establishment.  He was bleeding something awful from a dagger wound to the back and he stumbled to their table and slumped onto it, handing them a map and whispering something to them with his last breath.  At that moment, the City Guard burst in, obviously chasing this criminal to the scene.<br/><br/>When the self-styled "Company of the Iron Groat" stood up to meet the Guardsmen with weapons and spells, I was flabbergasted.  The carnage that erupted after that cost me my wife, my arm, and a good quarter of my business (not mention what was happening to my daughter elsewhere with their so-called "security specialist" and his vile [but, I am told, charming] scroll).<br/><br/>As they left their handiwork behind, and as I drifted into unconsciousness, I heard one of them comment how much he liked "a good bar fight" after an adventure! <br/><br/>The NSPCNPC came in and helped out.  They brought in relief to help me rebuild the burned sections of the tavern, clerics to bury my wife, and they have even aided in removing the birthmark from my new grandson that surely would have marked him for some shady destiny.  They hope to prevent any manifestation of the "PC aura" I now know so well.  By lying to him and hiding his origins (and the amulet his dead-beat dad left behind), we hope we can safeguard him from future misery.<br/><br/>With the aid of the NSPCNPC, I know we can do it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
