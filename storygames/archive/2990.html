Did the whole 6 hours in two sittings, and it certainly had Krause (and I got over feeling like I was watching Nate Fischer, Police Detective) and it certainly bore a relation to <cite>Earthquake Weather</cite> and the Cardboard Palace.  What it had that I didn't like so much, but that on reflection strikes me as very interesting is this: it's all about exploring the sci-fi premise of this weird pocket dimensiony thing and the consequences of it's existence.<br/><br/>Trying not to spoil the whole thing for others, but the idea is that there's this motel key, that will open any door with a pin-and-tumbler lock, and the door will open into a motel room, circa 1960.  Upon leaving, if you fix a door in your mind, it'll open onto that door.  Neat, very powerful little modern-magic item.  And there's a bunch of everyday objects that originate in the room that are somehow promoted to being Objects, each with their own power and with unpredictable interactions.  Oh, and there's this little feature that if you leave the room and come back, it's restored to exactly it's original state, and anything that's not an Object (like, say, your 8 year old daughter) disappears.<br/><br/>There's all kinds of internally consistent consequences that the miniseries expounds on.  Watching it, I got this feeling I'd only ever gotten from Joss Whedon TV: that I was watching someone else's (edited) role playing transcripts, complete with planning/doing cycles, and ad hoc terminology applied once and rigorously maintained.  <cite>The Lost Room</cite> even ends on this weird, shaky conclusion, like the GM was reaching to wrap things up for a particular session.<br/><br/>And, much as I usually hate to compare role play to other media, I'm sort of thinking that that weird feeling is the realization that <cite>The Lost Room,</cite> and <cite>Firefly</cite> (and <cite>Buffy</cite> for that matter) are simulationist shows.  There's a creative agenda there, and it's about exploring the setting (in the case of <cite>Lost Room</cite>) or character (in the case of Joss Whedon's stuff.)  <br/><br/>So I wonder, if that's a legitimate observation, can we glean anything from it towards actually supporting Sim?  Or, by contrast with almost all other fiction, towards supporting Nar better?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68145/#Comment_68145" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T18:04:48+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  6:04PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think you can really map creative agendas to a passive medium.

If you like, weaken my observation to an analogy: Sim : Nar :: Lost Room : BSG.  Or something.  Do you see the point I'm trying to make or not?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andrew Morris</cite>It's interesting that you found the focus to be on the setting, Judson. Myself, I saw it and thought, "Oh, so it's really not about magic items or sci-fi, it's a standard hero's journey."</blockquote>\nOne of the key elements that really struck me hard was the fact that the characters start referring to "resets" - i.e. the way the room was always the same, regardless of how much you changed it.  I thought there was some hero's journey action there as ligament to hold what would otherwise be setting exposition together as a story.  That and the Clock heist.  Or "how do I find Wally?  Go to Gallup and wait for someone to fall out of the sky."<br><br>Ask yourself: which do you know more about after having watched <cite>The Lost Room:</cite> the Room, the Objects, etc, or Joe Miller?  I mean, you can write and RPG based on the setting as a consequence of watching the show, right?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68154/#Comment_68154" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T18:31:47+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  6:31PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Mike, I think Judson means the CAs of the creators.</blockquote>\nYeah.
