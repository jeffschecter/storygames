It's only happened once so far, but it was a huge success--12ish people, I believe, with some new gamers coming in that has bled into some of Play Out Loud's other public gaming events.<br/><br/>These events are run by the amazing Hannah V., but I don't think she's on Story-Games. If I get any comments from her I'll let you know.<br/><br/>What do you all think of this idea? I'm pretty damn excited that it's something we're doing; on the one hand gender division, etc., but on the other hand--let's face it, these games are by and large a boys' club, and a white boys' club at that. This has been something that has so far been successful at broadening our demographic, and making a safe space for folks who may not have felt safe or comfortable walking into a game store meetup probably filled with strange men.<br/><br/>Anyone else done this thing, on a public scale? Any success? Any failures?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399787/#Comment_399787" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-06T08:14:41+00:00" title="December  6, 2012  8:14AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://jentecon.wordpress.com/info-in-english" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://jentecon.wordpress.com/info-in-english</a><br/><br/><a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ffemcon.sverok.net%2F&amp;act=url" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;js=n&amp;amp;prev=_t&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;eotf=1&amp;amp;u=http://femcon.sverok.net/&amp;amp;act=url</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hannah" title="Hannah"><img alt="Hannah" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hannah">Hannah</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400820/#Comment_400820" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T10:17:16+00:00" title="December 14, 2012 10:17AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey look, it's me! Thanks for the kudos, Hans!!! We've had two Ladies' Nights so far, and it's going to continue as a monthly event. The lovely Fi will be taking over in Portland, since I'm now in Seattle. I haven't had a chance to get hooked into the Seattle story game community yet, but assuming there's a need (wouldn't it be great if there weren't?), and assuming I end up staying in Seattle for a bit, I might try to get a similar event started here. <br/><br/>At the first Ladies' Night in November, 12 ladies attended, many of whom were new to story games or to RPGs all together. At least one of those former-newbies has now become a regular at other Play Out Loud events, and has started offering advice and encouragement to other new people checking out the group's events. One of my goals is to offer games by female designers on at least a fairly regular basis. On this occasion, we featured Psi*Run by Meguey Baker, alongside The Dreaming Crucible and Monster Hearts. <br/><br/>The second Ladies' Night, which happened just this past Tuesday, was slightly less well-attended, but I attribute that to the holidays, gross weather, etc. We had six lovely ladies in attendance, four of which were completely new to story games. We were going to play One Thousand and One Nights, but ended up playing Fiasco because it's just such a great gateway drug. Everyone had an awesome, hilarious, riotous time. As we wrapped up the evening, all five of the women who had joined me there agreed that they would attend the next Play Out Loud event.<br/><br/>Story games are all about sharing ideas, blending our perspectives together to create something beautiful, hilarious, challenging, and/or downright awesome. The art and culture of story games can only benefit by opening its arms to as diverse an audience as possible. Ladies' Night is a safe space for people who represent gender minorities within the gaming community. Hopefully, it will catch on in other areas. Events like this can act as a gateway, ultimately leading to a more even gender balance within this community as a whole.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400833/#Comment_400833" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T11:17:21+00:00" title="December 14, 2012 11:17AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sad that there's a need for this sort of thing but extremely grateful that people have risen to meet that need.<br/><br/>Someday I'm confident we'll be one big all-inclusive happy family, but until that day, cheers to people like Hannah for being excellent stewards.

They've done a good job of creating a welcoming environment, one that attracts/supports lots of women and new gamers. Saturday's events are hosted by a lady (a great one, named Caroline), though they aren't lady-exclusive events like the ones you've been running in Portland.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.geekgirlcon.com/" rel="nofollow">Geek Girl Con</a> is an annual convention that celebrates women geeks (and girl geeks). It's not a women-only space either, but the men and boys who are there are there as allies and enthusiastic supporters.<br/><br/>I know of at least 2-3 all-women gaming groups in Seattle, though it'd be weird to share their info here.
