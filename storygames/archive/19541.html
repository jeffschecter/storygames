My latest project is a synthesis of my two passions: 1) traditional Japanese art forms, and 2) Japan-themed roleplaying games. I'm teaming up with two other artists to create <i>A Land of Narrow Paths</i>. We're creating illustrative, comprehensive maps of Edo period Japan (~1603-1868), as well as an accompanying setting booklet that details the time period. The maps are made with a combination of traditional Japanese techniques and digital formatting processes. They come in two forms: historical or folkloric. The folkloric version will feature illustrations of yokai surrounding their most representative regions.<br/><br/>This project is perfect for Japan enthusiasts -- especially fans of Usagi Yojimbo, Samurai Champloo, Baian the Assassin, Mushishi, Miyamoto Musashi, Lone Wolf and Cub, Vagabond, and so on. Our goals are to immerse backers in the Edo period, highlight the era's culture of wandering and its associated wanderers, and generate interest in traditional Japanese art forms. Wanderlust and folklore are thus two central themes of our work.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nicholascladis/a-land-of-narrow-paths" rel="nofollow"><b>Here is the link to our Kickstarter project.</b></a> We were selected as a staff pick and are currently at almost 300% of our funding goal. This means we're introducing stretch goals that upgrade or add to our content, but remain firmly within our schedule.<br/><br/>Speaking of that, backers recently unlocked an awesome stretch goal: our very own deck of <i>obake karuta</i>, or "monster cards". We're scanning our hand-drawn illustrations (made with sumi ink and Japanese watercolor pigments) and putting them onto cards. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nicholascladis/a-land-of-narrow-paths/posts/886921" rel="nofollow">You can read more about <i>obake karuta</i> here.</a> It's a simple, spooky card game invented during the Edo period.<br/><br/>While <i>A Land of Narrow Paths</i> is technically an art project, all of us come from gaming backgrounds, and we feel that these products would make fantastic supplements for Japan-themed RPGs.<br/><br/>Thanks for taking a look!
