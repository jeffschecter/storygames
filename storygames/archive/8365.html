I really need to revise the Push section of the Bleeding Play site, to more prominently feature links to the PDF, but I've just had other priorities lately.  Once I do that, Push 1 will actually be back up on Lulu, so that folks can buy print copies at cost, so it's totally cool that you went ahead and did that, Hans.<br/><br/>Push 2 may still happen, probably just including the material that's already been written.  But that means I have to actually get around to editing it and so far I've been a total flake, much to the detriment of everyone who's written stuff for it (apologies!).  I have the bad habit of committing to far more than I can actually accomplish, which has left more than a few projects lying by the wayside, but my resolution for the New Year involves resolving more of my unfinished business.<br/><br/>After Push 2, I'm not sure if Push has a definite future, but we'll see.  I still feel that there is a definite need to be served there, but, as Matt figured out with Daedalus, running a journal or zine takes a lot more work than one would expect.  Honestly, I think moving to an electronic, HTML format (as opposed to print or PDF) -- more like a group blog -- might make that easier and limit the amount of editing / layout that was necessary, streamlining the goal of getting content to an audience.  But I'm just speculating at this point.  Maybe folks could guest-contribute articles to Bleeding Play?  Not sure.

Perhaps simply having a blog and then asking interesting people to write blog posts for it on an individual basis would serve your style better. Something like Wordpress easily allows you to do a revision cycle as well as keeping yourself as the main editor. This approach would cost in terms of media profile visibility, but I don't know that you'd care about that so much - and it'd certainly be a more lightweight structure compared to how you've been going about it 'till now. And it's not difficult to compile blog material for a higher-profile publication such as a pdf 'zine later if you feel like doing something of the sort.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, much of the interest for Push has been fed by the choice of medium, so I don't know how many people would even notice the same or similar content when offered in a low-profile medium like a blog. So it's a choice between visibility and convenience. Considering that you already chose to make the project free, it'd seem logical to complete the move towards low-barrier, low-profile publishing by opting for the blog. Or heck, you could opt for "blogs" - instead of having your own blog and editing other people's writing for it, tell people to write interesting articles at their own blogs like it was your business to do so <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185007/#Comment_185007" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-27T07:06:52+00:00" title="December 27, 2008  7:06AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha. Well, I could see Push working as a, uh, blog aggregator with power.  That is, I could just go about my business, reading blog articles and whatnot, and then, when I found something I thought was really cool, I could see if the author wanted to revise and expand that idea into something a bit more formal, which could then be combined with other similar articles, commented on in the manner of the marginal commentary in Push 1, and then thrown up on Lulu to sell for cost.  That would cut out the draft phase entirely, because it would be based on already written material.  And I would probably cut the amount of editing I did way down, letting the author's work stand on its own more, for better or worse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185011/#Comment_185011" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-27T07:50:33+00:00" title="December 27, 2008  7:50AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the idea of Push as a blog with Jonathan as the editor - asking people to write about certain subjects, and helping them form/finish their articles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185012/#Comment_185012" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-27T07:53:18+00:00" title="December 27, 2008  7:53AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Where is the download link on the site?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185014/#Comment_185014" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-27T07:57:58+00:00" title="December 27, 2008  7:57AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Currently, it's hidden in the top right corner of the individual articles from Push 1 (such as <a href="http://bleedingplay.wordpress.com/push/collaborative-roleplaying/" rel="nofollow">this one</a>).

While I'll be reading whatever comes out of PUSH whether in print or online, there is a certain quality to it once it hits print that it doesn't have online. For one, it's more tangible and archival. Maybe this isn't true, but anything on the web feels extremely ephemeral to me, web.archive.org notwithstanding. Having PUSH in my hands is like having an academic journal about roleplaying, which is extremely cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185377/#Comment_185377" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T17:37:16+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  5:37PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wish we had a real academic journal, Hans.  <a href="http://edugamesblog.wordpress.com/2007/11/21/cfp-inaugral-issue-of-ijrp/" rel="nofollow">The IJRP idea</a> was a great one, but that project seems to have faded off the face of the earth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185411/#Comment_185411" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-31T03:27:51+00:00" title="December 31, 2008  3:27AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WRT academic journals: Some editors of (and contributors to) the Knutepunkt/Solmukohta books want those books to be academic journals.
