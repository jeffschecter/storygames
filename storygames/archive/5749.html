This isn't me saying, "Its a good game if you ahve the right players," but it is me saying that gamers need some skills to be good at what we do.<br/><br/>Other thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128593/#Comment_128593" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T10:53:30+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 10:53AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it depends on the items on the list, and the specific role of the game and the players. <br/><br/>Like, say, scene framing. I do love games that let me scene frame well -- that have natural break points, good flags to frame to, descriptive elements about character or setting or whatever. (Say, PTA's custom locations, or the way Afraid gets you to pause when someone escalates.)<br/><br/>However, there is still an art to scene framing -- its a thing that you do with your group to hit the note, the tone, the pace, and the tension your group likes. Any time mechanics try to too rigorously frame a scene for you, rather than helping you do it yourself, you risk blowing over what the group wants. (As one of our players said it once when we were playtesting a game with too many scene framing rules for us "I wish the game would stop stepping on my dick.") <br/><br/>In general I want a game that helps, provokes, and maybe (maybe) even guides -- but a game that negates the need for player skills seems to be a game designed to negate players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128612/#Comment_128612" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T11:24:40+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 11:24AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We could debate the point, but I'd really love it if this thread helped me figure out what things in what systems helped grease the wheels for particular skills.<br/><br/>i.e.<br/><br/>Wicked Age's setup phase helps me craft situations.<br/>Aspects in FATE help GMs use bangs from the player's sheet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128776/#Comment_128776" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T14:37:47+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  2:37PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2008 2:43PM by cydmab.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me list a few examples I had in mind:<br/>\n<br/>\nPolaris, by having different roles with different levels of intensity and story influence and rotating them, mostly "solved" the problem of sharing scene time for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nDitV, by having very specific protocols for generating towns and when to invoke mechanics (to escalate!) partly "solved" efficient time allocation while prepping an interesting game world and the skill of choosing when to oppose players and when to just go along<br/>\n<br/>\nDnD4 versus DnD3 hypothetically will reduce the need for the GM to have great skill and experience at designing challenging encounters for the players to face<br/>\n<br/>\nedit: to clarify what I had in mind, is that some of the things we think of as skills needed to have a good game are just patches to solve a problem that could of been fixed by the system, but isn't either because a) poor design b) we haven't invented a way to fix it yet c) it can't be fixed because it conflicts with some other design goal or d) we don't want to fix it, because flexing our skills is part of what makes a game fun for some people.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I used to think the ability to actively regulate scene time among the players was an essential GM skill. Then I tried Polaris, and realized it was (in my view) a headache that could be basically circumvented by using a different system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128824/#Comment_128824" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T17:26:22+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  5:26PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm finding myself a little torn on this topic.<br><br>I mean, yeah, some games help us do stuff we would otherwise need "skill" for.
