                    This is a child of (at least) three threads, which lead to its three questions.<br/><br/>1. An old thread about <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=536" rel="nofollow">alternative possible origins of RPGs</a> - what if RPGs had arisen, not from miniatures wargaming, but from therapeutic roleplaying, or improv theatre, or... So this is question 1: What might RPGs look like if they had arisen from religious ritual?<br/><br/>(After all, there is a lot of roleplaying in religious ritual - priests roleplaying the gods, and so forth. In fact, this is one of the reasons the Catholic powers-that-be give for not allowing women priests: The priest represents Christ, who is male. The College of Cardinals obviously need to play more RPGs.)<br/><br/>2. Luke's "<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1118" rel="nofollow">System as Trance</a>" thread. I can't find it in the thread, but somehow connected with that thread in my mind is a suggestion from someone of using an RPG as a coming-of-age ritual. That would so rock. In fact, my ignorance of the details of the two games, and therefore the reasons that it isn't possible, leads me to propose: The Prince's Kingdom played in a different way, where when a prince reaches age 13 or whatever it is he/she doesn't retire from the game but transitions into using full Dogs in the Vineyard rules.<br/><br/>So, question 2: How could we use the tools of RPGs, and RPGs themselves, to act as effective rituals - by which I mean experiences which enable the participants' sense of selfhood to shift, or be reinforced, in a significant manner?<br/><br/>3. The <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1073" rel="nofollow">Opening/Closing Ritual Roundup</a> thread, which gives me question 3: Can anyone report instances where this has already happened?<br/><br/>Feel free to answer any or all of the questions in your posts.                </div>

                            Crazy. These "alternate development" thought paths seem to have a lot of parallel development happening.<br/>
<br/>
Meaning that last night I was braining out the basics for a two-version rpg focusing around a rite-of-passage/shamanistic testing ritual. Much of the basis is walking in the spirit world, learning the symbols of things there, and how to solve problems with spirits, as it "happens differently" with spirits than it does with men.  One mode of the game is the "practice session" played by the children who have not gone through the rite. The second mode is how that initial play has been adapted into modern practice.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if it's been said before, but the ability to play roles is somewhat of a coming-of-age marker. The ability to take a perspective outside your own, be initially objective, is certainly a skill that we are not born with. I do not know enough to speak of Prince's Kingdom, although I am trying to find out more.                        </div>

                            I seem to remember at last year's Gencon there was a group called Gameloft or something similar who had a club that helped kids deal with growing up through the medium of roleplaying. Not sure if they have a site but Morgue went to see them and said they were right on the ball.<br/>

                            This particular iteration of the games-from-alternate-sources kind of makes my skin crawl.  If you were to create such a game "for kicks" and all, you'd need to construct or adopt an entire dogmatic background from which to build the ritual/game, and build the ritual/game to reinforce that dogma.  This sounds disturbingly similar to the disturbing GMs who believe they're "teaching" their players things through the game.  Roleplaying is an incredible and powerful pedagogical tool.  This is straying very close to dangerous territory all in the name of idle speculation.<br/><br/>I can see two ways to sidestep the spookiness, here: (a) adopt a totally alien dogma from which to work -- say, Zoroastrianism -- in order to experiment and see what you come up with; the alien nature of the dogma would be part of the exploratory nature of the game.  Alternately, you could (b) frame the dogmatic ritual as something that <em>other people</em> do and the players happen upon it -- I can imagine a very viable frame of Victorian-era explorers "experimenting" with the traditions of some far-flung tribe they encounter in an expedition.  This set up allows the players some distance from the ritual-game-experience, and an easy "escape hatch" out if necessary.<br/><br/>In one last fit of clarification, this is exactly what <em>Dogs in the Vineyard</em> looks like but isn't.  When you first pitch Dogs to people, they look at you funny because they don't understand why you'd want to be a paladin representative of a misogynistic, oppressive society.  The thing is, in Actual Play, it's more about issues and questions that are important to you the player.  In this ritual-game thing we're talking about here, though, there is no such caveat -- play of such a ritual-game would reinforce the dogma.  And that's spooky.                        </div>

                            Point well taken, Joshua: If RPGs had evolved from rituals - the official rituals of official religions - they'd probably be used oppressively. (Regardless of the specific religion, this is true.)<br/><br/>However, I'm also interested in non-oppressive uses of ritual, in which the participants are not having a dogma enforced on them but are reinforcing the things that matter to them. And I think starting with the indy games we have, which already have mechanisms to bring out the things that matter to the players, is a good way forward to non-oppressive ritual.                        </div>

                            Hmmm. As far as I'm aware (and since I did a Certificate in Celebrant Studies last year, you'd think I would have heard), constructing rituals is so much more art than science that it would be hard to come up with rules. <br/><br/>On the other hand, we have all these good RPG/storygame tools about collaborative creation, drawing out what people care about, using and combining resources....<br/><br/>Hmmmmmmm.                        </div>

                            Q. 1.<br/>First off, I don't have a problem with religious roleplaying--I rarely find it oppressive and controlling.  It is, however, designed to work for people who have deep affective connections to the symbolic network deployed in the ritual.  If you don't have those connections, well, the ritual tends to fall flat.  Or, as I recently experienced, the ritual only has flashes of meaning for you.<br/><br/>That being said, I think there is some whackiness in talk about roleplaying *games* emerging from those traditions.  For the very reason that those involved in a religious ritual will have deep affective commitments, the notion of a game is antithetical to it.  At least, game as we use it in a colloquial, let's have some fun sense.  And a roleplaying ritual that falls far enough away from the core to become a roleplaying game, well, is actually counter-religious, undermining the uniqueness of the religious setting.  <br/><br/>It is, if you will, a counter-movement to organized religious structures.  I sort of imagine this *what if* scenario with scary questions of heresy, schism, and so on.  Sort of a hardcore protestantism (in the classic, you don't need clergy to tell you what God wants--you can figure that out yourself).  Of course, no dice, no regalia--all about shared guided visualization, perhaps with a touch of the 'Midrash' style mode of interpretation (what happened between these two stories?   Let's meditate upon it, brother--you tell me what you think he did next...).  In turn, with a still more radical branch pushing toward a right-proper enlightenment game, where the ritual devolves into theater...oh, wait, this actually sounds a little familiar.  Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy, anyone?                        </div>

<i>isbo, games aren't always for fun.</i><br/><br/>You sort of missed my point--we don't need an alternative history for rpg's that came out of ritual because we already have them.  Theater, improv, bdsm, therapy?  All have real, historical connections to ritual and religion.  All are different sorts of games employing ritual elements (largely with the religious component almost invisible) in a roleplaying, game-ish (let's play with, explore the connections between roles) setting.<br/><br/>What if rpgs developed out of...?  The assumption here still seems to be that the final rpg looks a lot like what we call rpg's (dice, tables, etc.) when those alternative threads might look nothing like it--so much so that we may already be in the midst of them and not see them.<br/><br/>And, as an aside, do we have reason for believing Senet wasn't fun?  Plenty of fun games carry an underlying 'serious' point--but that doesn't make them ritual.  There is a tendency when looking back at the archaeological record to give it a more spiritual and ritualistic dimension than it actually possessed.  Any reason not to think that this is just a game modeled on a very well-known symbolic structure?                        </div>

                            Dude, Snakes and Ladders.  Fun (for kids), but highly moral and pedagogical.<br/><br/>But I find Isbo's other point to be intriguing, and I'll spin it out further to where I'm standing.  It goes like this: religion is a system by which common answers are distributed amongst a diverse population.  Everybody wants to know why bad things happen in the world (the Problem of Evil), and so religion gives its believers an answer -- in fact, as far as the religion is concerned, it gives its believers <em>the</em> answer.  Roleplaying, by contrast, is exploratory and innovative.  It does not give players an answer, it challenges players to create an answer.  As such, it seems to me that the foundation of roleplaying is categorically at odds with the goals of religion.<br/><br/>So while I think game-as-ritual is a very intriguing thing to explore (and I think we already do it more than we think, and are deeper in it than we think), overlaying religious overtones to it or postulating religious pedigree turns the whole thing inside-out in ways that destroy the roleplaying in the name of reinventing it.                        </div>

<i>There's a difference between something being FOR fun, and something being fun.</i> <br/><br/>Ok, true, but that distinction doesn't change the content of what I have said or asked.  I'll gladly substitute 'wasn't fun' with 'wasn't played for fun,' 'fun games' with 'for fun games.'  It's a touch more rigorous, but is clearly identical with the gist of the whole question (namely, might this not just have been for fun?).  <br/><br/>In case my tone is ambiguous, I'm not trying to ask this in a rhetorical, I'm a smart jackass way--I'm actually just asking if the evidence we have for this statement about Senet being ritual.  Is it a robust, descriptions of holy games in hieroglyphics, for example?  Is it based just on comparisons between afterlife myths and the board?   Something else?  If you are merely citing someone else, I'm glad to just get a "oh, look at what X says about this."<br/><br/>To try to show my train of thought: Senet could be an interesting case study for showing this break between ritual and game, where you have a ritual component disappear until only the game remains.  It could also be an interesting case of how some games are just games, with a light 'color' of religious ethics tossed on top.  It could also be interesting if we consider how such a game could have had *roleplaying* components--speculative reverse engineering, if you will.  Which gets me back to my whole point about looking where there may already *be* alternative roleplaying histories.                        </div>

                            Isbo, there's very little we know about the game we call Senet.  We have no rules, just some vague images of people with their hands hovering over a board with cones and disks on it, and sticks nearby that might have been a randomizer.  We have some game boards, we have some pieces, and that's about it.  How much of the rules of Cribbage could you deduce from the tools and a few images of people playing?  <br/><br/>That being said, the images we have of Senet change through history.  In the early periods, people are shown playing against other people.  In later eras, they are shown playing against gods.  That's about as much evidence as archaeologists ever have to go by, and from it they have surmised that late-era Senet had religious themes.                        </div>

                            I'm actually all for the idea of RPG = "Cult" if the game/scenarios are actually designed intentionally to push a certain POV, and this is made explicit. That is, not trying to trick anyone into playing, but just pedagogical for those people who want the lessons of the religion in question. <br/><br/>In fact, it's already been done, in theory with a number of Christian RPGs like this: <a href="http://www.holylands.net/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.holylands.net/</a><br/><br/>Now, I'm willing to bet that very few or even none of these has the sort of Forge-esqe chops to actually make it a truely pedagogical game. But the intent is certainly there. <br/><br/>What's the downside here? For those looking for something like this?<br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            Yes, that's an excellent book, and I'd recommend it too. Funny, moving, sensible, grounded.<br/><br/>It's interesting (and useful) to me to see that various people - presumably through their own exposure to ritual and religion - have quite a different response to the idea of "ritual" than I do. That is, they see it as probably oppressive and/or pedagogical. This reminds me of the work I need to do in reorienting people's thinking (or using different labels) if I want to create games, etc. in this space.<br/><br/>A reminder of something which perhaps got overlooked in my original post because that post is long and it's near the bottom: I am defining "rituals" as "experiences which enable the participants' sense of selfhood to shift, or be reinforced, in a significant manner".<br/><br/>Not their adherence to or belief in a religious dogma.<br/><br/>I could rant on about how western Protestantism has screwed everyone up by making "adherence to or belief in a dogma" the key issue in this space and tossing transformation to one side, but I won't. <br/><br/>Oh, I just did. Sorry about that, Chief.                        </div>
