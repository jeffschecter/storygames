I've seen Zorcerer of Zo several times and it has caught my interest and people have told me it is cool but couldn't tell me why and didn't seem to have played it themselves and didn't know how to demo it. When I see your posts, I think "I really like your handle, your avatar, and your posts seem upbeat and friendly." But I've never associated you with Zorcerer of Zo or any other specific games. <br/><br/>The following apply to me:<br/><br/>C. I need to play a demo first. (demos rock!)<br/>D. I've never met you in person. (I tend to buy most of my friend's games)<br/>H. You don't design in the open enough. (this always catches my eye)<br/>N. Who are you again? (in the sense that I don't associate you with these games)<br/>V. You didn't buy my game. (I don't have a game or anything for sale but I imagine if you bought said fictional product and said nice things about it, I would definitely make an effort to return the positivity in your direction)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92586/#Comment_92586" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T10:41:19+00:00" title="September  2, 2007 10:41AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2007 2:06PM by Graham.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            C.

When examined in a world where hundreds of free games like Risus exist that can do <i>everything</i> that PDQ does with comparable flair, paying $20 to $30 may be a hard sell for many people. It is for me. <br/><br/>Now, having said that, I did buy <i>Questers of the Middle Realms</i> and its accompanying bestiary. The lower per product price point  was definitely more attractive to me. Further, unlike the other PDQ games mentioned, QMR is billed as having a deliberately 'open' structure which meant, to me, that it had more utility. <br/><br/>Basically, for me, lower a lower price point plus increased utility makes a more attractive product. <br/><br/>The Zorcerer of Zo was actually the first PDQ product that caught my attention but its price tag of $30 and relatively narrow focus bolstered by a large chunk of the book being dedicated to notes from the original campaign. . . well, it just didn't seem like a very good purchase for me in terms of dollars versus utility.<br/><br/>[ Edit: I guess I can end this on a high note by letting you know that I first examined ZoZ at the FLGS, which makes it a point to stock all of the Atomic Sock Monkey games <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92633/#Comment_92633" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T15:36:17+00:00" title="September  2, 2007  3:36PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            B combined with C.

But I looked at the PDQ core rules download and found they were missing some things I like to have in my games.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe resolution system in that download talked a lot about tasks -- whether a character did or did not perform some action or achieve some influence. But it didn't address how to go from "Yes, you did" or "No, you failed" to affecting the outcome of the story in play.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me explain using the old safe example. Say my character encounters a  big safe in a villain's hideout. Previous play has established that some incriminating evidence may exist that could reveal the villain -- who poses as a straightup pillar of the community. I don't know if it's in the safe and the GM hasn't told me, but I'm hopeful. I roll to see if my hero can open the safe. If I succeed, how does the group decide whether the evidence is in there? There's no mechanic in the rules for this. <br/>\n<br/>\nI like to play a game where the task roll also decides whether I get the evidence.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat, in a nutshell is why I didn't buy T&amp;J. I assumed it had the same resolution rules. If I bought the game, I'd have to propose a set of rules for that last part to my group, get their buy in, and adjust things like the damage rules to support the change. Rather than invest the effort, I've chosen to buy games that do include this aspect of resolution. It's a lot easier to get group understanding if it's right there in black and white.<br/>\n<br/>\n(For great task-resolution systems that do have this sort of mechanic, see Burning Wheel and Full Light, Full Steam).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92671/#Comment_92671" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T20:37:21+00:00" title="September  2, 2007  8:37PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: George Shannon</cite>A all the way.

That being the case, the consumer eats the cost (save for Lulu's minimal fees) when a product is purchased from that site. Now, if you're buying printed copies of your own books from Lulu for redistribution via other outlets (e.g., IPR, etc) I can see you needing a high price point to recoup costs because, at that point, <i>you</i> are the consumer (i.e., you're paying full cost for your own books via Lulu). I've actually been wondering about this recently. . . <br/><br/>The act of publishers buying their own books from Lulu for redistribution seems <i>very</i> inefficient. First, it is not the intended purpose of Lulu to act a large-scale printing press for physical products. Second, there are literally <i>hundreds</i> of large-scale printers out there who offer deep discounts for bulk print runs. Sure, I can see the <i>convenience</i> in using Lulu to print your own stuff (especially if you already have a POD account set up) but I fail to see the <i>wisdom</i> in doing so. From a financial standpoint, it makes ZERO sense. <br/><br/>If you do, in fact, use Lulu to stock your own warehouse, this begs the obvious question -- <i>why</i>? Why put yourself in the consumer's shoes and pay full retail for your own books when you can commission a significantly larger print run via a traditional press for significantly less money per unit?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92684/#Comment_92684" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T21:41:13+00:00" title="September  2, 2007  9:41PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I bought books from lulu (things may have changed) they did do bulk discounts for larger print runs (100+ books).

Further, it's worth noting that the Lulu discount for such purchases isn't nearly as deep as comparative discounts from many traditional printers (IME, anyhow).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Liminaut" title="Liminaut"><img alt="Liminaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Liminaut">Liminaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92687/#Comment_92687" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T23:11:01+00:00" title="September  2, 2007 11:11PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2007 11:23PM by Liminaut.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in a PDQ game right now -- Truth &amp; Justice, and truth to tell I don't think the system can take a lot of heavy lifting.

I do actually own two PDQ games - Zorcerer of Zo (book) and Dead Inside (PDF).  But I don't really like them all that much.  Don't misunderstand me - I don't <i>dislike</i> them, I just find the system somewhat bland.  I guess I'd say a combination of A, R, and maybe a tiny dash of F.  The "too traditional" thing is kind of weird, though, because I play as many traditional games as I do hippy ones.  It's just that both ZoZ and DI struck me as games that would be <i>better</i> if they were less traditional.  Or maybe even if they were <i>more</i> traditional.  But they're in a kind of half-way limbo that just doesn't really work for me, personally.<br/><br/>I do think your games are quality work, and I don't particularly regret my two purchases.  I'd probably play in a PDQ game if a friend of mine wanted to run one.

I got sold on the first one by the line "A game where you heal people and give them stuff" (or something like that) that I read in a review. I brought the pdf on the spot.  I brought the pdf of ZoZ much later, after reading about it in a "Out of the Box" article.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still have to finish reading both. Both time if was turned off by the "traditional" vibe (I didn't remember about DI when I brought ZoZ, I don't think I would have brought it if I had recalled the first experience).  It's not a problem of not being "modern and cutting edge" (I am not so a snob. I mean, just a little), but at this time in my gaming life I am still enraged about a lot of rubbish in the "traditional way of thinking", that only made me spend a lot of time and money for nothing in the past, and I am instead very enthusiastic about the games born from the Forge community.  Maybe your games are much better than other that I play, but at this time I don't think I can give them an objective valutation.  At this moment I have not a very nice opinion, in general, of "traditional" systems.

I AM into them!</b><br><br>Sort of.<br><br>I have Dead Inside.  I bought it about 2 years ago from Lulu.  See, I had decided there were things on Lulu which I wanted and at the time shipping to the UK was pretty expensive.  But it got cheaper per book if you bought a lot of stuff.  So I pretty much ordered anything I could find on Lulu which I had any interest in.  I remembered DI from your posts on the Forge and RPG.net back in the day and thought it sounded interesting, so it went into the basket.<br><br><b>(Now, post your favorite noun du jour.)</b><br><br>Marzipan.<br><br><b>B. They are too expensive.</b><br><br>They are mostly too expensive for an impulse buy.  That is, I would buy a game at the price I can get PDQ stuff for, but I'd have to be certain I wanted/had time to read/run it.<br/><br/><b>K. The genre/subject matter doesn't interest me.</b><br/><br/>This applies somewhat to both ZoZ and T&amp;J.  I'm not hot enough for the subject matters to impulse buy the games, but I'm interested.<br/><br/>Next time I get the urge to run a supers game, I'll probably pick up T&amp;J, but that hasn't happened for a while.<br/><br/><b>O. I just haven't gotten to it yet (though I plan to).</b><br/>&amp;<br/><b>R. There is too much other cool stuff to get first.</b><br/><br/>And here comes the worst bit: I've had DI for two years but haven't actually read it properly yet.  I looked it over, but there's just too much other cool shit in my life.  That's not a reflection on the quality of the product, what I've read I've really liked.  But, for example, I could have spent some time on Saturday reading it, but I was too engrossed in Viva Pi\xc3\xb1ata on the XBox.  Yesterday I was at a con and met <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0921942/" rel="nofollow">Billy West</a>.  Actually that has nothing to do with why I didn't read DI, it's just fucking cool and I wanted to tell someone.  But I've never got around to reading it properly.<br/><br/>I looked over a copy of T&amp;J about a year ago.  Didn't quite buy it because I'd already bought about \xc2\xa380 worth of other stuff that day.<br/><br/><b>Q. There is no Q.</b><br/><br/>Or spoon.<br/><br/><b>T. The games aren't sold anywhere I shop.</b><br/><br/>I don't have a local games shop any more.  Come to think of it, I haven't actually been to a games shop in the year since my local shop closed.  So any impulse buys I do are online.<br/><br/>This is worth noting: IIRC, T&amp;J was available from Lulu at one point.  With the recent discount shipping to us Europeans, I've been buying a shitload of stuff from Lulu over the last few of months.  T&amp;J and ZoZ are not available from Lulu, and DI isn't there any more.  If T&amp;J was available from Lulu, I would definitely have bought it.  If ZoZ was available, probably would have bought it by now.  For example, I bought Tim's Questers of the Middle Realm, because, well, it was there.<br/><br/><b>Z. Something else (please let me know!).</b><br/><br/>1) The layout of DI is minimal and the artwork is ugly and/or badly reproduced.  It works and doesn't hamper me reading and understanding the game but it's not attractive.  T&amp;J, from my time looking over it, is much the same.  This means that this is a book you buy only for reading and running the game.  It has no aesthetic value to me, I have no desire to own the T&amp;J book as an object.  I do have a mild desire to own the book so I can read it.  Compare that to, say, Burning Empires or the new Deadlands: Reloaded book, both of which I own.

The game is too traditional/mainstream.<br/>\n</b><br/>\n<br/>\nHigh trust systems aren't. They have aspects that one might confuse with mainstream gaming. A mainstream game doesn't output directly into narrative structure because narrative is hermeneutic in mainstream games. In PDQ outputting to narrative would be a low-trust feature since it assumes that you need to be paternally forced to obey structure, and that's not PDQ's bag, as I understand it. PDQ gives you a bunch of signifiers but lets you decide how they jump into narrative elements<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>G. You don't participate enough in online fora.</b><br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I find the demand for a relationship and the way the scene conflates person and product a creepy thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>H.

"Truth &amp; Justice" sounds sort of like a supers game that's kind of traditional, and kind of indie; I've got other games on either side of that spectrum so I'm not sure what "T&amp;J;" would do for me.  "Zorcerer of Zo" is some kind of game about children's stories, right?  It gets a little bit of attention on RPG.Net, but the threads seem pretty self-contained and well-mannered, so I never click through.  Apparently people here really like "Dead Inside," but this is the first I've heard about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike: I'm aware that you exist and that you write games.

It works and doesn't hamper me reading and understanding the game but it's not attractive. T&amp;J, from my time looking over it, is much the same. This means that this is a book you buy only for reading and running the game. It has no aesthetic value to me, I have no desire to own the T&amp;J book as an object. I do have a mild desire to own the book so I can read it. Compare that to, say, Burning Empires or the new Deadlands: Reloaded book, both of which I own. Both are (to me) attractive objects as well as being games I enjoy and book's I've read.</blockquote>\nOne of the major benefits to the Evil Hat Productions partnership is that this sort of thing will be dealt with.

The overall hobby size isn't all that big, but it seems intensely fragmented. (Thus, people who know my <i>GURPS</i>/<i>Pyramid</i> work don't know my <i>Unknown Armies</i> work, and so on.)  It's really, really interesting that adventure gaming is so fragmented from the macro-scale (styles of games, say <i>D&amp;D</i> vs. <i>WarHammer</i>) to the mid-scale (<i>D&amp;D</i> vs. <i>Palladium</i>) to the micro-scale (Forgotten Realms vs. Eberron).<br/><br/>Thank you all for your help, and keep 'em coming.<br/><br/>CU                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92806/#Comment_92806" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T13:41:53+00:00" title="September  3, 2007  1:41PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chadu</cite>Germany (the Tyrol; now part of Italy, maybe?) via Pennsylvania.</blockquote>\nNow, isn't the world a small place (I'm italian, and was in sudtirol only a month or so ago)?

Thank you!<br/><br/>Looking at recent posts, I'm struck by something. In my experience, I often buy game material for campaigns that, when I run them, I run under a different system -- essentially mining out material, often setting-stuff or theme-/tone-stuff. In a way, all game products are "supplements" to my game experience.<br/><br/>There seems to be strong impulses to:<br/>* Only buy/play/use as-is supplementary material for certain games that is explicitly in the product line.<br/>* Only buy focused designs that only produce a single type of game.<br/>* Go for universal systems that have trememndous genre/setting/style support.<br/>* Go for a focused system that is CLOSE to target setting tone (using Traveller for Firefly, for example).<br/><br/>These can overlap even in and of themselves, not just how people use them to play.<br/><br/>But the "setting/tone/fluff material to be mined and applied elsewhere" category doesn't seem to be quite as common.

I used to have much less of a problem to buy something that I'd probably not play, with the plan to mine it for ideas. <br/><br/>But while I did that sometimes, often these games would sit in my shelf without seeing much use and so I've been slowly training myself to only buy books I'd use a substantial part of.

But as I wouldn't play it using the nWoD system (Which I don't really like), I'd pay quite a bit of money for a book I'd only use a fraction of, and with other games out there that I can love and use completly, those are just worth more to me...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92893/#Comment_92893" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T06:03:56+00:00" title="September  4, 2007  6:03AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Z.

Note to people who haven't read T&amp;J: starting characters start with 10 pts of Qualities (non-super abilities) and 6 pts of powers.  Roll 2d6 and add the total of Qualities and Powers applicable.<br/><br/>First Character: Thug with Bat: +4 with a baseball bat.  Now, TwB will pasturize almost every example character listed in  the T&amp;J.  Most of the example characters have +2 or +0 in their base combat.  On 2d6, +2 (+4 vs +2) is a huge advantage. Looking at the example characters most of them have most of their points sunk into Qualities and Powers that basically function as color.  For instance, Snow Owl's flight doesn't help the guy at all in resolving conflicts (Flight at +0).  It's just a way for the player to describe SO showing up on the scene.<br/><br/>Why does this matter to me?  When I play a system I want to be able pump the fuel lines with nitro step on the gas and GO! I feel like with T&amp;J to play characters like in the book I've got to play three-speed Schwins.  TwB can give most of the book characters a lot of grief, let alone the high-octane critters I normally come up with.<br/><br/>They way I've seen T&amp;J kind of work is by actually throwing away the system.  The GM I'm playing with looks at our abilities and makes a call; no dice, no rolls.  So "decribe your character and the GM tells you what happens" is a pretty good alternative to T&amp;J as I've seen it work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93096/#Comment_93096" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T23:18:46+00:00" title="September  4, 2007 11:18PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2007 11:21PM by chadu.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Liminaut</cite>First Character: Thug with Bat: +4 with a baseball bat.

I'm tempted to talk about how the "science badass" super I've played could handle Thug with Bat, but someone who says "I want to be able pump the fuel lines with nitro step on the gas and GO!" without seeing exactly how T&amp;J is streamlined for that is someone who will dismiss my example as perhaps at best an edge case.<br/><br/>For everyone else, though, I have a tagline for T&amp;J:  Play the hero you want, not just the hero you can afford.  If I wanted to make said "science badass" super, whose main power is "manipulate non-living matter at the atomic level," uh, that would be very, very expensive in GURPS* (or perhaps very, very limiting for the amount of character points I could use).  And, that would be very over-powerful if I was given unlimited points to play with, compared to my fellows.  In T&amp;J, this character can stand beside Superman and Batman as equals, and still be a scary badass when rolling Science!

Good [+2] Super-Strength ups that attack to +6, and adds +9 to any damage that connects. Average [+0] Super-Armor means that Thug has to beat his defense by more than 7 to even damage him at all. This is so easy a win for the  Ranger, I'd probably throttle the GM that actually called for rolls here.<br/><br/>Second up: Manticore - Master [+6] Tiger Claw Wushu, Master [+6] Gymnast means he attacks at +6 and defends at +12. This isn't even counting his stunts. Once again, an easy mop-up.<br/><br/>Third up: Snow Owl - Good [+2] Outdoorsman and Good [+2] Freeze Beam means he defends at +2 and attacks at +4, but consider something else... Snow Owl can attack at range, so, can the TwB even get to him to hit him? And, would the Bat quality really help defend against the Freeze Beam? Not as sure a victory as the other two, but especially with Hero Points in tow, this will still go to Snow pretty much... all the time.<br/><br/>Going through the rest of the book characters reveals that, amazingly enough, characters not built for combat aren't that good at combat. Um, well... yeah. And even many of the ones who aren't, like Ultrawoman and Doctor Widget (who, by the way, are built purposely as NPCs and not as PCs, and it says so) have at least one power that mitigates the effects of normal combat with normal-scale individuals. And starting PCs can absorb around 15-18 quality reductions each.<br/><br/>So, I put it to you, TwB not only fails to pasteurize many characters in the book, but he also fails to give many of them significant trouble, even.<br/><br/>(Cross-posted with the Mack and Chad.

I'm always looking for new ideas for the next session I have with my players.</blockquote>\nSure, though I'll try to keep the "dude, let me tell you about my character!" to a minimum.  Relevant stats for Mendeleev, Matter Transmuter (which was totally inspired by watching Fullmetal Alchemist):\n<ul><li>Master [+6] Science! Quality</li><li>Master [+6] Matter Transmutation Meta-Power -- relevant Power Stunts (all Good [+2]):\n<ul><li>Phasing (By affecting things around him, not actually affecting him)</li><li>Matter Control (Altering matter, like changing lead to gold, changing density, etc.)</li></ul></li></ul>\nThe power has limitations, chief among them that he cannot affect living (or recently living) matter.  There's a bit more, but that's enough for this example.  That should be enough to explain why the character can't alter Thug with Bat directly.<br/><br/>The key that makes the character fairly badass: the same way that someone can take a "Olympic Bodybuilder" quality and stack it on a "Super-Strength" power, Mendeleev can take "Science!" and stack it on "Matter Transmutation," since he's using my knowledge of science to achieve specific transmutations.  Some GMs might count this as overkill, but in T&amp;J games I run it's pretty kosher -- I hope this example demonstrates why.<br/><br/>So, how would he deal with Thug with Bat with the character?  If TwB attacks, then he would defend by:<br/>* Phasing the bat: Science! [+6] + Phasing [+2]<br/>* Turning the bat into a pile of feathers: Science! [+6] + Matter Transmutation [+2]<br/><br/>He would attack with:<br/>* Phasing the ground around him for a moment, trapping him:  Science! [+6] + Phasing [+2]<br/>* If it was a vicious fight, turn his bat into a bomb:  Science! [+6] + Matter Transmutation [+2]<br/>* If this was a really dark game, transmute the air around him into chlorine: Science! [+6] + Matter Transmutation [+2]<br/>* A "lighter" version of the above would turn the air around him into nitrous oxide.<br/><br/>What's important:  This is *exactly* the same, mechanically-speaking, as Olympic Bodybuilder [+6] + Super-Strength [+2].  Sure, I'm narrating "I'm altering the composition of the matter" rather than "I'm totally punching a dude," and there is a difference in the situation I can apply the character's powers and what you can defend his attacks with, but there's nothing overwhelming about this character that makes him unworkable in a team situation.<br/><br/>How could Thug with Bat mess his day up?  By throwing a punch.  I think that's my favorite part about the character: he's the ultimate science nerd...but he can still be beaten up by the ultimate jock.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's what I get out of T&amp;J:  awesome characters that work well in a group situation and are truly equals.  I get the JLA without having to fudge stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93169/#Comment_93169" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T10:16:58+00:00" title="September  5, 2007 10:16AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2007 10:19AM by Tim_Gray.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AA.

However, in this case, I'm trying to pair down a dozen or so indie supers games, each of which is trying to do exciting and different things, which is hard to get a handle on without playing them.  But from reviews and online discussions, I was able to pair down the several titles to three that sounded right to me, which is what I went to hunt down more info.  Demos seem like the way it works in indie games.<br/><br/>Although, I should point out, I went to GenCon hoping to get into a full session of all three games.  I only discovered demos at this past GenCon.  Given my druthers, I would have 2-4 hours with any game I'm looking at.  But, a 15 minute demo is enough to see whether the game matches my taste enough to make a purchase.<br/><br/>Hell, I've owned Hero's Banner for a year, and understood it, but was intimidated about running it. It wasn't until a couple of weeks ago at GenCon, getting Tim to demo the game for me that I went "Oh! This is really easy!"  So, demo's aren't just good for selling a new copy, but can help get people excited about playing and running the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93251/#Comment_93251" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T15:17:22+00:00" title="September  5, 2007  3:17PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chadu</cite><b>Why is a demo of a new game book vitally important to you before you purchase?</b></blockquote>\nI have precious little time to play games anymore, and my money is somewhat squoze.

The previews on your website were cool as well. Also as a longtime HeroQuest Narrator, I was intrigued to see if Tim's claims of it being a 'HQ-lite' held water.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I bought Truth and Justice in pdf and most of my computer time is work or writing my own stuff I've not had a deep read yet. However what I've read I like; your author's voice to me is informative, light but not arrogant or pretentious (these last two aspects are big turn offs for me when reading). Being a brit who was raised on sci-fi/war comics the sections explaining the types of stories and themes behind the Superhero genre is pure gold. So next week work's printer is going to be heavily used, and I'll be reading in depth.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I think its early days and word about the PDQ is slowly getting out to gamers who are beginning to get interested in what small press games can offer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93977/#Comment_93977" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T08:29:52+00:00" title="September  8, 2007  8:29AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See, these pom-poms aren't just for show!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dadiceguy" title="dadiceguy"><img alt="dadiceguy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dadiceguy">dadiceguy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94107/#Comment_94107" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T20:53:07+00:00" title="September  8, 2007  8:53PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A) I am into them.

I would not have bought T&amp;J without trying it first but my husband did.  After playing it, I liked it enough to start looking at all the other PDQ games, one after the other, and like the core system more and more.<br><br>Sometimes when I have more money available, when I have read a lot about the game's design or have had a lot of free samples, when the game is recommended by someone I trust, or when I know the author and am confident this should be a good fit for me, I buy without playtesting first but having played certainly helps.  That's why I enjoy trying new games at conventions and at the open Monday night games at our local club.
