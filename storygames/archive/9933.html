The rules say that switching a weapon calls for an NFA roll but does that mean that the weapon can then be used on that turn or is the entire turn taken up with switching over to a weapon? The rules say that a soldier can switch to HTH for free but that assumes that switching back to a regular weapon requires a roll - what happens if a player who is using a sidearm (pistol) and switches to power claw - are they still required to make a roll to use the sidearm (even though both weapons are still carried and presumably "at the ready")?<br/>\n<br/>\nSadly, the rules are a tiny bit vague about how this "weapon switching" is actually supposed to go down and as turns are so tight in the game, I don't want to play loose with the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220707/#Comment_220707" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-25T06:40:59+00:00" title="July 25, 2009  6:40AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At any time. Think of it like an Interrupt in Magic: the Gathering. The only limitation is that you cannot reply to a Strength with a Strength. You may reply to a Weakness with a Strength, or vice versa, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may abandon your action by canceling (assuming you succeed). That cancels all actions that come after yours as well. This is tactically useful to keep others from taking kills, among other uses. Otherwise, what you rolled is what you rolled.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe typical ruling I've seen is that switching weapons takes up an NFA action. My ruling, which I believe was supported by Gregor, is that you can switch weapons along with other NFA actions, such as moving, or attempting to get a bonus on your next action, so long as it makes sense within the fiction. Unless the weapon says you can switch to it "for free", it requires an NFA roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake sure you know what weapons they're using as a "default" weapon for the mission. They can't just declare a new default weapon at the beginning of each combat, based on the positioning roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kakupacal" title="kakupacal"><img alt="kakupacal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kakupacal">kakupacal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220709/#Comment_220709" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-25T07:30:41+00:00" title="July 25, 2009  7:30AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the reply but I still need clarifications.<br>\n<br>\nExample: at the start of the round, Trooper Schmoe says "I am at near range so I am going to throw grenades at the mean monsters" - FA rolls are made and as a result of range changes, Trooper Schmoe and several other marines are now at close range. Can Trooper Schmoe decide to cancel his action at this point? Can he cancel his action in a way that isn't an official CANCEL ACTION, so that it doesn't negate all actions that are to follow? <br>\n<br>\nAnd back to my first question: if a marine is using a power glove in one combat action and has his sidearm out as his previous weapon, is switching back to the one-handed (semi-ready) sidearm actually count as an action for that turn?                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220711/#Comment_220711" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-25T08:44:34+00:00" title="July 25, 2009  8:44AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nope.
