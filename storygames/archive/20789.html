I feel like I'm mostly picking nits, but in the spirit of helpfulness (and if any of this is anything less than helpful, do tell me to shut my trap):<br/><br/>I've noticed, repeatedly, in the Barf Forth forums, and the PbtA g+, that people coming from DW tend to do alright with PbtA hacks - but people coming from DnD (and thus, generally, I see this happening in DW discussions) tend not to do so well. they carry over a lot of their DnD habits, and end up disregarding a lot of the PbtA rules while just keeping the task resolution mechanics. Accordingly, for a fantasy-looking PbtA hack, I'm kind of on the lookout for things that will tend to go awry if you're coming from the DnD direction on things:<br/><br/>So:<br/>a) Pg 2, "sometimes a rule will tell you to make a move. Don't name the move, just describe the action" (paraphrasing a tiny bit). I think this will tend to confuse people unfamiliar with PbtA mechanics, who are not familiar with "moves are mechanics triggered by the fiction, rather than a mechanical manifestation of a fictional act."<br/><br/>b) Pg 3, MC duties. I really like that this is front and center; I think it tends to get ignored in a lot of read-throughs as "that chapter of GMing tips bs". I would like to see it more explicitly that these aren't purple-prose GMing tips, but explicit delineations of the MC's responsibilities, and deviations from these duties are as much rule-breaking as using loaded dice. I get that kind of goes in a different direction than pg 4's principles text, "in the spirit of...", which makes it sound more optional to "be a fan of the characters" (a spot where a lot of people new to PbtA seem to have a stumbling block.)<br/><br/>c) "Make your moves hard or soft." I'd add the bit about how hard moves should usually be preceded by a soft move that gave them the chance to avoid it. Or not, if you've omitted that intentionally.<br/><br/>d) MC Moves. I'd make more explicit that these are actually the explicit list of moves the MC has to call upon; that they can be used more or less broadly, but that this is *actually* the list. I seem to recall a discussion ... mm, either it was here or Barf Forth, where someone noted their first-time MC, old-school d20 GM, would have them "roll to discern realities" upon entering a new room, as a standard perception check. Nope: Discern Realities is not an MC move.<br/><br/><br/>Okay, so, non-"things old-school GMs tend to trip over things". I'm referring to rogue, 'cause I'm writing my comments as I read the page, in order. This may hold true for the other playbooks as well:<br/><br/>1) The rogue abilities appear to be exhaustible, but it doesn't explicitly say so (just says that "each box can hold two slashes," and level up has an add a box option). It's probably worth stating explicitly, since it seems to be a core mechanic. What happens if we run out of ability boxes? Retirement?<br/><br/>2) How are these abilities triggered by the fiction? I.e., Keen, "add +1 to a roll where you rely on precision, quickness, insight." Does that mean any time a rogue uses precision, quickness, or insight that they're knocking off a piece of a finite, exhaustible ability? If not, what fictional event triggers these moves? How would a player "not name the move, but describe how it feels to your character" (paraphrasing from, I think, pg 2)?  Your intro doesn't actually say "to do it, do it," so I could just be carrying-over an expectation that isn't appropriate, and you don't mean for the fiction and moves to be as closely aligned as they are in AW, in which case ... I'm one of those people carrying baggage into a new game, sorry. This seems to apply to a lot of the rogue abilities, though, so it seems like a core issue to address: is "to do it, do it" a rule in this game? If so, the abilities may need reworking. If not, maybe state that explicitly, so putzes like me don't carry their *W baggage into it.<br/><br/>3) Barter, supply, specialties: the rogue here seems very, very mercantile. I'm looking forward to moves that rely on monetary power to make this worthwhile. I don't see any yet, so it seems like a lot of the class is focused on just acquiring color.<br/><br/>4) I see point 2 being repeated for the warrior. <br/><br/>5) The warrior's maneuvers "count as innate weapon moves." I didn't see anything elsewhere to use as a counterpoint to clarify what that means. Does it mean that I don't have to unlock that ability with an advance? Or that it's not exhaustible?<br/><br/>6) Rogue/Warrior maneuver/specialty questions seem to elucidate advantages/specialties. For the sage, the analogous question seems to be Methods, but it looks more like a restriction than a niche or color. Is that intentional? How do these interact with the "Spellcraft" rules (e.g., how do we cross "simple, subtle magic should be easily accomplished" with "requires the aid of a skilled apprentice," for instance?).<br/><br/>7) Pg 15, character set-up, I can "assign 5 points, and I start with one box of..." Does that mean 1 point=1 box? Do sub-abilities (the ones with boxes) require a point to purchase? It's unclear if the box is an indicator of what you have, or your maximum capacity before burn-out.<br/>7a) If I buy "another box" with an advance, how does that apply to sub-abilities with boxes under umbrella abilities with boxes? e.g., Commanding has boxes, so does "Ignore any one demand when making war." Do I buy boxes for the Ignore ability? If I use Ignore, do I also slash Commanding, as its umbrella power? <br/><br/>8) Items have moves that can be bought w/ advances. I see these have boxes. Does that mean these boxes are exhaustible, too: if I buy armor with deflect blow (or whatever), does that mean it only deflects 2 blows before I lose that ability?<br/>8a) If these are exhaustible abilities, are they tied to the item or to the character? That is, do I learn to "Deflect a blow" with any armor I wear from now on, and exhaust it with two uses, or does that specific piece of armor deflect blows, and the armor is exhausted after two blows? <br/><br/>Got to the end. Still don't understand why so much of the rogue abilities seem to be related to mercantile stuff, when I don't see that mercantile stuff come up elsewhere as being important.<br/><br/>Anyway, I hope that was helpful; it was very much intended to be. I look forward to future iterations, and ultimately getting to play this!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456532/#Comment_456532" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-23T15:43:24+00:00" title="September 23, 2016  3:43PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 23, 2016 3:45PM by Dirk.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the thorough response <a href="/forums/profile/miedvied">@miedvied</a>, very helpful. I think there's a few things worth defending here, so let me try to articulate a few things better.<br/><br/>Re: assumptions about moves, d&amp;d, pbta<br/>a) A clarification here: In this game, a move is not "mechanics triggered by the fiction." I've actually never understood the conflated usage of the term "move" in AW, meaning both "a rule" (when x, do y) and something that happens. To more clearly articulate the structure, I simply call the former "rules."<br/>I think I would clarify the text by adding, in the game concepts, "making a move means saying what happens in the fiction."<br/><br/>b) I'm not sure how to be more plain and explicit than saying "these are your duties during the game." I understand many players won't be used to being assigned such explicit duties, but I not super interested in taking responsibility for that. Similarly, "Follow your principles" is a rule, is explained as a rule, and is the very first rule on the list. I think the game benefits from allowing players to interpret "the spirit of the principles" according to their culture of play, I'm not afraid for "being a fan of the characters" to mean something slightly different to each group. Total replicability is not a goal.<br/><br/>c) I had the same idea, struggled with how to word it and ended up deciding it wan't strictly necessary. If you're following your principles (say what flows from the fiction,) you might or might not follow up a soft move with a hard version of the same move. If they make a bad roll to evade the sword swing, you might say they get hit by the sword, or you might say they tumble backwards off the ledge.<br/><br/>d) I think I'm generally inclined to trust players more than that, re: these are the only moves you're allowed to make. I think the more important idea is, (from the MC Rules:) "When another player asks or looks to you to see what happens next, make a move." (in other words, MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN) I think "Make a move = make something happen" needs to be more clearly articulated and underscored, but I'm totally jazzed if players want to make up their own moves to better serve their duties.<br/><br/>Making them discern realities is not making something happen--that's against the rules. It's also against the "Answer questions" rule: "Players are always entitled to answers about what their character sees, hears, feels, or knows."<br/><br/>Re: other stuff\n<blockquote>1) The rogue abilities appear to be exhaustible, but it doesn't explicitly say so (just says that "each box can hold two slashes," and level up has an add a box option). It's probably worth stating explicitly, since it seems to be a core mechanic. What happens if we run out of ability boxes? Retirement?<br/><br/>2) How are these abilities triggered by the fiction? I.e., Keen, "add +1 to a roll where you rely on precision, quickness, insight." Does that mean any time a rogue uses precision, quickness, or insight that they're knocking off a piece of a finite, exhaustible ability?<br/></blockquote>\nFrom the common rules:<br/><br/>"Invoke abilities <br/>When you call on one of your Abilities to help you, mark a slash through a box and choose one of the options associated with that ability. You may do this at any time, even after the dice are rolled. Each box may hold up to two slashes, the second slash forming an \u2018X.\u2019 Boxes with an \u2018X\u2019 are not easily recovered."<br/><br/>The trigger here could be tightened. Maybe, <b>"Whenever you like, you may mark a slash through an Ability box to choose one of the options."</b><br/><br/>"Pass the Night<br/>When you eat a good meal and pass several hours in rest, choose one: <br/>\u2022 recover all ability boxes with a single slash. <br/>\u2022 repair all armor boxes with a single slash<br/>\u2022 hold 2; spend your hold during the upcoming day to add one die to a roll."<br/><br/>Again, according to the p.2 definitions, these are not "moves" at all, they're rules. The only thing about rules is "when x, do y," like any other rule in any other game. It may or may not be about the fiction. Again, frustration with AW's conflation of "rules to follow" and "things that happen" as both being "moves." They're very distinct concepts. Go aggro is a rule, goddamnit.\n<blockquote>Barter, supply, specialties: the rogue here seems very, very mercantile. I'm looking forward to moves that rely on monetary power to make this worthwhile. I don't see any yet, so it seems like a lot of the class is focused on just acquiring color.</blockquote>\nHmm, not sure what you mean here. Every class book has a place to record barter and supply. It's just a way to keep track of money and gear. There's only one rogue specialty related at all to money. Should characters not have a place to write down gear?\n<blockquote>5) The warrior's maneuvers "count as innate weapon moves." I didn't see anything elsewhere to use as a counterpoint to clarify what that means. Does it mean that I don't have to unlock that ability with an advance? Or that it's not exhaustible?</blockquote>\nIt means that when a rule tells you to "make a weapon move," those maneuvers are always among your options.\n<blockquote>6) Rogue/Warrior maneuver/specialty questions seem to elucidate advantages/specialties. For the sage, the analogous question seems to be Methods, but it looks more like a restriction than a niche or color. Is that intentional? How do these interact with the "Spellcraft" rules (e.g., how do we cross "simple, subtle magic should be easily accomplished" with "requires the aid of a skilled apprentice," for instance?).</blockquote>\nIt's intentionally more restrictive. The sage can break the laws of reality: the methods reign that in. The text from the Spellcraft rule reads: "Simple, subtle magic should be easily accomplished <b>with standard methods.</b>" I can imagine that in lots of situations, using standard methods might also trigger defy danger.<br/><br/>7-8)  <blockquote>Pg 15, character set-up, I can "assign 5 points, and I start with one box of..." Does that mean 1 point=1 box? Do sub-abilities (the ones with boxes) require a point to purchase? It's unclear if the box is an indicator of what you have, or your maximum capacity before burn-out.</blockquote>\nYep, the boxes in the options/move lists are hella confusing. A box just means it's an option/move that has to be purchased, is not available by default. Once purchased, it's an option forever, not exhaustible. Used in the same way as other options. Planning to revise the formatting there to round bubbles to relieve some of the confusion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456534/#Comment_456534" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-23T15:54:42+00:00" title="September 23, 2016  3:54PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'll have to look more carefully.

It's an excellent list!<br/><br/>The GM side gives me a good idea of what do when we're playing, yes, but I feel like I'm missing some larger context.<br/><br/>For example, in Apocalypse World and Monsterhearts, both, there's a clear sense of what's happening and why we're playing. In Apocalypse World, everything has gone to shit, nothing is safe, and everyone is struggling to stay alive, find some beauty or comfort, maybe rebuild society: there are threats everywhere and we've got to deal with them. There's constant pressure from threats and scarcities, and a strong implication that everyone is part of the same community. "Can you build something lasting in this fucked-up world?" <br/><br/>In Monsterhearts, we're all students at school together, likely in a small town, and we're playing the "high school game": everyone knows what that's like. We want to maybe find love - or just get laid, to get passing grades and graduate from school, to climb the popularity ladder, keep bullies from controlling our lives, keep adults from controlling our lives, and so forth. Each character is dealing with the horror of their own monster nature - a metaphor for adolescence and growing up. All this stuff is grist for the mill. "Can you carve out a life for yourself despite everything being terribly wrong, and your own body betraying you?"<br/><br/>In Dungeon World, we have an adventuring party going out to find treasures and slay monsters (e.g. see the XP rules for "end of session"). In Monster of the Week, you play investigators trying to stop a monster from killing. And so on.<br/><br/>What is the larger sense of what's going on in your game? The Bonds establish that the characters know each other. Do they interact? Are they friends or foes? Are they in separate storylines altogether? What do I do with all these "peoples" in play? Are they just background information or are they something I'm supposed to use to create situations?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456558/#Comment_456558" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-24T16:30:34+00:00" title="September 24, 2016  4:30PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2016 4:30PM by Paul_T.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, a minor note:<br/><br/>You spend time explaining that "+1" means "+1 hit" each time it appears.

I think I'd say it's missing a <i>compelling starting situation.</i> When I've run this, something interesting has always emerged from the peoples creation, but that's pretty thin and fickle and doesn't do much to entice anyone to play it in the first place.<br/><br/>My idea is to write a few different "playsets" that you'd fill out as a group after peoples creation (or maybe before, I dunno?) Playsets would have questions tailored to a certain broad type of story (though I suppose you could get as specific as you like.) Like, "the warring kingdoms," "the crumbling empire," "a city of the wastes," "the age of dragons," etc. In a similar vein the the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20146/impressionistic-dungeons#latest" rel="nofollow">adventure starters </a> I've done in the past.<br/><br/>Maybe the last question on each playsets establishes who the characters are as a group ("conscriptees in the king's army," "lone survivors of a wrecked village," "heroes of a past age, called to council" "a band of virtuous criminals," etc depending on the broader context.)<br/><br/>I think that's the thing I should do right next to make this pop better. (after I fix this check box/bubble problem.)<br/><br/>re: strips of paper,<br/>the idea is that each player collects those into their book to keep track of between sessions. by the end of a long DW campaign everyone at my table has like a dozen index cards spread around to keep track of and it's a real mess, trying to improve that interface a little bit. haven't played a long enough game to get a good sense how it will work yet.<br/><br/>re: +1 hit notations,<br/>gotcha, that's much neater. depends slightly on how it impacts layout (I've probably foolishly made a lot of things subservient to my layout/interface concerns) but I think that's a good change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456562/#Comment_456562" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-25T00:30:44+00:00" title="September 25, 2016 12:30AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2016 12:34AM by Dirk.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For play sets, even something as direct as the situating paragraph in Eowyn could work,\n<blockquote>\u201cWhen Fall stalks its way into Ithilien at last, \xc9owyn finds herself haunted by nightmares.

There she meets an apparition: an ancient, noble, bearded man. His beard reaches to the ground and though his back is bent with unspoken burdens, yet his eyes hold a noble light not oft found amongst the Men of this Age. He explains to her that he has long departed this world but, nevertheless,seeks her aid in a time of great need.Some power beyond his understanding has sent him to right a great wrong: someone or something has been at the battlefield of Minas Tirith and found the object of its desire in the place where the Witch-King fell in battle. The apparition worries that this could be ill news -perhaps someone wishes to revive an ancient terror, or draw on some other sort of fell sorcery?Nought that is fair or good could come from such a fell place.He beseeches \xc9owyn  to find this man, woman, or creature and stop it from whatever it is doing.

Does the game assume they will work together?<br/><br/>Some notes:<br/><br/>Under "Bonds", it says that you should have one with each other character. When you are directed to create Bonds, though, you only do it with the person on your left.<br/><br/>Also:<br/><br/>I keep asking you about the probabilities of failure, but I keep forgetting that most actions require more than one "hit". So you can ignore me! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I still think you should rewrite the language around "+1" to "+1 hit". Would be easier and simpler, and you could get rid of that whole section in the rules document.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
