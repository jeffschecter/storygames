Player characters (PCs) are differentiated from non-player characters (NPCs) by the fact that only their owner may control them during roleplaying, unless the owner explicitly gives permission to another player.<br/><br/>In addition, PCs must have one or more central conflicts, for example:<br/><br/>    A secret that they\u2019re trying to keep.<br/>    A desire to prove themselves to someone.<br/>    A moral code that conflicts with their orders.<br/><br/><b><br/>Questions</b><br/><br/>Other players may add questions about a PC, which the character\u2019s player may then choose to explore through roleplaying.<br/><br/>Some examples of questions:<br/><br/>    What happens when someone discovers Alex\u2019s secret?<br/>    Who or what is Richard afraid of?<br/>    Why does Alex hate Emily?<br/><br/><br/>These can be \u2018leading questions\u2019 -- for example, maybe there\u2019s nothing about Alex hating Emily in the character\u2019s entry, but Emily belongs to the player asking the question, and they\u2019re trying to set up a conflict. If the player who owns the character doesn\u2019t like the question, they can edit it back out. However, if the player decides to use a question in one of their roleplaying threads, the player who asked the question gets 5 points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
