In fact, over the final months of 2011, my group developed and play-tested a full Space Opera setting for Solar System.<br/><br/>Normally, we would release it under a Creative Commons license of some sort, but <a href="http://lisbongamer.mc-two.com/2012/01/07/in-memoriam/" rel="nofollow">one of the developers passed away</a> over New Year's Eve, and so we're going a different route. To that end, I'm sort of looking around to see if I can find some peoples willing to do some pro-bono illustration work.<br/><br/>In any case, I just wanted to pop in and add a link to <a href="http://lisbongamer.mc-two.com/2012/02/03/agora-solar-system-goes-space-opera/" rel="nofollow">my blog post about Agora</a>, and see if anyone has anything to say...<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>J.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357735/#Comment_357735" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-04T06:43:43+00:00" title="February  4, 2012  6:43AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A question occurs: do you think that <i>three</i> Pool for a penalty die is a good exchange rate? This is definitely not an universal thing, but in my play the economy has almost always settled in the range from "penalty dice cost 2 Pool a piece" and "penalty dice cost 1 Pool + the number of penalty dice", with occasional special crunch enabling even "penalty dice cost 1 Pool apiece", giving them out for the same price as bonus dice. The crunch examples from Agora seem to agree that the proper price for even a pretty specialized penalty die (like "use only when the inquisitor is being non-violently resisted" special) is three Pool, which seems really expensive to me.<br/><br/>Penalty dice are at their most valuable when they're used against an opponent without a ready source of bonus dice available while you yourself have ample bonus dice. In general a penalty die for the opponent will be better for you than a bonus die for yourself when you have more bonus dice than the opponent (or if you already have a good result rolled on the dice). Penalty dice can certainly be devastating occasionally, but it is situational.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JMendes" title="JMendes"><img alt="JMendes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pwp.netcabo.pt/0167757301/patch.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JMendes">JMendes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357745/#Comment_357745" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-04T07:38:38+00:00" title="February  4, 2012  7:38AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Eero, <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Almost every Secret in Agora is pricier than in The West or TSoY, anywhere from 30% pricier to 100% pricier. This is because they all drink from the same Default Pool, rather than from the more specialized, and therefore smaller, Vigor, Instinct and Reason pools.<br/>All characters start with 10 Default Pool. A larger pool means we can jack up the prices a bit before the character is locked out of their main staples. For instance, the Agora version for the Secret of Training is 1 Default to activate (at which point, it gives you nothing), plus 1 Default per extra bonus die.<br/><br/>Thus, yes, three Pool per penalty die sounded good in development. Also, it worked well in play. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The crunch bits that are payed for with Subsystem Pools are priced at normal TSoY/The West price ranges.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>J.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357748/#Comment_357748" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-04T08:17:59+00:00" title="February  4, 2012  8:17AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All that makes sense.

This is an enduring pricing problem in SS, as most crunch landscapes find Pool to have a pretty weak appeal as an xp sink. This effect is exarberated by Pool inflation. Maybe consider making Pool points cheaper to compensate. Of course if it's working fine in play, then no problem - I'm used to thinking of Pool as a poor second choice in character development myself, anyway, so having it be even weaker isn't much of an issue. Some players seem to get trapped by their own choice of not ever getting more Pool, causing them to have more toys than fuel, but it's fair to think of this as the player's problem.<br/><br/>Reminds me of how I once sketched out a SS crunch landscape where you couldn't buy Pool points directly with Advances. Instead, you "leveled up" each time you sold a Key, made an Ability check and increased your Pool by the result (halving it on a failure just to fuck with players). No xp for the buyoff in this variant, of course, as you're getting Pool instead. Works well enough as a replacement for buying Pool with xp.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357765/#Comment_357765" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-04T11:41:05+00:00" title="February  4, 2012 11:41AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What kind of illustration work do you need?

Well, that's not necessarily universally true. Some character types have some cool moves that cost, like, 6 Pool. Those players might want to invest in a chance to do those moves twice. It's pretty powerful stuff, though, so I'm fine with that possibility costing four advances (eeek!)... So, yeah, it's the player's problem! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Todd, anything and everything will do. We can't afford to pay for the artwork, so we can't well be beggars <i>and</i> choosers... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> On the other hand, because we can't afford to pay for the art, we're naturally going to be very Ron-esque about it: whoever submits artwork for this will retain any and all copyrights to the art. In doesn't even have to be new stuff. If you've used it before in other projects, as long as it's still yours, we welcome it. All we require is the license to use it in this particular work, in whatever page and layout we choose, though recommendations are naturally welcome.<br/><br/>Also, anyone who submits credible* artwork immediately gets a full copy of the text as is (i.e. sans art), and if the artwork is actually used**, they get a free copy of the final PDF. It's only fair. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>J.<br/><br/>(*) "Credible" doesn't mean it's your bestest work ever. It just means it wasn't drawn by your eight-year-old niece and it wasn't drawn on a paper napkin while you were waiting for the subway, and stuff like that. It's seriously not going to be a problem, as long as people are reasonable, and in a place like this, I have full faith and confidence in that. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(**) Chances are it will get used, but whether it actually is depends on how much artwork we end up getting. Right now, the document stands at just over 30 A4 pages in Times New Roman 11. (That's somewhat similar to 8.5x11, for you yankees out there that are unaware of proper European paper sizes...;&gt; ) We're aiming to produce a 48-page booklet, or maybe a 64-pager in A5 with a slightly smaller typeface. (That's very close to the page size used in the Apocalypse World book.) I have no idea whether we'll be able to pull that off within a reasonable time frame.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JMendes" title="JMendes"><img alt="JMendes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pwp.netcabo.pt/0167757301/patch.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JMendes">JMendes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357814/#Comment_357814" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-04T19:38:50+00:00" title="February  4, 2012  7:38PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2012 7:38PM by JMendes.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Gah...
