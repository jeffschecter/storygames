What part of it makes it stand out from the rest of the components of the roleplaying game? The components that I've found are game mechanics, setting, the group, person, fiction, and meaning (emotional, social or philosophical explanation on why to play the game). The thesis I'm trying out is that a roleplaying game always have these components  - sometimes as silent agreements - and that they all can be dependent of each other. My thought is that game mechanics can create a setting but a setting can also create game mechanics. I've taken this way of thinking to see where I can take roleplaying game design. But what's in a player controlled character? Do you need one to play roleplaying games? I would say "no" on that question. You could make the fiction to be about a character but then the character would be part of the fiction. What part makes a personal character so unique that it can be treated as a component of it's own in a roleplaying game?<br/><br/>It's not the numbers on the character sheet, because that is part of the game mechanics.<br/><br/>It's not the background of the character, because that's part of the setting.<br/><br/>It's not the relationships that the character got, because that's also part of the setting.<br/><br/>It's not the player itself because ... well, it's pretty much what I mean with person.<br/><br/>It's not the character's actions, because that's part of the fiction.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Greg%20Pogor" title="Greg Pogor"><img alt="Greg Pogor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Greg%20Pogor">Greg Pogor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407068/#Comment_407068" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-24T04:58:08+00:00" title="February 24, 2013  4:58AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The sum of the things everybody said around the table counting as true about them, and the predictions you can make about their behavior based on those.<br/><br/>I mean, it's a Venn diagram thing, isn't it?

I eschew descriptions from the point of view of God. If a character is not there to experience the landscape in the opening of a scene, then there is no scene.<br/><br/>But that's me. My love of all this stuff is dramatic (tales told through the actions, words, and feelings of a character). This is why I like games that focus on Players with characters experiencing and creating the tale in the moment, am not very fond of Stakes Setting, like to have GMs in games (who create exterior events/stimulus for the Players/Characters to respond to and react to), and prefer games without personality bits of external behavior as bonuses that are mechanically and creatively fun but can also serve to cut a Player from digging into the Character to find the most interesting and compelling emotional and visceral response to events.<br/><br/>This is all personal choice, of course. I also tend to avoid games that are about characters puzzle solving and combat focused dungeon crawls. Some people like games built with a very top-down, Eye of God point of view. Not my cup of tea. But I can see the appeal.<br/><br/>So... Do you NEED Player controlled Characters? Nope. But for certain kinds of play--and certain kinds of enjoyment--they are crucial, if only to offer up the chance for one Player to really be responsible for and find the heartbeat of and speak for that Chracter with absolute authority and ownership. Otherwise the Character could be used to do what is "cool" or "best for the story" or something that leaves the character as dramatic and makes him or her only a tool to be used at the table.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407086/#Comment_407086" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-24T11:43:37+00:00" title="February 24, 2013 11:43AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps a Character is a point of view. A filter, if you will, of the world around them. But we're still left with the question " What shape does that filter take?"<br/><br/>A little creative experiment I just devised. Four players; one character who wakes up alone, in the dark, trapped, helpless.  Each player secretly decides who that character is and ascribes two non-physical characteristics/traits to the character related to the player's concept. The traits are in the form of (word) BUT (word). They need not be polar opposites. Now each player says thier word pair in turn and each following player must incorporate them into thier concept of the character. Let's see what character develops. I'll post the words first then a second post with the spoilers. <br/> <br/>Brave but Frightened<br/>Weak but Resourceful<br/>Loving but Negligent<br/>Selfish but Hopeful<br/><br/>I invite you to envision who this might be, as a character.

All sound and fury, signifying - nothing! <br/>  Well, I'm off to You-tube to watch the cat videos.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407152/#Comment_407152" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-24T23:18:16+00:00" title="February 24, 2013 11:18PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2013 9:14AM by Rickard.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like where this thread is going but here are some thoughts of my own.<br/><br/>Taken into account what people has written, especially about the Venn diagram, I start to realize that a character is just a pseudo-component that mostly exist as a result of other components added together. I think "group" is a pseudo-component as well, and I guess "session" is one too. I have no idea what to do with this information or what it means, but it seems like the character is a lens where all the data is processed and then thrown out as something different. If I apply this thinking on "group" and "session" it seems like they are lenses too. They take all the components of the game, process them and give out something that's changed.<br/><br/>I must say that I find this very interesting, and I never thought about this things in this way, but like I said: I don't know what I will do with this information. It would be interesting to look at the different parts of a character and see how they work as lenses - how the different parts together widen the possibility to interpret and how they make the person (player) interpret everything that happens.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I can develop what I mean with "meaning". It's basically why you play the game. You can invest emotionally in the game, by for example care about a character or invest in the situations that occur. You can play it to develop the social sphere, where you can deepen the relationship through understanding or sharing the same experience with the rest of the participants. You can also play it with a philosophical take - to answer moral questions, to see how things turn out or to question some of the structures in the society.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407175/#Comment_407175" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-25T09:06:24+00:00" title="February 25, 2013  9:06AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent.
