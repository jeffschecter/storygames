It was remarkably easy, but that's  not a surprise considering I babysat one day and they were almost playing D&amp;D without the rules. They made up all kinds of magical items in the span of a couple hours, including essentially recreating seven-league boots from imagination scratch.<br/><br/>Anyway, I hooked them with some basic "kill monsters and take their stuff" type play. But after talking with mom, she loves the idea of thornier problems with the possibility of talking as a real problem solving technique combined with freeform fallout. I am, of course talking about The Princes' Kingdom.<br/><br/>As near as I can tell, I can still buy a PDF of it. But mom wants to get to a point where she can run the game for her kids and she'd prefer having a physical copy of the book. I told her I'd see what I could do.<br/><br/>Does anybody have a copy they no longer need or want? If so, we'd be willing to pay something reasonable as well as shipping for it.<br/><br/>Thanks for any help!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363861/#Comment_363861" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T11:04:34+00:00" title="February 29, 2012 11:04AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/the-princes-kingdom/450515" rel="nofollow">Here you go</a>.<br/><br/>Use the checkout code LEARPYEAR305 and save 29% today only.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh_Unruh" title="Josh_Unruh"><img alt="Josh_Unruh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh_Unruh">Josh_Unruh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363867/#Comment_363867" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T11:09:46+00:00" title="February 29, 2012 11:09AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Jason!<br/><br/>I swear I looked before posting and somehow managed to miss it on Lulu.
