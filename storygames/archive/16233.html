The idea behind it was not to emulate Homestuck per se, but to emulate the storytelling style behind MSPA: a story where structured insanity is a guiding principle and nothing is forgotten for long. There was talk of a playtest but it never got off the ground.<br/><br/>Until now, of course!<br/><br/>Things to Know Upfront:\n<ul>\n<li>The game requires five participants. I will not be acting as GM.</li>\n<li>As mentioned above, this game has not been officially playtested (to my knowledge). This could run great, or it could burst into flames during the first session. We'll have to find out.</li>\n<li>I am usually at a computer between four and ten PM, Eastern US time.</li>\n<li>Please be patient with me. I have no experience organizing an online game.</li>\n</ul>\nThings to be Decided:\n<ul>\n<li>What's a time frame everyone will be online?</li>\n<li>How is this going to happen? Skype? Forum thread? Pesterchum?</li>\n</ul>\nAnd finally, a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KTcxdkhJdVZABP4lYy9uICu2iQJYhAW7qyPrEq3WYjQ/edit" rel="nofollow">the game itself.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Esoteric" title="Esoteric"><img alt="Esoteric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Esoteric">Esoteric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370307/#Comment_370307" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-31T15:26:30+00:00" title="March 31, 2012  3:26PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I like this!

The helper stuff is particularly clever.<br/><br/>I can recommend the IRC channels <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23playnow&amp;Mode=like">#playnow</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23indierpgs&amp;Mode=like">#indierpgs</a> on irc.magicstar.net as potentially good places both to find playtesters and hold playtests on. In fact, given how much of Homestuck is effectively instant messaging chats, I'd suggest a medium like that, as IRC is, as being one of the best ways to emulate that part of the form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
