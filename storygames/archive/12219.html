There wasn't any one particular scene I felt compelled to highlight in the bite-sized AP thread, but I've been thinking a lot about this game both before and after the session and wanted to jot down some things about it somewhere.<br/><br/>I really like the highlighted stats mechanic.  The GM and another player can think about the Fronts that are likely to unfold and what might be interesting if my character approached those Fronts a certain way.  In many games I'm not always sure what I want to do next and I find the starting point of "Sharp" and "Hot", for example, helpful to me in brainstorming what my Brainer might pursue for a scene.<br/><br/>This is the first game I've played in some years where I actually care about character advancement/XP.  Like, usually I can't even be bothered to track it no matter how simple it is.  You guys level up, I'm cool.  Or I'll do it, but I'm not really all that excited about it.  That includes Burning Wheel, TSoY, and 4E.  Usually I see/recognize designer carrots, smile to myself, and am just as happy to walk the other way in terms of those carrots affecting my mode of play.  I'm not exactly sure why it is that I care about it for AW so far.  Something to do with scarcity and ugly choices?  Maybe it's because my character is pretty vulnerable and I don't want her to lose big.<br/><br/>I like the tension that is present every time the dice are rolled.  Like I could choose to squeeze in a read the situation/person roll here to get an improvement circle but I better be damn sure I care about it because if I roll low, Christian is going to make a Move that my character will <i>not like</i>.  It's like the part of Stakes that I really like without having to go through all the actual Stakes-setting before you roll/draw, that part that sometimes makes me feel like I'm playing before I play.  All I need to know is that on one side I get what I want, and on the other is something I seriously do not want (but that will likely make the game more fun), and in the middle is some GM-fuckery that's supported by the rules/genre.  Perfect.<br/><br/>I see that Colin just did a bite-size on the session.  I'll add another bite to justify an AP category.<br/><br/>David's Savvyhead Gitch incurs what is likely to be the everlasting enmity of the Mongrels chopper gang.  He knocks one of them off their bike, commandeers it and then shoots out the front tire on two other bikes (my Brainer's brother on one of them).  He leads the rest of the gang on a merry chase, stranding them at the toxic tar pits.  This to save some pilgrim cultists the gang was intent on raiding, <i>some cultists he doesn't even know</i>.  "Bad karma, man." is the proffered reason.<br/><br/>Cut to a couple scenes later.  He's trying to talk H out of staying away from her pimp, Princey.  He's sussed out that Princey does <i>not</i> have her best interests in mind when it comes to the frightening Doghead.  So he (and all of we as players), know he's got to convince her or it's bad news for her.  Maybe a death sentence.  He lands in the 7-9 zone so she wants a promise that it'll be him and her forever.  He cares about her and says she can stay in his underground trailer as long as she wants but that he can't promise her that.  Note that AW's rules would have allowed him to promise that (lie) but not bind him if he didn't want that.  Stupid principles...  <br/><br/>I also enjoyed cracking my fellow players up by having Brace earnestly invite almost everyone she came into contact with to her upcoming "free movie night" on Friday, no matter how out of context the invitation.  Our hardhold, <a href="http://greenland.wikidot.com/" rel="nofollow">Greenland</a>, is coming apart at the seams.

Especially following a decision to highlight a useless or crippled stat.  Like, for example, when my brainer explicitly only seduces using Weird (due to a move) having Hot highlighted just meant that I was only improving on one stat.  Sure, I get that the other players wanted to see me Manipulate someone but since that just didn't jibe with how Iris worked, I felt ripped off and would, invariably, be left behind on the power curve.<br/><br/>It's an odd mechanic and one that I think we only really came to understand as the game came to a close.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273882/#Comment_273882" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T16:04:44+00:00" title="June  1, 2010  4:04PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2010 4:07PM by nemomeme.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>Maybe we were doing it wrong?</blockquote>Might not be what some would choose but I don't think you can screw things up that way if that's your group's flavor of fun.<br/><br/>Even if you push really hard and get to "level" every single session you play, the game doesn't look like it will break no matter how long you play, even with the expanded improvement rules.<br/><br/>If you're really good at something (+2), there's still a 16.7% chance of things going seriously pear-shaped every single time you roll.

It's doing it wrong if someone goes, "Holy shit, <i>really</i>?" and is not having fun. Just highlight something else and don't be an ass about it, is my way of thinking. It's not friggin' Agon.<br/><br/>Also, stealth is, almost always, doing something under fire. For cases where it isn't, then it isn't a move, probably. You just accomplish it, and done. Nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>I get what you mean about the embracing the Fail. That's cool. In my own experience with AW, though, PCs are nigh-unstoppable engines of utter badassitude.

Although, if the rules told me I couldn't highlight a stat until I introduced a custom move that used it, I'd be cool with that.<br/><br/>John, our discussion of stealth in AW was mainly about my dissatisfaction with it not being systematized. The move I wrote is an "infiltrate or steal" kind of stealth move, for when you use stealth to obtain something. You can get what you want, and you can get away clean. 10+ you get both, 7-9 you get one (you choose), 6 or less, you get none. When you don't "get what you want" that means you fail to obtain the item or information you were after, i.e. you can't steal the diamond or witness the cult ceremony. The GM will say what stops you. If you don't "get away clean" that means you are caught at the scene, you suffer harm, or you leave something behind, GM's choice.<br/><br/>You can, of course, make stealth rolls every time you want to sneak past guards while you explore the enemy camp, with "what you want" being "to sneak past the guards." And if there's something fucking awesome just past the, it's all cool, but if there isn't, then you are playing "explore the map" and not AW. You could, of course, make one roll with the "what you want" being "I get to explore the whole camp." And then you get to sneak around until something special happens (like you blow up the munitions shed or stumble upon the super-brainer psychic child).<br/><br/>The other reason for stealth is to ambush. The point here is either a) to actually get into a fight with somebody who otherwise won't let you (because they have a gun and you don't, or because they are inside a secure compound, etc), or b) to get a free hit on somebody instead of fighting with them. In which case, you can pretty much use the same system, but there's no guarantee of getting out again after the fight in a), and "getting away clean" in b) means your enemy can't retaliate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273900/#Comment_273900" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T17:14:53+00:00" title="June  1, 2010  5:14PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other player is supposed to highlight what they find interesting irrespective of whether there are some big fights coming up or they're trying to screw others' advancement, so it <i>is</i> wrong in that sense.<br/><br/>But it's safety-valved on one side by fast improvement not being a problem and it should be by the GM on the other side.  That was another feature I noticed and appreciated even though it's not an issue in our group - we look our for each other.  Even if there isn't a lot of trust/harmony between the players, the GM can say, "Man, Adam's Brainer is falling behind a little.  I'm gonna highlight his Weird and he can go psychic maelstrom and Weird seduction crazy."<br/><br/>Yeah, you'd have to have some pretty bad luck to fail regularly.  And if the player's characters work together (help) and are in their wheelhouse you could even be looking at a +4 with only a 2.8% (snake eyes) chance of things going horribly awry.<br/><br/>I wouldn't choose the phrase "loving/embracing the Fail" because teh intarwebs have loaded "Fail" incapable of nuance but I think I know what you mean, Adam.  Our group has been embracing the occasional protagonist setback for a long time now and we all seem to enjoy it whatever system we're using.  But Apocalypse World is really hitting a sweet spot for all of us on all kinds of levels.  Most of our games go a little dark now and then - it's like we were waiting for Apocalypse World and it's just clicked for us really quickly.  I wish we could play more.<br/><br/>John: No custom moves yet - still getting our bearings.

Especially following a decision to highlight a useless or crippled stat.  Like, for example, when my brainer explicitly only seduces using Weird (due to a move) having Hot highlighted just meant that I was only improving on one stat.  Sure, I get that the other players wanted to see me Manipulate someone but since that just didn't jibe with how Iris worked, I felt ripped off and would, invariably, be left behind on the power curve.<br/><br/>It's an odd mechanic and one that I think we only really came to understand as the game came to a close.<br/><br/>Okay, that I can call wrong. In our group, if you end up with moves that change what stats you use (so, for example, you don't have anything that uses Hot like my Driver), you can't have that stat highlighted. I drew a big ol' X through the Hot highlight box, just so everyone knew.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273904/#Comment_273904" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T17:36:23+00:00" title="June  1, 2010  5:36PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've avoided trying to find out what AW since I first saw it being spoken about.

Like "Prim's hidden his stash somewhere in the tent? I'm gonna try to find it." I made more than a few custom "Uh, roll +sharp" moves on the spot for my one Face to face playtest, let me tell you. In hindsight, though, I could have just asked "Okay, where in Prim's tent are you looking?" and then made a move like offering them an opportunity, with or without a cost, telling them the possible consequences and asking, or just saying what happened while they were searching. But I liked some of the sharp moves I came up with, and the scavenging-in-the-ruins one I posted in the ecretsay ogblay seemed to be popular, so that's cool.<br/><br/>Highlighting stats is a bit "meta", if you mean what I think you mean, but it's really the only "meta" the PCs have to worry about. Hx stats might be a bit of jump especially if they're highly "trad", but just say "How well you know Bob's character is just another stat, like how hard or how sharp you are", and that should be fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273920/#Comment_273920" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T18:58:06+00:00" title="June  1, 2010  6:58PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2010 7:08PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>we would tag each others' Hard stat.</blockquote>\nWe would? The only metagaming concerns I remember strongly impacting my choices were 'can the character actually use this stat at all' -- or for example your saying repeatedly that you had no interest in your character being Hot, ever. So while some stats were excluded I don't remember ever picking a stat because I knew someone would have an opportunity to use it more than usual next session. I picked what I wanted to see -- other concerns sometimes limited the set I could choose from, but the choice itself wasn't about advancement.<br/><br/>And like someone said, the game (to my mind) does a pretty good job with lots of open-ended advancement. We played thirteen or so sessions and I think I racked up 10+ advancements -- I sure did have a lot of moves, and I changed roles right at the end -- and I was just starting to run up against the 'there's not much left to buy' wall. But that's when you switch characters, or get a second one if you aren't done with the first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273926/#Comment_273926" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T19:21:26+00:00" title="June  1, 2010  7:21PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just food for thought: while "interesting" is left to the player to define, "Which stat do you find the most interesting?" is technically a different question than "which of my stats do you want highlighted?"

I tried both IAWA and Poison'd and couldn't really get them to work for me, but AW is something else and, in fact, has made me better able to understand what Vincent was getting at in those other games.  I'm actually excited to go back, re-read, and play them now.<br/><br/>That said, AW is not necessarily easy to run, especially if you have a lot of traditional or indie brain damage.  It's super easy to PLAY, as long as somebody else is running it well, but it takes a somewhat fundamental shift in thinking to correctly implement even basic concepts like "when to roll dice," especially when running it for others.  Vincent is very good about laying these principles out in the text; but it's one thing to read them, nod your head, and say "Yeah, man, YEAH...."  and another to actually remember to do it that way at the table.  I've been playing the game for a couple months now with Harper (who gets it 98% and is great at explaining his approach) and I still feel like I'm gonna fuck it up all over the place when I run it for the first time. Still, I know that I'll HAVE to run it at some point in order to learn how to run it properly and internalize a lot of the lessons and approaches that the game delivers.<br/><br/>Maybe your experience won't be like that.  John says that the game gave him formal guidelines for the way that he already ran games.  I think that's somewhat true for me as well, especially when it comes to Fronts, but the degree to which AW really wants you to abandon the idea of challenging players or creating situations and just <i>follow the fucking fiction and say what happens</i> still throws me for a loop every so often.  I know the game is about that, and yet I still clutch to my precious little ideas about how to structure play around resolution, rather than trusting that I can just say what happens.<br/><br/>So that's my conclusion: AW is the best and most important indie game -- and that probably means the best and most important game period -- in a long, long time, even including the glorious awesomeness that is Mouse Guard.  I mean, most likely the Adventure Burner will come out this summer and Luke will continue to push the envelop as we know he will, so he and Vincent will remain neck and neck in pushing and demanding that the hobby move forward. But until then, AW is the cutting edge right now.  It's that good.<br/><br/>Whether you want to pick it up and try to run it for your friends, that's another question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273938/#Comment_273938" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T20:55:05+00:00" title="June  1, 2010  8:55PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

There is no direct responsibility to the players in terms of content, except insofar as their characters are the focus of the fiction.<br/><br/>It may be that there is some subtle implementation of player flagging that I have not noticed (besides the aforementioned stat-highlighting), but I think the only way a player flags something as interesting to them is by having their character take action relating to it in the fiction. There's no in-advance, GM-should-prep-a-bang-around-this sort of thing. It's just that the GM starts creating the <i>whole world</i> out of and around the characters, so it's hard to get too far from the mark if you stick to the Fronts, because Fronts are <i>descriptive</i> of something that already revealed itself in the fiction. Your character in its entirety is your flag, because your character drives the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273945/#Comment_273945" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T21:40:14+00:00" title="June  1, 2010  9:40PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2010 9:44PM by jenskot.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So the GM prep, Fronts, are designed around the PCs?

Or actually, 'designed around' is pretty misleading -- that's the kind of trap that I think Jonathan was talking about, above. It suggests an intent towards the characters that is not really necessary (and could just get in the way.) More accurately, the Fronts are descriptive of the fiction, and the fiction is centered around the PCs. The first session starts with the GM kind of following the PCs around, asking lots of questions about their lives and the people around them, looking for problems. Some of these questions are put to the players, some of them are kind of the GM asking themselves 'oh, what about this?' and writing those questions down. All of these answers and the NPCs that appear in this initial walkabout are what the GM uses to create the initial Fronts. (The GM is not passive, here, but the GM is taking actions in response to their general apocalyptic vision of the world.)<br/><br/>This is what I meant by them being descriptive (as opposed to prescriptive) -- the Front comes <i>after</i> something in the fiction happens to make the GM go 'oh hey, that looks like it could be part of a larger problem'. The GM will then flesh that out on their own, but it starts from something that is already there. Fronts that are created later on follow the same pattern -- they arise out of interactions and events that are already in the fiction. There should never be a point where the GM is like 'oh damn, there's nothing going on, I better <i>create an introduce a new Front</i>' -- if the GM needs more Fronts she should go looking for them in the fiction, just like in the first session. Creating a Front in a vaccuum is a bad idea; the reverse of that is since all the Fronts are created out of the fiction, they all must necessarily relate to the PCs. Because the fiction is about these characters. The whole game is just following these characters around, seeing what they do (and don't do), and how the world reacts to what they do (and don't do.)<br/><br/>There is nothing comparable to assigning relationship dice -- a clear, outside-the-fiction mechanical marker of interest -- though I suppose the player could also be like 'oh hey, my character <i>knows that guy</i>'. But more likely the AW equivalent would simply be for the PC to start getting involved in that person's life, by doing stuff. The thing about Dogs is that getting involved in somebody's business is the default -- it's part of what it means to be a Dog -- so that Relationship Die is more important, because it's like 'I'm not just doing this because it's part of the town'. In AW the default action is to let people suffer and deal with their own damn problems -- so if your character starts dealing with other people's problems, that's a pretty strong indicator that there is some interest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273961/#Comment_273961" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T23:20:39+00:00" title="June  1, 2010 11:20PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnskot, I was talking to Harper (trying to keep my Johns distinct) about that this afternoon, more or less.<br/><br/>One of the parts that's going to be hard for me is that AW really tells the GM to basically stop paying super close attention to the players and what they want.  That's metagame bullshit, as far as AW is concerned, at least most of the time.  If you, as GM, are paying attention to the players, rather than the characters and what the players say the characters actually do, you're gonna fuck it all up.  You can't do that magical GM trick where you give the players what they want but didn't know or weren't allowed to ask for.  You can't challenge the players the way they like to be challenged.  None of that.  Fuck what the players want.  If they really want something, they should have their characters do something about it; then you, as the GM, can respond.  You can't respond to things that haven't happened yet, fictionally, because the fiction drives everything.<br/><br/>There aren't flags in the normal sense, then, at least not as a major thing.  Instead what happens is something a bit like the GM spending danger in Danger Patrol, if you've played that.  In Danger Patrol, the GM only gets to attack the players when they roll danger, which the GM spends to hurt them or make bad things happen as a result of their roll.  AW does something similar, where the GM gets to make moves when players fail rolls... which means that the GM's move is always directly related to something a character was trying to do.  This leads to a similar alignment of GM/player actions, as if the GM was hitting particular flags, but without the GM having to do all that meta tracking of player desires.  The GM also gets to make a move in a few other critical cases: when the players create the perfect opportunity, when the players allow the GM's plans to come together unchallenged, and a few others.  But the GM is basically reacting to what the players do, at least until there's a pause in the game and everybody's looking for the GM to say something (which is also one of the instances in which you're allowed to make a GM move).<br/><br/>The GM also doesn't call for rolls.  The players decide when they are making a particular move and then roll.  Those are the only circumstances under which you roll dice (though maybe the new Harm rules add a qualifier).  I keep having discussions about this with Harper, because it's somewhat strange to wrap your head around, in the same way as "Say Yes" in the beginning.  Imagine this example, from Dead Weight:<br/><br/>HARPER: "You're running from the zombies in the downpour and make it to the rain-slicked roof of the old warehouse."<br/>(He's following the fiction here, making the world real, and explicitly NOT setting up a conflict.)<br/><br/>JAYWALT: "Uh, shit, I skate across it in my sneakers, trying to maintain my momentum without totally skidding off the edge."<br/>(I'm following the fiction too, but I've -- perhaps inadvertently -- invoked some of the mechanics here by describing the roof as an obstacle I'm attempting to overcome, something I didn't necessarily have to do.)<br/><br/>HARPER: "So, you're 'Acting Under Fire'?"<br/>(He thinks I've declared a move without necessarily realizing it; he's NOT telling me to roll dice, necessarily; the question is a sincere one, making sure we're on the same page about what the fictional action I've just described means mechanically.)<br/><br/>JAYWALT: "Crap, hmm, maybe.  It sounds like it, doesn't it?"<br/>(Here we are building consensus about whether the fiction triggers a specific mechanic.)<br/><br/>HARPER: "That's what I thought I heard you say."<br/>(One of the GM's jobs is to listen for when a player is making a move, which is a pretty different task than telling them to roll or setting up conflicts.  Basically, you listen for situations when <i>something the player has already said their character is doing</i> is one of the "when X" conditions that require a roll.  You do this rather than specifically making those situations happen, instead letting them arise 'naturally' from the fictional events.)<br/><br/>JAYWALT: "Hmm, I'm gonna spend my remaining advance and take the 'Steady Feet' special move which allows me to easily cross any precarious surface."<br/>(I choose another action, this time a mechanical one but it could be fictional as well -- whipping out a grappling hook, for example -- that doesn't require a roll.)<br/><br/>HARPER: "Awesome.  Yeah, so you totally slide right across the roof, barely loosing any speed."<br/>(Not rolling is totally fine with John; this isn't a conflict, he has no investment in any particular outcome, and so I can totally choose to do something else.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273963/#Comment_273963" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T23:55:47+00:00" title="June  1, 2010 11:55PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anyone know when the final version is coming out?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273965/#Comment_273965" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-02T00:44:43+00:00" title="June  2, 2010 12:44AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2010 1:55AM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading this threat is helping me to understand what I do when I run AW. Because, honestly, I don't think about it to much. It's like a Zen thing: I feel the game in my mind, I just can't think about it. Things like: <i>"Follow the fiction and say what happens"</i> is spot on. I, like Harper, feel that AW has codified and made explicit shit I was always trying to do with other games. But I didn't have Fronts, so I'd stats up a bunch of NPCs, a relationship map and write on line about what each of them wanted.

Walton</cite>One of the parts that's going to be hard for me is that AW really tells the GM to basically stop paying super close attention to the players and what they want.  That's metagame bullshit, as far as AW is concerned, at least most of the time.  If you, as GM, are paying attention to the players, rather than the characters and what the players say the characters actually do, you're gonna fuck it all up.  You can't do that magical GM trick where you give the players what they want but didn't know or weren't allowed to ask for.  You can't challenge the players the way they like to be challenged.  None of that.  Fuck what the players want.  If they really want something, they should have their characters do something about it; then you, as the GM, can respond.  You can't respond to things that haven't happened yet, fictionally, because the fiction drives everything.</blockquote>\nThis sounds great for proactive players. What about people who are reactive? \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>There aren't flags in the normal sense, then, at least not as a major thing.  Instead what happens is something a bit like the GM spending danger in Danger Patrol, if you've played that.  In Danger Patrol, the GM only gets to attack the players when they roll danger, which the GM spends to hurt them or make bad things happen as a result of their roll.  AW does something similar, where the GM gets to make moves when players fail rolls... which means that the GM's move is always directly related to something a character was trying to do.  This leads to a similar alignment of GM/player actions, as if the GM was hitting particular flags, but without the GM having to do all that meta tracking of player desires.</blockquote>\nThat sounds like how we've been <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11960" rel="nofollow">playing Shadowrun</a>. We decided to strip out most of the GM rules management and focused on giving the GM more flexibility in reacting to the players. The GM focuses on the fiction and the players do all the rolling. Glitches give the GM currency to make moves against the players but it all comes from the player's actions in the fiction. <br/><br/>Which works amazingly for us when the players are invested. How does AW build investment? <br/><br/>Do the PCs have things they want or care about? Are they blank slates when they start playing? How are they tied to the world? \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

Walton</cite>But the GM is basically reacting to what the players do, at least until there's a pause in the game and everybody's looking for the GM to say something (which is also one of the instances in which you're allowed to make a GM move).</blockquote>\nAh cool, this may solve issues with less proactive players. What sort of GM moves apply here? Please tell me more.

The first session starts with the GM kind of following the PCs around, asking lots of questions about their lives and the people around them, looking for problems. Some of these questions are put to the players, some of them are kind of the GM asking themselves 'oh, what about this?' and writing those questions down. All of these answers and the NPCs that appear in this initial walkabout are what the GM uses to create the initial Fronts. </blockquote>\nCool! How does this work? Is there a list of questions for the GM to ask the PCs? Do the PCs free form narrate a typical day in their character's lives? Is this all present day narration? \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>This is what I meant by them being descriptive (as opposed to prescriptive) -- the Front comes<i>after</i>something in the fiction happens to make the GM go 'oh hey, that looks like it could be part of a larger problem'. The GM will then flesh that out on their own, but it starts from something that is already there. Fronts that are created later on follow the same pattern -- they arise out of interactions and events that are already in the fiction. There should never be a point where the GM is like 'oh damn, there's nothing going on, I better<i>create an introduce a new Front</i>' -- if the GM needs more Fronts she should go looking for them in the fiction, just like in the first session. Creating a Front in a vaccuum is a bad idea; the reverse of that is since all the Fronts are created out of the fiction, they all must necessarily relate to the PCs. Because the fiction is about these characters. The whole game is just following these characters around, seeing what they do (and don't do), and how the world reacts to what they do (and don't do.)</blockquote>\nThis sounds great. I'm trying to imagine how this works. Some of my friends don't require a lot of inspiration and will just start saying what their characters are doing, creating fiction for the GM to build a Front from. But a lot of my friends are much more passive. Does AW have tools for teasing fiction out of them? So far it sounds like AW does have informal flags but they are created in play.

On flags though -  I don't have the playtest document with me but there are mechanics where the player makes a move and the GM gets to ask the character questions.  Opening your brain to the psychic maelstrom is one of these but I there are others.  These facilitate GM/Player communication in the same way flags do, but more actively and they generate fiction and color.<br/><br/>Something maybe really obvious: Apocalypse World has what I think are one of the best flags of all: character classes.  A classic concept that you don't see often in this community.  I think they're great, and they're well-implemented in this design.<br/><br/>You asked about a specific example from our play of the "follow the fiction" that JWalt referenced.  I'm not sure I understand what he was getting at there.  Something parallel that maybe touches on that that I keep seeing is that fiction is constantly generated by the moves the players make, basic and custom, particularly when a 9 or less is the dice result.  And the game calls out very specific moves the GM gets to make in response to many of these.  It is very rigorous/exacting in this regard and I have the impression that it will make it very easy and fun to run; I won't know for sure until I do.<br/><br/>edit: crosspost!

They are all totally fictional things with no mechanics for doing them, though Vincent does describe them a bit better.  You just narrate them into the fiction and the players have to do things -- which sometimes requires making moves -- in order to respond.  That's how you get more reactive players to do things, by making hard moves directed at them or the things they care about.  Eventually, some of them may step up and decide to take a more proactive stance to do something about it.<br/><br/>- Separate them<br/>- Put someone in a spot<br/>- Offer an opportunity, with or without a cost<br/>- Tell them the possible consequences and ask<br/>- Inflict harm (as established)<br/>- Trade harm for harm<br/>- Announce future badness<br/>- Announce off-screen badness<br/>- Take away their stuff<br/>- Invoke scarcity and want<br/>- Activate their stuff's downside<br/>- Make a custom threat move [these come from your Fronts]<br/><br/>Sledge's booming voice threatening a character is probably "announce future badness."  He's about to come through the door and hit you with a hammer.  What do you do? If the GM says he comes through the door swinging, without announcing his arrival, that could be "put someone in a spot."  The GM gets to choose the move that he thinks is most appropriate, given the current state of the fiction, or the one he most wants to see, or the one that allows him to set up a future move.<br/><br/>As for "perfect opportunity" and "plans coming to fruition without opposition" I can't tell you more because those are the exact rules.  There's no more than that!  You as GM get to decide when those things happen and when that means you get to make a move.<br/><br/>Everybody seems to have issues with Hx (history, the character relationship stat) and it's being houseruled all over the place.  Personally, I like being able to take Hx with NPCs -- which isn't really in the rules -- and then adjusting 1 PC and 1 NPC Hx after each session.  Harper pointed out that that's basically a custom move, though: "When you want to take Hx with an NPC...."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274024/#Comment_274024" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-02T09:40:27+00:00" title="June  2, 2010  9:40AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>we would tag each others' Hard stat.</blockquote>\nWe would?

Our style definitely appears to be statements along the lines of "I want to see Snargle get even more wrapped up in the maelstrom, so let's go with Sharp" (he's got Weather Eye). There's elements of what the character's good at, what we think will happen in the session, and what we think is cool. 'Interesting' is a good shorthand for all those things, but I we don't really aim for 'interesting.'                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274032/#Comment_274032" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-02T10:12:17+00:00" title="June  2, 2010 10:12AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>Hold on, hold on, hold on.

With the exception of the 5-player session we played recently, we easily get 2x or 3x our "normal" dose of fiction when playing AW.  Did you have 4 or 5 players?<br/><br/>John, players can't create NPCs or objects instantly, because one of the core themes of the game is scarcity.  There's a very tightly restricted amount of stuff (though always plenty of bullets) and there's actually, as far as I know, a very strict list of names from which the GM can create and name NPCs, basically implying -- without outright saying it -- that there's a limited number of people -- or, at least, named, specific NPCs -- in the world.  Sure, the player can say, "I go find a local medic/science dude."  And the GM can say, "Great, the best person you can think of is... (scans list)... Torq (crosses name off).  You've known her for about six months, ever since she rolled in with that chopper gang. You're gonna go see her?  She definitely knows a LOT of things about poisoning people."  Or if the players want stuff they don't have, they have to go find people who have them and barter or work for them.<br/><br/>Fictional descriptions in AW don't make you better or worse at things, but they can change what move it is that you're doing, which effectively does the same thing.  Since the moves you make derive from what's happening in the fiction, the details of the fiction are super important. You're gonna have better stats in some areas and therefore prefer to make certain kinds of moves if you want to succeed.  However, there will also be some instances where you will feel inclined to Act Under Fire or Manipulate people even if you're bad at that.  Sometimes you will want to do a specific move, like "I Go Aggro on him!" and its the GM's job to ask "Okay, how do you do that?" because that's not something in the fiction yet.  And you may say "I beat the snot out of him with an axe handle for challenging my authority!" But the GM could respond: "So are you focused on causing him pain and harm or on making sure your still have the authority in this gang?" So it may turn out that, according to what you want to do in the fiction, what you want isn't really to Go Aggro, it's to Seize With Force (the authority).<br/><br/>Attacking 1 person and attacking a group (say, a "small gang," since that's a mechanically measured unit of people) is the exact same roll with the exact same difficulty.  But a small gang is a lot tougher than a single person (they can take more Harm) and also can inflict a lot more Harm on you than a person can, unless that person is armed with a grenade launcher or has some crazy special move, like the already infamous NOT TO BE FUCKED WITH (which is apparently always written in all caps and makes a character the equivalent of a small gang).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274076/#Comment_274076" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-02T12:38:11+00:00" title="June  2, 2010 12:38PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnskot, I was just chatting with Harper a bit, and we both now think I'm overstating it a bit as far as the moves deriving completely from the fiction.  Sometimes moves derive from OOC things as well, like how you're supposed to moonlight on your various gigs (basically, go work jobs) "when there's downtime in the game."  Following the fiction holds true for the overall game more than it does for every specific move.  Some moves are invoked by a mixture of fictional, OOC, and mechanical things.  Like there's a new move for "when you take Harm" which is both a fictional and mechanical thing at the same time.<br/><br/>Just don't want to overstate my case here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274080/#Comment_274080" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-02T12:45:40+00:00" title="June  2, 2010 12:45PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2010 12:49PM by sage.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A clarification on Walton's point: one of the GM's jobs is to make NPCs seem like people, give them names. So really the only nameless people are crowds or window dressing (the bounty hunters hanging around the job board, assuming the PCs don't talk to them, for instance). I might say that the list of names implicitly says there's only so many people who are personally important to the story, and nameless hordes who can be important only in the abstract.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274084/#Comment_274084" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-02T12:49:51+00:00" title="June  2, 2010 12:49PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>assuming the PCs don't talk to them, for instance</blockquote>\nWhy would we?

These included how our characters earn barter to pay for the things we need, what kinds of things are difficult for us to get, whether we're sleeping with anyone currently, how often, what's the nature of that relationship, etc?  Lots of other questions too.  Some of these questions establish the fundamental nature of scarcity in Apocalypse World.  Some might suggest things that are important to the PCs, things they might care about.<br/><br/>I don't remember what's in the rules on the subject of location/people creation.  Maybe different groups are doing that differently?  Christian asked me where I find my brother and I said The Dog Pit.  Maybe some more reactive groups wouldn't be comfortable with that but I think Apocalypse World can be run by a GM that covers most of the traditional roles of a GM.  From my recollection of the text and from the way we did it, though, the default mode of first session is pretty much the players creating the world in response to the MoC's questions.  But scarcity definitely means the MoC is going to say, "Uh, yeah, no on that.  Here's how that works..."<br/><br/>A data point on how much plot got covered in our AW fiction.  Maybe as much in the first two sessions as in any other game we've played together before?  Some of our PTA sessions have had about as much go down.  The whole hardhold power structure has been turned upside down and each of the characters lives have changed dramatically.  Gitch has, through his actions, gained enemies in two different factions.  Phoenix has been shot twice on two consecutive days.  We've all either read/manipulated/seduced or gone aggro on at least a couple NPCs each and are dealing with the fallout from that.  No status quos in Apocalypse World.  Things are moving dizzyingly fast.<br/><br/>Things really busted out this session but we may have actually done <i>too</i> much in the first session relative to what the game text advises.  Part of that may reflect that we can often only get together about every three weeks so we're always hungry for forward momentum.  Part is probably story games brain damage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274088/#Comment_274088" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-02T12:55:57+00:00" title="June  2, 2010 12:55PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds like fighting a group is hard because they can take and inflict more Harm.

Some might suggest things that are important to the PCs, things they might care about.</blockquote>\nThat's pretty cool! <br/><br/>Is there a GM sheet of some sort to keep track of all these details?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274091/#Comment_274091" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-02T13:02:04+00:00" title="June  2, 2010  1:02PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for the NPC thing, it's in the principles, isn't it: <i>Name everyone, make everyone human.</i> There's no limit to NPCs but they should all have simple and straight forward self-interested wants and needs, and this is important, that involve a players' characters individually, but not the group as a whole.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274094/#Comment_274094" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-02T13:06:21+00:00" title="June  2, 2010  1:06PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Things that aren't measured mechanically, like in the Harm they can do, are measured by their fictional consequences (a nuke probably doesn't even deal Harm, for example, it probably just has the fictional consequence of.. well, everything that happens when you set off a nuke: instant death, fallout, giant cloud, etc.).<br/><br/>Also, you're still thinking about the mechanics and not about the fiction.<br/><br/>YOU: I'm gonna build a nuke.<br/>GM: Great.

In that sense, it's just like Basic D&amp;D or a similar game: you say what you do, the GM says what happens. If it "happens in the fiction", then you've got your nuke. But there's no way to know whether a) it's possible at all, or b) how "difficult" it is. It's just up to the GM.<br/><br/>Although the "reading" moves and a couple of the other moves (like manipulating people through seduction) do increase the range of what mechanics cover, they're mostly for stuff like <br/>fighting and threatening people. Each "class" also has its own moves, though, for the stuff that it can do, so if you're a guy who can build a car, there's a specific move you can look up and use.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>Some moves are invoked by a mixture of fictional, OOC, and mechanical things.  Like there's a new move for "when you take Harm" which is both a fictional and mechanical thing at the same time.<br/></blockquote>\nAlso right. When I played it, there was a lot of "I want to roll dice to make this move!" And then we'd have to remember to say, "whoa, wait! How are you doing that?" I'm not sure what about the design (if anything) keeps you from forgetting to do that, though--anyone?<br/><br/>I'm really curious about the "when you take Harm" move. Because in the playtest version it was super old school: PCs all have six hit points, NPCs all have three hit points. And that seemed like a missed opportunity for something cool, even though you could reduce your stats in exchange for avoiding death once you got to the bottom of those hit points.<br/><br/>I remember the whole "healing" business, and whether/how much injuries hampered you felt very old-school, too: "Here's your hit points. When do they heal? When the GM decides enough time has passed." "Do they hamper you in any way?"

Or at least, the conversations we were having at that point were leading me to believe it. </blockquote>\nAh, well yes of course. But the expected fiction is part of how you decide 'what I want to see this character do' -- it's not about advancement, particularly. I often thought 'well there is probably going to be a fight coming up, so I will highlight the Brainer's crappy Hard to try and egg Adam into even more slapstick grenade-mishandlings' -- but I didn't think 'well there is probably going to be a fight coming up, so I will highlight the Brainer's crappy Hard so at least he gets some advances out of all the inevitable violence that I don't care about either way.'<br/><br/>-\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>I remember the whole "healing" business, and whether/how much injuries hampered you felt very old-school, too: "Here's your hit points. When do they heal? When the GM decides enough time has passed."</blockquote>\nThere are specific rules about stabilization and what degree of injury is recoverable with time, etc. But yes, for the first two hit points it works something like that. I played an Angel in our campaign and I basically never healed the last point of injury on anybody -- let them suffer it out for a day or two! <br/><br/>On the same topic, I had a pretty ambivalent reaction to the incredibly detailed list of medical supplies, each of which heals different segments or performs other related, <i>very specific</i> effects. On some level I appreciated how the attention to detail really pinpointed that feeling of scarcity -- our game was pretty low on scarcity in general, but seeing the angel kit stuff in action kind of gave me a glimpse of a very different way to play the game. At the same time, it got a little handwavey by the end (you find... some medical stuff! whatever!) and I don't think the <i>very specific</i> scarcity of medical supplies ever came into play in a super meaningful way. My character's general need to find more medical supplies came up fairly often, though, and it shaped the fiction on a general level in some ways.<br/><br/>-\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>Adam, I have no idea how you played that long and had so little happen in the fiction</blockquote>\nI just wanted to suggest, here, that Adam might be confusing 'not a lot happened' with 'not a lot of time passed.' We had zero downtime in our game -- leading me to speculate about the difference between AW with or without an Operator -- but I would say that rather a lot happened, fictionally. After all, the density of the fiction -- even constrained by the basic unit of 'moves' -- is pretty elastic. (Of course, I come from a background of games where resolving a single interpersonal conflict might take thirty hours of gameplay, so maybe my viewpoint is unconsciously skewed.) There were definitely slow patches -- our group (by which I mean me) likes to talk a lot about the fictional context of everything -- but there was no wasted fiction, from my point of view.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274160/#Comment_274160" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-02T17:38:27+00:00" title="June  2, 2010  5:38PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The new Harm rules are really great.

"We had a hard conversation" vs. "we blew up the other guys' house" though, at the end, that had its place, too.  <br/><br/>I still have mixed feelings about the highlighting process.  I designed my character with the idea that he wasn't Hard and wasn't Hot and every time I had a stat highlighted that didn't jibe with my character concept, it became a game of using the stat and acting "out of character" to get advancements or just playing Iris the way I saw him and not advancing.  It was a weird sort of reversal of what I'd come to expect from games (be your dude.  get rewarded.)

But I can also appreciate having mixed feeling about or even flat out hating it.<br/><br/>I picture highlighting as acting something akin to PTA's Fan Mail in most groups over the course of multiple sessions: "Oh, man, it is so beyond awesome when Adam's Brainer opens his mind to the maelstrom and he describes what he sees there!  I'm totally going to highlight Weird again."

I think the game assumes that you are interested in all your character's stats, high or low -- or that you at least have an understanding of what it looks like for your character to try and use those moves. It took awhile for you to communicate that your attitude towards your character not being Hot was one of total disinterest -- I just assumed that his lack of Hotness was as interesting a part of his character as how Weird or Cool he was. Same with his not being Hard (and I never got the same sense from you about Hard as Hot, which we eventually just stopped highlighting at all.) When I first highlighted Iris' Hot it seemed really obvious to me all the things you could try to do in order to get advances (try to score with random characters, fail to manipulate people, etc.) -- they didn't seem like out of character things to do at all. Obviously you have a better grip on that, but to be honest it still confuses me a little. There's not that many moves in the game and writing some of them off as 'my character wouldn't do that' seems like you're kind of shooting yourself in the foot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274383/#Comment_274383" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-03T16:40:00+00:00" title="June  3, 2010  4:40PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2010 4:40PM by John_Harper.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks like AW is doing that thing that some indie games do sometimes.

These are all issues we resolved during our actual sessions through player communication. The Brainer's Hot stat was not, that I recall, ever highlighted past the sixth or so session, once it became clear that Adam was actively disinterested in using his Hot moves (and even without that, by that point he had bought the substitute-weird-for-hot-for-seduction move, so it was an even less reasonable choice.) Before that I don't think it was highlighted more than twice. <br/><br/>The issues we are discussing about the game are things that occured somewhere in the beginning/middle of our campaign, and which to my mind at least we mostly resolved as a group by the last half-dozen sessions. <br/><br/>But what we ended up doing is not how the game describes highlighted stats. It is not supposed to be about what the player of the character wants, after all -- that's why the player of the character doesn't choose what stat to highlight on their own character. The game does not describe how you should constrain your choices based on what the other player wants, and while a baseline 'oh no you don't' social veto makes sense as a matter of course, in our case it took several sessions of 'well let's try it' before players started to feel comfortable saying 'wait a sec, this really isn't working.' If you think this is somehow the fault of our group's poor communication, well, I can only shrug.<br/><br/>As Johnstone pointed out, the game text pretty explicitly advises the GM to choose low stats and/or Weird in default of any other preference -- it basically advises the exact behaviour that caused our frustration, and then <i>required additional communication on our part</i> to resolve (by essentially overruling the advice.) Trying to spin this as the game 'shining a spotlight' on some sort of group dysfunction seems kind of silly -- from my point of view it would be more accurate to say that the game made us do more work than necessary to achieve a workable result. Hopefully the final version of the game will include some further advice in that section.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274392/#Comment_274392" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-03T18:28:47+00:00" title="June  3, 2010  6:28PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the end of our 14 sessions this wasn't an issue, because we highlighted stats based on what moves characters would use them for, not on the description of the stat itself. Adam consistently refused to use Hot, so we stopped highlighting it.<br/><br/>There was one thing I noticed: I could introduce custom moves that used a stat whose only move had been replaced (Daniel used sharp for the maelstrom), and then highlight that stat to encourage a player to engage with that custom move. But my custom moves were mostly there to make the psychic bad-guys more bad-ass, so the players tried to avoid them.<br/><br/>You should be able to highlight barter, I think.

In my mind, those instructions have the purpose of <i>giving you Keys for doing things that will complicate the game</i>.  Doing things you're less good at or rolling Weird always makes the game more interesting, in my experience, because it creates complications or exposes new information.  If you're gonna ignore the Keys the other players chose for you... well, clearly you need different Keys, right?  That's what you do in TSOY: buy off your old Keys and get new ones.  Which is basically what it sounded like you did.<br/><br/>In AW though, as a player you don't get to decide which areas of your character are the ones in which they need to grow or exhibit character development; the other players do that.  I don't think that makes things harder, inherently.

Namely, that people ended up with stats highlighted that they were resistant to using at all (or in some cases, literally could not use at all.) So far consensus in this thread seems to be that if a player feels a highlighted stat is inappropriate to the point of frustration, they should communicate this and the other players should avoid highlighting the stat. This is, in fact, what happened in our game -- but only after a period of frustration where we followed the rules and advice of the game more closely.<br/><br/>As you say, the game is structured so that you do not get input into which of your stats are highlighted -- and therefore which parts of your character you are being encouraged to develop. Personally, I like that, and I only had problems when I had highlighted stats that I literally could not use (because I had purchased moves that made them obsolete) -- but Adam was frustrated because he ended up with highlighted stats that he felt would require him to act "out of character" in order to use. In other words, there was an (unvoiced, at first) disagreement about whether it was <i>feasible at all</i> for him to develop the character in that area.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>If you're gonna ignore the Keys the other players chose for you... well, clearly you need different Keys, right?</blockquote>\nI am really unclear how this and the sentences around it relate to what you were saying, overall. As you say, when players ended up not using stats at all the other players eventually stopped highlighting those stats, because clearly that wasn't working out. But this does not match up with the way the game is designed, as far as I can tell -- it certainly does not match up with your second paragraph. If the 'point' is that other players get to choose "which areas of your character are the ones in which they need to grow or exhibit... development" then ignoring the highlighted stat is, presumably, 'playing it wrong', or at the very least it suggests some kind of problem with the implementation. If a character/player can legitimately decline to have their character develop in one or more areas -- which again, seems to be the consensus of everyone in the discussion so far -- then that should probably be addressed in the advice around the rules. <br/><br/>I have no problem with a version of the game where my choices on what stats to highlight are constrained by the character's player -- beyond the simple 'don't be a dick' rule that applies to all gaming -- but our assumption at first was that this game was not designed that way, and eventually what happened is that frustration built up <i>to the point</i> that highlighting certain stats was perceived as 'being a dick' -- at which point we discussed it and stopped doing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274438/#Comment_274438" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-04T05:55:37+00:00" title="June  4, 2010  5:55AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2010 6:02AM by lumpley.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can answer this!<br/><br/>By plain oversight, I didn't include the rules for changing your highlighted stats in the playtest doc, or even in the preview book. They're in the final book, of course.<br/><br/>The rules are:<br/><br/>At the end of any session, anybody can say "hey, let's change highlighted stats." Do. Just go again through the same stat-highlighting process you started with -- for every PC, the high-Hx player chooses 1 and the MC chooses 1.<br/><br/>When you're highlighting stats, highlight one that you genuinely think will be interesting. If the character never rolls, or can't roll, a stat, it's obviously not going to be interesting to highlight it. As the player in question, you should always point out the stats you don't roll.<br/><br/>You're also allowed to say "but I want something other than cool highlighted!" or "hey would one or the other of you highlight my weird?" or "okay, but I like my highlights fine the way they are." It's their choice, but you're allowed to say what you want.<br/><br/>These are all totally fine and appropriate interactions, presuming that everybody's already following the above rules:<br/><br/>Keeler: Marie, I can't decide whether to highlight your sharp or your weird.<br/>Marie: My sharp please!<br/>Keeler: Sure.<br/><br/>Keeler: Marie, I can't decide whether to highlight your sharp or your weird!<br/>MC: Don't sweat it, whichever you choose, I'll highlight the other one.<br/><br/>Marie: Keeler! Please highlight my sharp!<br/>Keeler: Okay, but I don't know if I want to.<br/>MC: I'll get her sharp, Keeler. Highlight what you want.<br/><br/>Marie: Keeler highlighted my weird but I really want my sharp highlighted. MC, would you?<br/>MC: Sure, no prob, but next time we change highlights I'm choosing your hard, so be prepared for that.<br/><br/>Since highlights change all the time, getting it wrong isn't costly, and neither is accommodating someone else's wants for a session or two. <br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274440/#Comment_274440" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-04T06:06:08+00:00" title="June  4, 2010  6:06AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aha!

I'm not having any fun looking like a failure every game.<br/>MC: It's funny when you fail.  Learn to enjoy it.  Hard.<br/><br/>I mean, obviously it's a selfish move for any player to highlight a stat that the person just doesn't want to have to roll (and yes, I know, highlighting isn't a straight-jacket, you could just not roll Hard) but there's really nothing in the rules that says you shouldn't do that.<br/><br/>I mean, it's not hard-coded into the ruleset but there's a lot of talk of fuckery and making things hard on the characters and I feel like maybe, on a read through the rules, this attitude could bleed into the highlighting procedure, too.<br/><br/>There's an authorship-of-character issue here, I think, that was getting to me when I played.

There's huge emphasis in the text about only doing things that are interesting -- which typically means interesting for the players as well as the MC.  If you keep highlighting Hard, that's not interesting for the player and ultimately not going to lead to a good game.  It's against the rules!

I mean, obviously, in a realistic play setting, I am interested and I care that my character is fun for everyone else at the table but what if I'm just the kind of player who doesn't care if you think my being Hard is interesting?

When they decide where to go next and what to do, they'll be all, "I go over to Dremmer's shack, over here behind the chemical shed."<br/><br/>If the sheet of paper shows the whole coastline and the four settlements along it, plus the train tracks and the oil rig out at sea, then <i>that's</i> their world. When they decide where to go next and what to do, they'll be all, "I take the train to Salt River to talk to Cricket about those murders he needs done."<br/><br/>Think about the scale and the size of your Apocalypse World. And when to add another sheet of paper's worth to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274758/#Comment_274758" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-06T13:19:42+00:00" title="June  6, 2010  1:19PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The mapping was a part of AW that I really enjoyed.  We had maps that, even though we never used them in any traditionally "useful" way they gave us a pretty good idea of how the world fell together.  As we needed a place, we added it to the map.  Since it was a collaborative effort (rather than something like D&amp;D where the DM makes his map and the players make theirs and, in the end, you see that you all had a really different idea of where the bugbears lived) we all got to invest something in the map.  <br/><br/>I had a map of Iris' house (an empty garage) and it was almost like my characters' inventory.  We knew that Iris had a broken radio because we could point to the map and say "there it is, on the milk crate next to the decomposing futon".  <br/><br/>The maps really did scale out, too.  It started as "Here is Willis' hold - it's where Kim and Iris live.  Here's a few houses and the dog-kennel and that place where Iris and Balls got in a scuffle" and then slowly spread out, like a stain - we added in Chang's (that motherfucker) Farm and the place where Willis' son got killed.  By the end, we had a folio of maps that painted a really interesting picture of the world our game had been written into.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274759/#Comment_274759" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-06T13:21:37+00:00" title="June  6, 2010  1:21PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.
