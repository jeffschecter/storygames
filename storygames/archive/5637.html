It takes Neo's speech from the end of the movie as the New Gospel:\n<blockquote>I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid. You're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you, a world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries, a world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.</blockquote>\nI call it, <b>The Matrix: Revealed</b>.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/matrix_revealed.html" rel="nofollow">Here's the opening scene in screenplay format.</a> (It's short. Give it a look.)<br/><br/>So, you get the idea. The opening mirrors the original film, but with the roles reversed: the humans are the hunters and the programs are the prey. Morpheus is suped up, and apparently in charge. Where's Neo? What's the human agenda?<br/><br/>So that's where you come in, Story Gamers. Let's reboot the Matrix sequels for gamey goodness, taking that screenplay snippet as the starting point. <i>Everything</i> about the official sequels can be ignored or stolen as you like. What would be cool in this world? What are the canon characters all about this time around? Remember, we have not seen Zion and we don't know anything about the true nature of the machine world.<br/><br/>I was thinking that Morpheus is still the True Believer, but turning corrupt steward. He was persecuted, now he's the persecutor. Neo as the aloof, disconnected, zen dude might still work, but his speech up above pegs him as the Prometheus/revolutionary type, I think. Neo is tricky.<br/><br/>Anyway, have at it. If we get around to talking about how to do this at the table (systems even), that's even better.<br/><br/>(By the way, the third movie in my series is <b>The Matrix: Reborn</b>. Feel free to riff on that part of the rebooted sequel timeline, too.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126073/#Comment_126073" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T16:57:30+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  4:57PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whenever I click on the link, it comes out as source html.

It's turtles all the way down, my dear. But why does it work that way?<br/>** The machines are protecting humans from themselves, and so "unfold" a new level each time a human has an insight that would give them the lower level's ability (ex: Neo can EMP--and, thus, presumably fly eventually--in Lvl2, which means that they have to unfold a Level 3 in which he can't).<br/>** Possible coolness: the Lvl 3 is whatever that human thinks they deserve for "afterlife": heaven or hell, a closed loop "rebirth" back into Lv1 1 in a "new" personality (Hindu), a merging with the Core OS above Level 3 (Buddhism), whatever.<br/>*** Thus, the game involves bootstrapping abilities up another level (or down--cool idea, too!--there's "angels" or "effrits" in Lvl 2 or even 1) so that one can eventually "break out" to the next level up.<br/><br/>* At Lvl 1, death = death at Lvl 2 (per the movies). So, suppose at Lvl 2, "death" is an entryway to Lvl 3. Put another way, any "death" bubbles the "victim" up to Lvl 3 automatically.<br/>** After all, they never really explained how dieing at Lvl 1 would be any different from "dieing" in a dream: maybe the "illogic" is just a way to slow down Lvl 1 mastery, by booting the dieing person up to a Lvl 3 in which they'd be "satiated" by "life's reward" and would also expect immortality. Once a human think he or she is in heaven eternally, he or she isn't likely to start rattling the bars of the Lvl 3 cage to get to Lvl 4.<br/>** Basically, the machines are making human immortal, or near to it.<br/><br/>* Or, hey, the humans ARE effectively immortal... because they are Flatlines: complex AI and personality programs running in a colossal computer system.<br/>** Maybe the End Game/Coda is finding out that all of the minds are, in fact, embedded in a vast, black-hole-powered, multi-dimensional Archive at the End of the Universe, which "the machines" (actually, the ancient races of the Universe) setup to try to ride out the heat death of the Universe.<br/>** So, if someone can unfold to Level 4, he or she would be (basically) external to the operating core of the system. He or she (it, really) would be able to sense or act upon whatever management systems and controls are exposed in the black-hole archive OS.<br/><br/>Of course, that's a stagnant ending: maintenance with no change. But, in the end, is it turtles all the way down, or is there a final escape, and why would the "final level" be physical anyway? (It's kind of inefficient to maintain and store fully formed humans, when brains in jars or digitized personalities are so much less material- and maintenance-intensive.) Even better, if they've got Super Science that (for instance) uses the interstices of atomic bonds--or, hell, the flux of gravity waves--to encode such personalities. There could be, literally, BILLIONS and BILLIONS of "worlds" within this 4-level Hierarchy of Being--maybe breaking out to Lvl 4 lets the players begin to literally define elements of whole peoples and worlds, which are "isolated" from the other worlds at the Lvl-3-and-below levels.<br/><br/>Ah... rambling is fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sean2099" title="sean2099"><img alt="sean2099" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sean2099">sean2099</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126228/#Comment_126228" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-13T11:28:55+00:00" title="February 13, 2008 11:28AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Who says the AI programs in the Matrix are computer programs?

Nifty.</blockquote>I'd make it a mix. In a setting like that, there are three things I'd be really interested in:<br/><br/>-<b>Conflict between Free Minds</b>: There would have to be, at the very least, two factions, potentially more. One would follow in the wake of the "Church of Neo" of the first movie and would be really, really hardcore. Like, monodominant WH40k Inquisitors with added Bullet Time and the Certainty that the people they are killing aren't even really alive. Then we have one that sides with the more "humane" AIs and opposes the church and maybe there are a couple of others, like one that thinks the Matrix is fine as.<br/>-<b>The Witch Hunt, playing the hunted</b>: In this game, the role of the hunted AIs would make an interesting one. All your existence, you've been on the side of the Status Quo. You were The Man and The System. Suddenly, all that has changed and the roles are reversed. Now you are prey for the Church crazies and while that's not fun, it would make for a good game.<br/>-<b>The Breaking of the Matrix</b>: The third part I'd like to see in play is how fucked-up the Matrix has become. In the movie, it had it's ugly parts, but it was very much "now, as we know it". In this game, that too is over. The propaganda of the Church and the elimination of many central Matrix sub-routines has made the world a bad, bad place. Without AI supervision and strengthened by the cultists Doomsaying, the dark parts of humanity rise to the surface and this game should show it. It would be a mix of Blade Runner, Strange Days and the Crow movies. It would also be awesome. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>So I'd have a mix of Free Minds and AIs as PC, slugging their way through the horrors of the matrix, hunted by Churchies and, well, everybody, really.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128362/#Comment_128362" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T03:28:37+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  3:28AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rock.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131932/#Comment_131932" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-01T23:02:15+00:00" title="March  1, 2008 11:02PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was randomly thinking about this topic this morning. <br/><br/>One of the things that I've always wondered about the first film is Morpheus's certainty that Neo is the One. The very first thing established in the film is that Morpheus's crew is watching Neo, and that Morpheus believes he is the One. Why? When Neo first appears, we learn he's a hacker and that he's scanning news reports about Morpheus, but later Trinity explains that she went through a similar experience before joining Morpheus, so that's not enough to mark Neo out as special. So, why Neo? How does Morpheus come by his certainty?<br/><br/>What if Morpheus's role is greater than simply "finding" the One? What if Morpheus knows Neo is the One because he made him that way? Perhaps Morpheus is an even greater hacker than we realize from the first film; perhaps he's actually an AI inhabiting a human body. Is he a rebel, or is he the secret mastermind? I'm imagining something like the scene of Neo reaching the Architect at the Source, except in this version Neo finds himself in the endless white of "the construct", seeing the same two leather chairs from his first meeting with Morpheus - except the chairs face away from him - and hearing Morpheus saying "Hello, Neo" just as he does the first time they talk on the phone. I don't mean to say that it should follow the same plot as Reloaded, just that at some point there should be a similar surprising reveal, things are not as we (and Neo) thought, but this time Morpheus turns out to be behind it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131986/#Comment_131986" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-02T16:06:39+00:00" title="March  2, 2008  4:06PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2008 4:11PM by Simon_C.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once upon a time I planned a game which would have started as a High Fantasy romp, with heroic characters fighting the bad guys in a totally railroaded plot.  Of course, the players being who they were, they would have totally rebelled against the railroad.  And the in-game response would have been swift and brutal.  Increasingly difficult challenges would have faced them if they left the path.  Especially if they headed towards the "tower of good" in the center of the realm.  Agents of the King would begin to hunt them down, Agents who posess incredible power.  Of course, for the players, this is all gravy.  They'd head for that tower as quick as they could.  They'd fight their way up the tower, through the seemingly "good" guys.  And wake up.  <br/><br/>They're in a darkly distopian future, where political prisoners are kept in a VR prison.  They've woken up, and now they're being hunted.  Their only allies are the secretive "Hidden Order" who have a base somewhere, that the PCs must never visit, lest it be discovered.  I'd explain to the players that the last game was just a setup for this, the real game.  Now they can follow the "real" plot, of destroying the government of this dark future.  Of course, this plot is just as railroaded as the last, except this time I'm using OOC coersion to keep them on the right track.  Finally, over my protests, they find the secret base, and wake up!<br/><br/>They're in a technologically advanced utopia, where there is no hunger, and no desire.  Everything a human could need is provided for them by giant organic constructs which resemble plants and trees.  Everyone spends their time hooked up to "Dream Plants" which provide exciting adventures, and escape from the boredom.  There is nothing to do here.  Somehow, the PCs would create enough havoc in the world to finally wake up.<br/><br/>Turtles all the way down!<br/><br/>I was a dick back then.  But I still kinda like the idea of manipulating the tropes of RPGs as part of a "Matrix" type game.  After all, the irony of an RPG character searching for "reality" shouldn't be lost on anyone.  Isn't the natural conclusion of such a game for the player to end the game, and go out into the "real" world?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131988/#Comment_131988" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-02T16:37:45+00:00" title="March  2, 2008  4:37PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon C,<br/>that would be OK if not played as a "mind-fuck-GM-knowsitall" setting, but if you informed the players about what's going to happen.

You're challenging not just the character's perception of their reality, but also the players' perceptions of the game's reality.  Of course, as you say, this creates the "Mind Fuck" game, which isn't really that much fun, so I don't think it's a good idea that way either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132192/#Comment_132192" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-03T17:48:19+00:00" title="March  3, 2008  5:48PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if you presented your players not with the idea that "here's what's going to happen" but instead "I've got this idea for a colossal mindfuck adventure."  The trick then would to have enough layers of mindfuck to resist the player's trying to understand what's happening in terms of it being a mindfuck.

This thread is making me come back to SG from a long long vacation.<br/><br/>1 - I planned on making my own matrix rpg once; it was a weird mix of ideas, quite incoherent actually, but some of those are being repeated here. I might dig up the project.<br/>2 - In that time, i REALLY inspired myself with the material on the matrix website, and i urge you to do the same. Specially, the comics and Gaiman\xb4s short story; those really expand the setting\xb4s potential, IMO.<br/><a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/</a> - there.<br/>3 - I had the very same idea ( or sort of ), that Simon there had, but when i was thinking about Creative Agendas in a subway ride. Back then i was struggling to "get" Narrativism, and i thought it was a version of Illusionist genre-emulating sim. So the basic idea was to make the same as Simon: a railroady game with a lot of genre-emulating mechanics, but that enclosed the character so much that he struggles to break free... to a very realistic sim game in the "outer world". I was much more inspired by The Truman Show, though. I think that if the players know they are "playing Truman" it would go ok and not "me vs. the mind fucking GM"...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132203/#Comment_132203" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-03T19:36:27+00:00" title="March  3, 2008  7:36PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2008 8:07PM by DevP.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really loved the first film, on its own, because by itself if feels like a composed, subtle whole where nothing is entirely trustworthy. It's not about fact and minutae in a world, and it's not about individual characters, but it's certainly about character interactions; it's a "what-if" of nested narratives that you keep peeling off the back of your eyelids.<br/><br/>After watching the third film, there was moment that I realized the trilogy almost made sense, perhaps, if you were viewing the trilogy as a whole as a kind of muddled, recreolized whole that parents told their children: "Yes, son: this world was remade into a better one. And someday, if we try hard enough, like Neo, we can find our way beyond, to the real one." Again: it's a narrative throwing archetypes together, trying to reveal to you some other wisdom.<br/><br/>So, the most satisfying narrative for me might be, perhaps, sticking with either the post-first-movie world, or treating the whole trilogy as some ancient gospel, but ultimately focusing on an uncertain world and gnostic self-knowledge, wrapped in the forms of the movies we know. <br/><br/>EDIT: <a href="http://games.forgreatjustice.net/2008/03/03/the-matrix-unknowable/" rel="nofollow">i rave more</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/unlikelylass" title="unlikelylass"><img alt="unlikelylass" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/danaellijohnson/SH5C2Orf01I/AAAAAAAAAFk/gbu1XwxZFyE/s144/dana-tiny.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/unlikelylass">unlikelylass</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144361/#Comment_144361" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T23:48:48+00:00" title="May 15, 2008 11:48PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had the following thought after seeing the second movie:<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, no, no -- you should end the second movie by having someone, maybe even Neo, while in the "Zion/Real World" environment, <i>wake up</i> to yet a third layer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also read somewhere that the original idea was not have the power source thing, but that the machines were using human brains as computer processors -- which "explains" the powers and whatnot:  there's feedback between the human brains 'running' the software, and the virtual environment, which is one of those 'programs'.
