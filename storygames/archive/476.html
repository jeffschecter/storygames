                    So.  I've been considering, ever since Nir Shiffer linked to the Muy Macho thread in his livejournal and I came over here and read it, how to respond.  I am, at some level, offended.  The use of the term 'macho' to describe a style of game is meant to be humorous, I know; but it's also exclusionary, whether you meant it to be or not.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to be taken as a humorless feminist; that's every woman's fear when she gets into this sort of conversation.  I understand that the term 'macho' was more meant to evoke Saturday Night Live skits and maked wrestlers than it was to evoke a tradition of masculine oppression.  I'm asking you all to understand that, for me anyway, you can't have one without the other.<br/>
<br/>
You might think that because I'm generally an advocate of low-impact, cooperative gaming that I just don't understand, but I assure you that I do.  I've played characters in situations that were scary and dangerous and challenging to both character and player, and I'm proud of how I've responded.  So maybe I don't feel the need to puff up my chest about it; then again, in comparison, my chest is already filled out far more than the rest of yours, isn't it?<br/>
<br/>
In a forum with such a miniscule percentage of female participants, it's hard to maintain perspective, sometimes.  Hey, I've been a woman gamer for years, and I'm used to the boys' club thing.  I'm not asking you to stop putting your cocks on the table, grabbing your balls or asking me to grow a pair, but I am asking you maybe to consider how me, and women like me, might feel when by your writing you suggest that to game, or to design games, or to play this type of game, is to be male.<br/>
<br/>
Look, I kinda like this forum.  If I didn't, I wouldn't bother writing this because god knows I don't go looking for the huge heap of recrimination that I'm sure is soon to follow.  I'm a pretty quiet person, even on the internet, and it's sometimes hard to speak up, but I really do feel like it's something that needed to be said.                </div>

                            Hey Peaseblossom, <br/><br/>I'm glad you said something, because I really want this to be a friendly and welcoming place.  I want to have conversations with people who see things differently and not scare them away by being a Very Special Jackass.  <br/><br/>Were you offended by the name, the sentiment, or both?  For what it's worth I'm sure Tony will reassure you, in his best Lorenzo Lamas voice, that you don't need cojones to be Muy Macho, but that's certainly beside the point.  I think it's cool that you brought this up, so let's address it as best we can.                        </div>

                            Peaceblossom,<br/><br/>Okies I have a few questions for you... I want to make sure that I am not making a generalization here so please don't be upset if I misquote/misunderstand what you were/are trying to say.  But I just have to know what upset you in the first place with that thread.  <br/><br/><code> I don't want to be taken as a humorless feminist; that's every woman's fear when she gets into this sort of conversation. </code><br/><br/>I disagree that being considered a humorless feminist is every woman's fear.  As a woman, my greatest fear is childbirth.  That's it hands down.  It scares the snot out of me.  (But I digress).  I'd say that anyone's fear is being considered humorless.  Be they feminists, or not.  <br/><br/><code> I understand that the term 'macho' was more meant to evoke Saturday Night Live skits and maked wrestlers than it was to evoke a tradition of masculine oppression.</code><br/><br/>*blink*  Whaaaaa?  *tilts head to the side like a stumped/confused puppy*  Okay you lost me there.   Are you trying to say that gaming as a whole is oppressing women/feminine thinking?   <br/><br/><code>  I'm asking you all to understand that, for me anyway, you can't have one without the other. </code><br/><br/>Why can't you have one without the other?  When I think of the word macho, I think of the word strength and confidence.  Is this a bad thing?  <br/><br/><code> You might think that because I'm generally an advocate of low-impact, cooperative gaming that I just don't understand, but I assure you that I do. I've played characters in situations that were scary and dangerous and challenging to both character and player, and I'm proud of how I've responded. So maybe I don't feel the need to puff up my chest about it; then again, in comparison, my chest is already filled out far more than the rest of yours, isn't it? </code><br/><br/>But here's the thing... you are puffing out your chest with that statement.  And don't be upset about it.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Now this isn't meant as an attack.  I just want you to realize this.  (And never, ever underestimate the mystical power of your hooters.  Push them out there.  You'd be surprised at how much power and strength they convey.)  <br/><br/>See, I've read this thread and the one you refer to a few times and I have yet to find out what exactly it is that has you offended.  How is the word macho 'exclusionary'?  Doesn't that also mean that the word feminine is as well?  By your rationale that means we can't describe men or anything related to the masculine form/person/mind/etc with that term or use it near them for fear of offending them?<br/><br/>I'm glad you brought this thread up as well.  I'd like all the men on this board to realize that not all women feel the same.  (As I'm sure that not all men feel the same either.)  I've had the thought before that I wasn't being treated the same as a gamer. I've mulled it over many times before.  Then I remembered, I am being treated the way I let myself be treated.  Once I got over that, I've not had a problem since.  <br/><br/>Lisa P                        </div>

<br/>
What bothers me is the name; as far as I'm concerned, Tony can play however he likes within, you know, legal parameters; but, by naming the style 'Macho' it's implying that it's a style that only guys can participate in.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, I'm generally charitable about these things, so I assume that that's not really what was meant, but you can't use an exclusionary term like that and expect everyone to ignore the subtext.<br/>
<br/>
If I wrote up pretty much the exact same list of traits, and instead called that style the Girly Gamer, I imagine that a lot of the men who frequent this forum would have a hard time coming forward and acknowledging that they also enjoy playing that style of game.                        </div>

                            Lisa:  <br/>I am not saying gaming is oppressive to women, I am saying the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machismo" rel="nofollow">machismo</a> is, and applying it to gaming concepts, even as a joke, thus makes gaming moreso.<br/><br/>I also do not apprecate concepts like 'strength' and 'confidence' being associated primarily with men, nor do I appreciate any particular style of gaming being associated primarily with men.<br/><br/>I'm glad that you consider yourself liberated, that's great.

                            I want to tell a short story. I'm not sure how relevant it is, but bear with me.<br/><br/>A few months ago a couple of friends and I were setting up <a href="http://shiffer.livejournal.com/195360.html" rel="nofollow">Kickass Space Adventures</a>, a game which in setting and tone takes the <i>Muy Macho</i> approach and drives it to the wall - all the characters were super-cool and took everything the world had to throw at them because it only proved how much more macho they were when they won. Hell, they looked for trouble <i>just because it's what they do</i> (this wasn't a terribly serious game. You might have caught on to that).<br/><br/>Anyway, this was a few months ago, when we all had girlfriends, and one of them was totally psyched - she thought the game was totally awesome and she wanted in... but it was impossible. Even after the trouble with finding a suitable character (this was a blatant media-plagiarism game, Angelina Jolie was already cast as the Queen of England, and she didn't have any other ideas for suitable characters because there aren't that many that fit the bill), it was like the game itself rejected her. It screamed "this is a game for men. MANLY MEN". <br/><br/>(We didn't end up excluding her, but that's not the point.)<br/><br/>I'm not sure what the connection is, if there are any, between what Jess is saying and this story, but I just wanted to pipe in and say:<br/><br/>She is not imagining it. These phenomena exist.<br/><br/>I'm sure Tony only meant the best, and I found said thread and spinoffs both hilarious and completely non-offensive. And what's more, even after reading Jess' post and saying "okay", I still wouldn't know how to "be more sensitive", or whatever. But... something. I don't know what.                        </div>

                            Hmm. As I understand it,  if Edith Piaff was a character in a narrativist rpg, then her player would most assuredly be Muy Macho. So I disagree the mapping is as you say, Nir.                        </div>

                            You know, the more I think about it, the _Muy Macho_ creed seems to be skew to it's name.  <br/>
<br/>
I mean, the whole idea is "hurt me, cause taking the pain makes me cool" isn't necessarily Macho - Macho is "Good God, I thank you for my **Gigantic member!**  Now, to demonstrate the size of my swinging third leg, I will shoot many people with my well oiled heavy machine gun and orbital howitzers for no other reason than the glory of my manhood!"  And I can see how one might object  to that sentiment.<br/>
<br/>
But isn't "hurt me, I'm cool" more like the Punk Rock credo?  And as much as there's a little misogyny associated with Punk Rock (Nancy's man done her wrong...) it's not inbuilt into the creed.<br/>
<br/>
Beside, I'd rather be __**Punk Rawk!**__ than muy macho anyday.                        </div>

<i>Hmm. As I understand it, if Edith Piaff was a character in a narrativist rpg, then her player would most assuredly be Muy Macho. So I disagree the mapping is as you say, Nir.</i><br/><br/><br/>I don't know who that is, and Google isn't helping much (not knowing who it is makes it hard to dig when the straight search comes up blank). But still, the existence of a single character (or several) who answers the criteria doesn't disprove anything, because it's not about "women can't kick ass in space". It's about something else. If I knew exatly what that something else was I like to think that I would be adored by millions right now. Alas, that is not the case.<br/><br/>And the mapping may be wrong. I'm not really sure how the mapping works.                        </div>

                            I just had a thought.  Is it because the word Macho -is- a masculine word?  I just remembered that.  (I'm taking Spanish for the Workplace here at work).  See, in some other languages, words actually have a sex.  I know that French and Spanish have sexed their words.  Of course in English, we have absorbed a lot of words from other languages and use them all the time without 'sexing' them per se.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe that is part of the root of the problem?  <br/>
<br/>
Like for example, people hear the word feminine and instantly think of softness, kindness, and loving.  It's because it's a 'female' word in other languages.  <br/>

I know where you're coming from. I think it's difficult to do anything about it, though.<br/>
<br/>
I get frustrated in a similar way: I'm British, but many indie RPGs are written with the assumption that the players are American. It's <i>hugely</i> annoying, for me, to read "This game is set in a typical American high school" or similar. That said, I don't think there's anything that can be done about it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway. Thought the analogy might help. Enough of me. Back to you.<br/>

                            Lisa, <br>
Machismo is a specific ideology.  To quote the wikipedia link I posted above:<br>
<br>
"As an attitude, machismo ranges from a personal sense of virility to a more extreme masculism. Most machistas believe in conservative gender role ideas. Generally speaking, machistas oppose a woman's right to work, participate in sports, or pursue other traditionally male roles in society. Many machistas also believe it is their right as men to seek extramarital adventures, although women are to remain faithful. Machistas believe that women were created to stay home and be mothers and wives. Thus, most machistas believe firmly in the superiority of men over women."<br>
<br>
To be 'macho' is to follow that ideology.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>

I really appreciate you sharing your experiences here. <br>
<br>
I think the only thing you can do about it is to call people on their biases.  A lot of times it's a pretty benign mistake and simply pointing it out will help change things because in the future said people will know to be more conscious of said biases.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally, said people don't care or actively promote said biases, in which case you have to resort to stronger measures.                        </br></br></br></div>

<i>Crossposted with the last </i>four<i> messages</i><br/><br/>Thanks for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machismo" rel="nofollow">the link</a>, Jess. To me, "macho" was just an "I am tough" attitude that men <i>and women</i> could have — though mostly men acted that way — and it was worthy of parody . The term had been scrubbed of its earlier, more serious meaning by decades of (better) use. I had no idea that it represented anything as disgusting as domestic violence. <br/><br/>I am pretty sure Tony meant no ill will by using the term. It's like when I discovered the original "<a href="http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Eeny%2C_meeny%2C_miny%2C_moe" rel="nofollow">Eenie, meenie, miney, mo, catch a tiger by the toe</a>" wasn't really about a tiger. I'd been using the phrase since I was a kid and, like the <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0302/27/ltm.16.html" rel="nofollow">Southwest Airlines flight attendant</a>, had never heard the original, racist version.<br/><br/>I wonder though if the word "macho," like the eenie-meenie rhyme, has been scrubbed clean of its original Spanish-culture meaning in 21st Century English. <br/><br/>What do you, Jess, hope Tony and the other <i>¡Muy Macho!</i> gamers will do in response to your post?                        </div>

                            Jess,<br/><br/>I disagree.  I don't  think you -have- to follow that ideology to be macho.  Just like those that are -girly- have to worship all things Hello Kitty.  I think in all honesty that -that- is a bad generalization.  <br/><br/>See, you missed something though in that wikipedia.  It also says: <br/><br/>"Machismo is a noun of Spanish origin, and refers to a prominently exhibited or excessive masculinity. The word machismoÃ¢â‚¬â€and its derivatives machista and macho, "he who espouses machismo"Ã¢â‚¬â€comes from the Spanish word macho, meaning "male" or "manly". (The word macho literally translates as "male", but is applied primarily to animals in this sense.) In Spanish macho can sometimes mean "courageous" or "valorous", although machista rarely has such positive connotations."<br/><br/>What you're quoting is the machista (which is below the section I just posted).  <br/><br/>I'm not saying it doesn't happen.  What I'm saying is, there are different meanings for words and I believe you misunderstood what Tony LB was trying to say.  <br/><br/>If anything, I thought he was more explaining a masochist than anything macho.  (But that's my opinion.)<br/><br/>But I do digress.  Yes as Adam said, what do you hope Tony and the Muy Macho gamers will do/say?<br/><br/>Lisa P                        </div>

Consequently, it fits female characters as well as male characters. In a sense, this may be what is motivating peaseblossom, in that she might (hypothetically speaking) want to play a Piaf, but has an issue that that style of play would be considered Macho, hence, masculine.<br/><br/>That said, why can't we have 2 terms, Muy Macho and something else snappy?

                            Words are such funny things. <br/><br/>Jess is not wrong when she points to the Wiki article and says that "macho" has some very negative connotations. She's also not wrong that using such a word in the context of a culture that has some very gender-biased history is problematic. <br/><br/>However, others are not wrong when they say that "macho" is not always used in the sense that the article suggests. (In fact the article is tagged as being problematic.) I do know women who describe themselves as being macho, and many males who describe themselves as "macho" without meaning anything that would ever approve of domestic abuse*.<br/><br/>Most of all, JD is right when he talks about a big iceburg whose tiny tip is what we're seeing now. Really, this is a little movement in a big war of semnatic realignment, and is talking much less about the specific word being used and much more about the way those silly words form identity and meaning in cultural situations. <br/><br/>Taking it away from the Wiki completly, all we have to do to see an issue is stay with the much less controversial OED, which tells us that "macho" means "A man; spec. a notably or ostentatiously masculine, tough, or vigorous man; one who is aggressively proud of his masculinity." Any cultural ugliness aside, that does say "Are you a MAN when you play?" <br/><br/>Which brings us right into the heart of the English language and its gender non-neutrality -- such a fun subject, that I've seen one PhD in English punch another PhD in English right in the face over it -- as well as  and RPing history and its gender non-neutrality -- such a fun subject I've seen almost every RPG forum go up in flames over it at least once. And one, as Lisa has shown us, that is going to have members of both genders on every possible side. <br/><br/>So, besides the fact that it's complicated, where do I stand on this? Like this: <br/><br/>Jess, if you want me to not say "Macho" because it makes you feel excluded, I won't say it. I do not agree with your assesment of the cultural value of the word, but I do respect your position as a voice in this community, and because of that respect I will change my terminology until we can come to a synthesis about the word's use. <br/><br/>Acceptable? <br/><br/><br/>*I also found the implicit cultural imperalism in the Wikipedia article to be a little unsettling, but lets not explode that one here.                        </div>

                            One thing I'd like to have people keep in mind is that "macho" and "machismo", and the negative cultural implications associated, are not historical or outmoded concepts.  They still exist in various communities and cultures as we speak.  Women suffer because of it today.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, many people use it in a gender neutral or gender inclusive  fashion, but many people call things "gay" in a perjorative way even when they aren't at all referring to homosexuals.  Yet the usage is still problematic. <br/>
<br/>
I think it's pretty clear that the original poster meant the concept humorously.  But I also think it's useful, and important, to sometimes take a step back and consider what words can mean, not just the narrow meaning one might intend at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don't think we've quite moved into a linguistic/cultural space yet where "macho" can be divorced from its male qualities, with the identification with maleness (of course there's nothing inherently wrong with maleness).  And that's a shame, because as it is, the "Muy Macho" concept brings up a dichotomy of hard vs soft, valorous vs retreating, perservering vs quitting, brave vs. cowardly, victorius vs defeated, tough vs wimpy, etc, and marries it to a pretty male gendered term.<br/>
<br/>
I mean "Macho" vs "Not macho" could easily be "Manly" vs "Womanly" or "Straight" vs "Faggy" or what have you.  I'm not really comfortable/happy with "Not Manly" having an inherent connotation of inferiority.                        </div>

                            Sorry for long absence from this forum.  As another woman, I would tend to agree with peaseblossom in that I could not describe myself as Muy Macho because of the masculine connotations.  I am most definitely female and while I have played extremely masculine characters, tough as nails, they are not even Macho.  The only time I played a male character, everyone got confused because it was me playing it and I am not male.  I am most definitely female: a strong-willed, tough-as-nails female.  So because of my femaleness, nothing I do can *possibly* be described as Muy Macho, or even Macho.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, I just scanned the original Muy Macho thread here and would like to note that everyone who posted was male.<br/>

                            I am going to double up on what telepresence said, this is not just linguistic, this is not just cultural, this is flesh and blood real, and that's one reason I am not even going to duck my head under the water to look at the iceberg.<br/>
<br/>
I live in the Southwest, and I work in child abuse and neglect. When you say "macho", I immediately think "savagely, regularly beats children". If you think the cultural angst over masculine vs. feminine traits in general society is hard to handle, come down here and see how marginalized Latino families are trying to cope with it. It's not just "a controversy" to me, it's a full-scale horror show and the further the curtain gets pulled back, the more shame, pain, blood and intergenerational destruction is revealed.<br/>

                            Hey, lots to respond to, here.  First, I agree with telepresence and JDCorley in that I wasn't speaking to a historical term in a far-off land; this is an attitude that effects men and women here and now.  And yes, this is just one thing out of many that I could probably take offense at if I felt like it; I don't have time to fight every battle, but Tony did specifically ask for feedback in his post (to respond a bit to Judd).<br>
<br>
As to what I want to happen in response to this post?  I think I covered that in my above, when I asked people to just consider a little more carefully about who they're including and excluding with their terminology.  Especially since there are a lot of game designers hanging around this forum, I think everyone would benefit from writing more inclusively.                        </br></br></div>

                            JBR, I do think that 'yanger' carries with it the idea that a type of gaming can have 'masculine' and 'feminine' qualities, and, while the term in itself isn't as offensive to me, I do think the idea is flawed.  I think effete is definitely a loaded term, because it associates femininity with weakness and excess, and because it's often used pejoratively to describe men, often homosexuals, so associating it with a gaming style is, to me, problematic.<br/>

What about guys who gladly self-identify as effete?  Why can a woman not be macho but a man can be effete?

                            You're right, I can't escape gendered language, but I can try and avoid the really loaded terms.  Macho pushes my buttons, yanger and effete, not so much, but I could understand why they might push someone else's buttons.<br/>
<br/>
As for the effete/macho thing, it's interesting, because usually it's the other way 'round.  Male names can become female (see: Leslie), but once they do, parents avoid naming boys with those names, and female names rarely become male.  Women can wear pants, but men can't wear skirts (this is changing in some circles, but it's not that prevalent, and kilts are a very specific exceptional case).                        </div>

                            Joshua, I agree wih you that it's going to be impossible to word everything in a perfect, neutral, inclusive, offensive-to-no-one manner.  We and the language we use are products of our own history and culture, and there will always be some baggage and biases there. <br/>
<br/>
But I reckon there are some clunkier things that we can train ourselves to avoid.  Move our habits of expression in better directions.  I was doing a journalism internship, years ago, and we were involved in a long, ongoing, interesting discussion of how language can alter meaning.  How using conventions of communication just because we're accustomed to it can become a trap, when we're interested in moving to something closer to "truth" or "clarity".<br/>
<br/>
The original poster had something to say about challenge in gaming, about accepting risk, accepting pain, about confidence, even overconfidence as a tool, or as a way of thinking about the player/gm or player/scenario relationship.  I don't have any inherent objection to any of that (I wouldn't necessary want to play that way myself, but it's obviously a valid path to take).  Add the "macho" aspect, and suddenly a lot of suff is added that I'm not sure helps me engage with the philosophy.  In fact, it has more of an effect of distancing me from the merits of the philosophy. This effect may be more pronounced for a female reader, or any reader who has had to deal with "real world macho" as opposed to "cartoony/jokey macho", even if the latter is pretty clearly what the original poster had in mind.  <br/>
<br/>
And that's unfortunate.  I'm not saying take all poetic license out of language, or humor, or even gender.  Just that contemplating the value of these choices, and recognizing there are options, is a good thing.                        </div>

                            JD,<br/><br/>I used to work with gangs in South Central LA, and I still have a different take on macho. Which is why I said the word is a funny thing. Not ha-ha funny, but "a tricky and inexplicable beast" funny. The word I say and the word you hear are not the same word, despite the fact we say them the same way. <br/><br/>Though, for the record on the RPGing front rather than the other front, I think that the terminology is important (thus my offer to Jess to stop using Macho, as its too loaded a term for her comfort) -- but I think that just as important are a lot of the rhetorical, rather than lexical, manners in which online RPG forums tend to be boys clubs. For example, I've often said that one of my issues (problems) with discourse in the Blogsphere and on the Forge is that its too focused on rocking with your cock out -- something others have used as praise, but that I used with an eye roll and a wince. <br/><br/>If the word is offensive to some is important. But, for the purpouses of this community ONLY, even more important can be the kind of discourse and stance towards each other, inclusion, and communication that we engage in with each other.                        </div>

                            To take Telepresence (and several other people) one step further, I think it's impossible to do all of this contemplation in advance, every time we write something.

<p>Wow.  I go away for a day, and look what grows up.  A charged, cordial conversation about my words which, frankly, I don't have a lot to contribute to.  I'll fall back on Marge Piercy, an excerpt from "Why Marry at all?":</p>

<p>I want the word, and the concept, <em>back</em>.  I'm taking them.</p>
<p>I totally understand and respect how people can be offended by the word.  I am offended by how it is commonly used.  I want to make room for it to be used more constructively.  Now I'm only an RPG designer, and this is only a tiny corner of the internet, but I'd dearly love to see the day when someone says with deep sadness "Bullying your wife?

<p>So yeah, JBR, I considered my words pretty carefully.</p>

                            As a woman and a feminist, I have less concern about the word Macho, but I'm willing to accept that it's differently loaded in my cultural context than it is in Jess's. In my experience "Macho" has less to do with oppressive action than it has to do with bravado: "macho" is posturing, self-aggrandizing, dick-|as a hoped symbol of power|--waving, aggressive, obnoxious behavior (note: you may not accept this take on the word, and you don't have to, but it's the loaded context I bring when reading this discussion). <br/><br/>So, when Tony posted the <i>iMuy Macho!</i> Manifesto, I couldn't help but think there was a certain amount of Tony's tongue firmly planted in his cheek, and so could view it humorously. If my context of "macho" actually contained any power at all - if my history of the word had been used to described men who beat their women to keep them in line, for example - I could see how it would be offensive to have men who you like and respect and with whom you enjoy a hobby and a community suddenly start wearing it like a badge of honor. Words are loaded, and words bordering on discussions of gender, race, sexuality, and ethnicity are more loaded than most guns - especially where they are closely followed by words like "manifesto".<br/><br/>So in the end, I don't find the word offensive. I do, however, have some frustration with the thread. Funny enough, I have more frustration with the Muy Macho thread as a result of this thread than I did of that thread aloneÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ which I just found kind of funny when I read it yesterday. What's the friction? I don't think I'll put it here, I think I'll start my own thread. You'll know it when you see it.                        </div>

                            Er... um... so I was going to avoid this thread, because 45 posts about gender issues in indie gaming (even on a forum as enlightened and civil as this one) sounds like a mess, but I got sucked into skimming it and now I feel like I have to respond.  Especially being the girly dirty hippie commie pinko player that I am.  Apparently I'm queer now too, thanks to John Kim (I hope it was good for you too, John).<br/><br/>Anyway, I thought most of the iMuy Macho! stuff was people poking fun at the balls-to-the-wall over-the-top emotionally-intense play style championed (at least, in my experience) by folks like Ron Edwards, Luke Crane, and Vincent Baker, which has become kind of the bread-and-butter of Forge-style indie roleplaying.  Obviously, a lot of good play and neat games (Dust Devils, Dogs, MLwM, etc.) came out of the desire for this kind of play, but it can seem really ridiculous to outsiders or if it's taken to extremes. Personally, I already find that style of play rather off-putting, sometimes even more off-putting than a lot of mainstream roleplaying, so having it characterized as "macho," a term I find to be totally ridiculous (as opposed to offensive or threatening) seemed fairly appropriate.<br/><br/>I don't think folks were planning to enshrine iMuy Macho! as a new jargon term to start throwing around all over the place.  We've been making jokes about "Macho Nar Yangers" for months now on Indie-Netgaming (and that probably started on the Forge first).  I figure, in a few weeks, we'll have moved onto other equally pointless and/or fruitful discussions.  I certainly hope Story Games will avoid developing a lot of silly jargon and also avoid the danger of taking itself too seriously.  I dread the day that I'll have to become a Story Games apologist as well as a Forge apologist.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and <i>girly dirty hippie commie pinko games forever!</i> </div>

                            Johnathan, <br/><br/>So far as I recall, you're the first guy that said Macho Nar Yanger -- as part of the discussion around Push/Pull IIRC. But hell, it could have been around before that. I know for sure you introduced me to the term though. I also recall having a <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/marginalia.php?entry=150&amp;comment=3553" rel="nofollow">conversation with Jim on Anyway</a> in which we came to the conclusion that said mode of gaming was functional and cool -- just not for Jim. <br/><br/>As far as my responses in that Other Thread go: I was both completly joking and completly serious at the same time. I was mocking and celebrating at once, and I can see how that would cause some disjointing and concern for any number of folks reading it. Especially those that don't know me, and don't know how I can be doing both almost ALL THE TIME.                        </div>

<p>I say what Brand said:  I am completely serious about the credo.  I think the concept is important.  I also think it's totally fuckin' hilarious.  This thing that I'm very serious about is something that makes me laugh until my ribs creak and I gasp for air.  I strongly recommend that you laugh about it too, because man there's a lot of funny there.</p>

                            Wait, Tony, now I need you to clarify something for me.  Do you or don't you think that this is a style of gaming for men only, or predominately for men?  Because your response leads me to believe that you think it is, else why insist on the use of the word macho?<br/>
<br/>
I'd also like to point out that it's something that it's perhaps easier for a certain group of people, say young white middle class men, to laugh about.                        </div>

<p>No, I don't think it's for men only.  Indeed, some of the most macho players I have encountered are women.</p>

                            Yeah...that's almost precisely why I don't find it a bit funny. But I won't stand in your way (or help you out), in either the thread here or on rpg.net, so rave on, man. I'm sure if I told you the jokes my wife thinks are funny you wouldn't even chuckle. Her sense of humor is terrible.  It's a big old world out there.                        </div>

<br/>
This thread has moved on a lot, but one question remains unanswered by you:<br/>
<br/>
What do you hope Tony and the Muy Macho gamers will do/say?<br/>
<br/>
You haven't answered that yet.  What is it you -really- want?  Do you want the board members, myself included, to not use sexually slanted words?  Do you want us to personally censor everything we write from now on?  <br/>
<br/>
See, I want to be sure to be able to help you feel comfortable here and free to express yourself (as I hope that all the other board members feel they can).  But now I have a feeling that some of them feel they can't anymore.  And I want to be part of the machine that changes that and helps them feel strong again and free to post what they want, when they want, again.  <br/>
<br/>
I personally think Tony's credo was great.  I laughed my ass off when I read it.  The only reason I didn't post to the thread is because I felt that there was no point in me just posting a 'me too!' post.  I had nothing truly useful to say so I didn't post.  I wonder if that's why the other women that read it didn't post...  Heck not every man on this board posted to it.<br/>

                            Lisa, I'm not Jess, but personally, I just want people to think a bit more about the implications of the words they use.  <br/>
<br/>
This hobby historically has asked itself (among other things) "How can we be more diverse/get more women/minorites interested/why aren't they more interested/etc".<br/>
<br/>
It's apparent in some of the responses that some people aren't necessarily very well versed in some of the implications of macho/machismo.  And that's kind of okay, since no one can know everything.  But after once learns what some of the problematic implications are, do people stir themselves to care?  That's the level where I'm most interested.<br/>
<br/>
"Well, it's harmless because it's funny"/"Well, I meant it one way so the other meanings are irrelevant."/"Well I want it to have a different meaning, so ignore the  ones that don't match my personal feelings."/"Well we don't want censorship."; none of those are reactions that hearten me.  They feel dismissive of the concern, rather than engaging it on its merits.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind, I have no problem with the concept underlying the sentiment and labeling.  It's not my personal gaming style, but a lot of things aren't my personal gaming style, that's no biggie.  I just think it would be great if we thought about the advantages of divorcing gender (or sexual orientation or race) from meaningful playstyle or character or moral differences.  Audacious is fine.  Brave is fine. Tough is fine.  But they aren't male.  "Macho" is, at least in at this point in human history, inescapably male.  So that conflation is unfortunate, even when meant humorously. (As I indicated earlier, I do't think many folks would be too keen on playing games "Manly" vs "Faggy").<br/>
<br/>
*shrug*  Words mean things, and different people bring a lot of perspectives to the table that it would be great to factor into the way we communicate with each other.                        </div>

Actually, I feel like I've answered that twice; once in the original post and once later on.<br/>
<br/>
If the people on this forum want to attract gamers of all shapes, sizes, colors and opinions, then they need to consider their language maybe a bit more carefully; what they write says a lot about their assumptions about what it means to a.) be a gamer and b.) read this forum.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not planning on getting on a little hat and playing progressive police patrol here.  It's not my forum, and it's not up to me.  It's up to everyone to decide how he or she wants to behave; I simply enjoy reading a lot of what goes on in this forum and would love to feel like I'm more at home here.                        </div>

Why oh why do so many women beat down on things that are 'manly' or 'masculine' yet cry/complain when they feel they 'are not allowed' to espress their 'femininity'?  Seems mighty unfair to me. <br/><br/>See, Tony said himself that he wants to reclaim macho.  Make it a proud word.  Kind of like bitch.  Or queer.  Those were/are words that have been/are being reclaimed and yelled proudly all over the world.  The only reason I didn't purchase the last t-shirt that said "Bitch" on it I saw was because they didn't have one in my size.  *laugh* <br/><br/><code>I just think it would be great if we thought about the advantages of divorcing gender (or sexual orientation or race) from meaningful playstyle or character or moral differences.</code><br/><br/>It -is- great.  So why won't you/can't you do it too?<br/><br/>I'm sorry if I seem a little overzealous about this but I'm tired of all the Politically Correct way of speaking and having to censor myself for fear that someone can't figure out the big picture in what I say yet focuses on the one tiny word I use.<br/><br/>This is going to sound so damn geeky it's almost shameful, (*laugh*) but I learned a valuable lesson from Star Trek when I was little.  Lt. Uhura is called "the Gentle Nigress" by Abraham Lincoln.  Everyone begins to chide him and correct him when she says "It's just a word.  I learned long ago not to be afraid of words."  <br/><br/>I've really taken that to heart and my life has been a lot easier for it.<br/><br/>Lisa P                        </div>

First of all, this is not the place where Macho can be reclaimed, nor is this the right context. The whole cocnept of reclaiming a word is fraught with difficulty, historical baggage and is one I'd rather seen steered away from in a community that is suppsoed to be inclusive. Macho is a word laden with meaning that is insulting, and it represents a style of discourse that doesn't belong here.<br/><br/>Second, it's not too much to ask people to be aware of that and consider what they say with a little sensitivity.<br/><br/>Third, this thread has steered a little too close to "blame the victim" for my comfort level.<br/><br/>Being sensitive and creating an environment where a large variety of people can deal wih issues that are aleady fraught with bagage (play style, and narrative and social contract) should be the purpose of this forum (and others like it). When the language used triggers other issues (racism, sexism, homophobia) this forum automatically fails in its mission.                        </div>

                            Lisa, I'm not quite sure I understand what you're asking.  There's nothing wrong, in my opinion, with maleness.  I simply don't want bravery, audacity, toughness, and such things, assumptively linked to maleness per se, let alone "macho" which encompasses negative concepts beyond plain old maleness.  They shouldn't be gendered concepts to me.<br/>
<br/>
(Also, for clarity's sake, I am myself a man.)<br/>
<br/>
As far as political correctness goes, the language is rich and deep.  It offers us tremendous opportunities for expression.  "Word choice" is not, in my opinion, censorship, nor is sensitivity to the different perspectives and backgrounds of a diverse audience "political correctness."  <br/>
<br/>
If you are explaining a concept and feel using the word "nigger" helps you express it, I will ask you to not use that word.  I don't think the burden in our communication is on me to not be offended, if I am reasonable and civil in explaining to you that I find it offensive.  Unfortunately, I find that too often, when people are asked, even in the most reasonable way, to respect the sensibilities of others, under circumstances where doing so would require little or no effort on their part, "political correctness" is trotted out as a defense against any moderation of language or behavior, or even acknowledgement that the perceptions of the other party have any legitimacy, ie., the "well, if you just had a thicker skin/better sense of humor it wouldn't be offensive" notion.  It's disappointing when it happens.                        </div>

I'm not trying to say that bravery, audacity, etc, etc are linked solely with all things maleness.  What I'm saying is that right now, yes, the word has a negative conotation to it.  But can no one also see that it -does- have a positive one as well?<br/>
<br/>
What I am saying is, I understand that people get offended.  But can't those same people see that sometimes, they have to let something like that pass over them like water over a duck?  There are so many more things in this world to be offended by.  Why pick certain words?  I do not happen to find the word nigger offensive (and yes, for the record, I'm mulatto) but you know what upsets me?  What upsets me is all the people around who cringe when they hear it and wait for someone to get offended.  What bothers me is the people that use the word but get offended when someone else they feel is 'not in their group' uses it or identifies with it.  <br/>
<br/>
Am I making any sense here?  I'm sorry, but I've never been very good expressing myself online.  I'm more of a face to face person.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't want anyone to think I am attacking peaceblossom here cuz I'm not!   I just want them to see the other side.  <br/>

<p>I'm sort of curious what the stakes are for this discussion.</p>
<p>It started off as venting mixed with curiosity ("How do the people involved feel about this whole 'Macho' thing?" and similar questions).  But this newest bunch of posts have a bit of a different feel.  It feels, increasingly strongly, that people are staking out ground on what is right or wrong ... what <em>belongs</em> here on Story Games.  Is that what people are trying to discuss?</p>

<p>I think that it's a good rule of thumb that if some group of people seems largely irked by some phrasing, it's a good sign that something is wrong, even if you don't see it immediately, and it's a good idea to at least dodge that phrase (even if you don't quite understand it yet) to err on the sake of moving on with the discussion.</p>
<p>This is definitely happening with Muy Macho, because despite that post being a good example of (1) a clear social contract and (2) a passionate credo about what they like from their roleplaying, the language is totally blocking us from talking about what we'd rather. (And not just here, but on that RPG.net thread as well: I feel that those responses to the credo were mostly about people (including women, I think?) talking about Huge Badass Warriors who killed everything - not the point of the original credo.)</p>
<p>So, I'm going to start a thread called "Gendered language to hack on", because I'd be interested in that - point out some language that's irked me a little bit, and I also look at alternate phrasings for the Muy credo. I'd feel better doing that.</p>
<p>To be clear, I don't think that's all to this discussion. though.</p>

                            Word to what Mo said.  She reinforces some feelings I've been having recently, but didn't really know how to articulate.  This is something bigger than just the iMuy Macho! stuff.<br/>
<br/>
The way people converse on Story Games is somewhat different from the way people converse on the Forge, but not all that different.  And we already know that the way people communicate on the Forge was off-putting enough to people like Mo and Jess to the point that they didn't feel comfortable posting there (judging from what they've posted in their personal blogs) and didn't feel like a part of that community.  My personal tastes and online practices have changed to the point where I don't feel like or becessarily want to be an active member of the Forge anymore, and I worry that Story Games may already be beginning to exhibit the same tendencies that made me increasingly dissatisfied with conversations on the Forge.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know whether it's inevitable that a forum frequented mostly by roleplaying dorks like ourselves will necessarily become a cockfest of slapping each other on our metaphorical asses, but there's definitely that danger.  Then again, maybe that's what Story Games, overall, wants to be.  I mean, I think there definitely should be a place for people to have conversations about roleplaying that don't have that tendency (and, for a while I think, 20x20 was such a place), but there's a good possibility that Story Games just isn't that place.  Andy's right that Story Games is basically just a year-round version of the Forge Birthday Forum, which means it's mostly like the Forge, but it has more room for joking and messing around.<br/>
<br/>
However, despite what people say, humor and joking are one of the least universal things on the planet.  People let down their guard for humor and that can explose some ugly things underneath (which may or may not be how they really feel and think).  And a bunch of dorky gamer guys joking around (I'm including myself in all these charaterizations) is not always gonna be pretty or accessible or inclusive or especially enlightened and fair.  But I don't think "more serious" is the solution.  The Forge is "more serious" than Story Games and it can be even less accessible.<br/>
<br/>
The only real suggestion I have is this: write for the audience you want to have.  If you are expecting that only fellow dorky gamer guys are going to be reading what you write, your writing voice will show that and other kinds of people (who would give you a more diverse audience with other valuable opinions) will be turned off or not feel like they can really have conversations with you.  And that's less cool, in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, yeah.  Sorry if this contributes to more topic drift.                        </div>

I didn't respond to that thread because I didn't feel I had much of anything useful to say.  All I could think of was "me too!" but that's not really useful so I didn't post.  But apparently I should have.   Call it my throw back from the Forge.  "Don't post if you don't have anything useful to say."<br/>

I think the grounding of this thread is awesome. Peaceblossom is all like, "Hey, I've got this beef. And since we're kind of a community and not just a discussion site, I kinda wanted to air this a bit".  Basically she wanted to get people thinking about the words they use.<br/><br/>Totally cool there. And I think further posts have indicated that people have thought about the words they use, and how they affect others. Awesome.<br/><br/>Now, as for "<b>Let's figure it out</b>", I'm totally not going to let this thread get there. There isn't going to be an <i>answer</i>. We're not going to <i>figure it out</i> by talking about it more, either through logic or casual discussion.  I think it's just gonna take time to see what emerges.<br/><br/>So let's wait and see what happens. Pretty much everyone's said their peace, and it's time to let all that stuff sink in. <br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-Andy                        </div>

When someone says the word "macho" to her, the first reaction is her laughter and derision. Frankly she can't believe people talk like that. So I think that maybe the meaning and stakes we give words don't last very long in the scheme of things. While I think this argument may have had a lot more cultural significance in the seventies or eighties. Now it means exactly bupkiss to the younger generation.                        </div>

                            Five years too late on this one...<br/>
<br/>
Let me put my ‘cock’ on the table — I am a female gamer and sometime GM, and I can be a fairly ‘humourless feminist’ at need. I am also a linguist by interest and profession — I have no wish to claim that my opinion is ‘infallible’ or in any way unchallengeable, merely that the usage of words is a topic of especial concern to me.  Remember that language is not always ‘rational’ — the connotations (auxiliary meanings, including the feelings aroused by words) are just as important, if not more so, than the denotation (the dictionary meaning).<br/>
<br/>
The thread reminds me of an argument I often have with men about the use of ‘he’ not only as a masculine pronoun of the third person but also as a gender-neutral pronoun of the third person. I won’t go into specifics, but the upshot is that few men actually see a problem with ‘he’ as gender neutral, and don’t see that we are excluded by it because the pronoun refers primarily to <b>them</b>, allowing them to see themselves as the ‘default’ gender.<br/>
<br/>
Now on to ‘macho’ and why peaseblossom, telepresence, JD Corley, Mo and I regard it as offensive in any context, but especially in what should be a pastime enjoyed by everyone.<br/>
<br/>
As Brand Robins has indicated, the OED defines ‘machismo’ as “the quality of being (anatomically) male” and ‘macho’ as “one that possesses that quality.” This is the ‘denotation’ of the word. However the connotations include arrogant self-promotion, violence, misogyny, homophobia, a willingness to fight off any challenge to one’s status in the hierarchy of the pack, a belief that men have the right to “spread themselves around” while confining women to “Kinder, Küche, Kirche” (Children, Kitchen, Church), as the old German — and Nazi — saying had it, in order to control their sexuality, and, above all, a desperate need to believe in the ‘rightness’ of rigidly fixed gender roles, characteristics and modes of behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
These connotations are what makes the terms ‘macho’ and ‘machismo’ so ugly. They are as alive and well in North America, the UK and some parts of Europe (particularly the newly ‘liberated’ Eastern Bloc, now freed from the ‘evil gender-equality mandated by Bolshevism’ and returned to traditional sexism) as they are in the Mediterranean lands of their birth and in the cultural colonies of those lands. And they are alive and well here in Australia too, where a football team ‘sharing’ a woman is a ‘bonding exercise’ or a Defence Academy cadet filming himself having sex with another cadet — female, of course — and posting it on the internet is “just a bit o’ fun” and only blameworthy — in the minds of the powers-that-be — because “it might get us sued” and cost money. They are alive and well in the academic pseudo-disciplines of psychology, its bastard-offspring evolutionary-psychology and its even more mutant popularizations such as the work of Louann Brizendine. They are alive and well in <i>many</i> of our institutions of socialization/ideological indoctrination (schools, ‘churches’ and workplaces). And they are alive and well in the media and in popular culture which insists on portraying males and females as radically different from one another in every aspect of their being.<br/>
<br/>
Many men like these connotations because they benefit from them, directly or indirectly — many woman accommodate themselves to them because they see it as a way of ingratiating themselves with men (or simply surviving) [1].<br/>
<br/>
By the same token, when a man tells me that, because I have shown bravery or boldness (‘mahya,’ the Arabic word from which ‘Mafia’ derives), I “have balls,” I am <b>not</b> flattered. Why? Because the phrase implies that courage is the prerogative of testicle-bearers, and assumes that I will be flattered to be considered “one of the boys.” “But what’s wrong with that,” I hear you ask. Well, I could say that I know that I am not <b>really</b> being seen as one of the boys, and never will be — I am being looked on as a man-manqué (an ‘incomplete’ man, ‘crippled’ by her anatomy and thus hampered from ‘full membership’ in the boys’ club), I could ask why the man who thinks that I “have balls” then asks me out (!) — but instead I will ask you to imagine that you are an Australian Aboriginal man 40-50 years ago who does a favour for a person of Anglo-Celtic descent and is met with “Thank you. You’re a real white man.” How would you feel?<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, as a disabled lesbian, I also find ‘lame’ and ‘gay’ offensive when used as terms of derision and abuse.<br/>
<br/>
Faerieloch, I also often play hard-as-nails soldier-types, but they are always recognizably female — they are most definitely never ‘macho.’ I like quoting Stalin on why women make better soldiers than men [yes, he was talking about female snipers, but IMO the point can be extended] — <i>Women ... are less prone to posturing. When a man gets in a fight, he is typically satisfied to see his opponent surrender or run away. War, of course, is not about scaring people; it is about killing them. Some, though not all, men will subconsciously fire over their enemy's heads in the hopes of scaring them off. But women typically just get busy killing</i>. In other words, violence should be a last resort — women will typically look first for other ways of resolving conflict — but once one has decided to be violent, one’s commitment to it should be total.<br/>
<br/>
Turning to another topic — I have never played a male as a PC (male NPCs I can do), mainly because I don’t think I could do so without making an arse of myself. These days I mainly play online — many in my group play cross-gender and some are quite good at it.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>Why can a woman not be macho but a man can be effete?</blockquote>
I think you might be confusing "effete" with "effeminate". Despite that resemblance, the word "effete" has little specific connection with women. It means "exhausted, lacking in vigour", and is derived from a Latin past participle meaning "having produced, having brought forth". "Effete" is no more specifically female than "fetus".                        </div>

                            Wow! I missed this discussion too...<br><br>And I was around when the original ¡Muy Macho! thing started.<br><br>Now, funny thing is I was <b>explicitly</b> alienated from it by <b>the mere fact that I speak Spanish</b>. No, really. <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=446&amp;page=1#Item_7" rel="nofollow">Go back and read the original thing</a>. I have to say that was the part that made me slightly annoyed and made me loose interest in the thread.<br><br>Other than that, I found the term more eye-rolling than funny.<br><br>For context. I am Mexican. In here, "macho" and "machista" are two very different (while sometimes related) concepts.<br><br>"Macho" is the male specimen for an animal species (opposed to "hembra", as in female). Most of the time, people use it to describe someone as "a brute and animalistic person" whose impulses and insctincts overbear his rationality. Specially regarding sexual stuff. (It should be noted that while "macho" is viewed as a light, sometimes playfull, insult, the female equivalent "hembra" is highly rude, and is often related to seeing the women as mere reproductive machines.)<br><br>On the other hand, "machista" is a male prone to the chauvinistic, disrespectful, abusive and superior behaviour that originated all these issues.<br><br>So one can be a "machista" without being a "macho", and one can even be a "macho" without being "machista" (although that happens a lot less often).<br><br>Either way, linking "being brave, bold and masochistic" behavior with the word I'm used to relate to "being overly sexual, irrational and animalistic" seems cartoony, over-the-top and really odd to me.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<blockquote><b>The Muy Macho Credo</b><br/><br/>I am Muy Macho! I am tough enough to take anything you can dish out, and come back for more with a smile. I don't flinch. I jut my shapely chin forward and tap it lightly, I want you to take your best shot. And when you hit me I want it to hurt. I don't pretend it doesn't hurt. I revel in the fact that it hurts, and I can take it. Can you say the same?<br/><br/>I am Muy Macho! I don't want any easy victory. Don't softball me. I want your biggest challenge.

Next time I'll do all the same right back at you, and give you a chance to show that you're Muy Macho like me ... not as much so as me, of course (who could be?) but in the same general vein.

So, way back when Tony came up with this credo, and spelled it out with superlative metaphors which worked for some, and clearly did not work for others. There of course was a lot of tongue-in-cheek in his post, but the core remained solid. Similar credos crept up around the same period (maybe someone else could look up which ones came first, which were reactions to which etc. UPDATE: Looks like Meguey's IWNAY/NGH is from Jan 2006, Muy Macho from April 2006, so the latter was a reaction/addition to the former) like <a href="http://www.fairgame-rpgs.com/comment.php?entry=32" rel="nofollow">I Will Not Abandon You", "Nobody Gets Hurt"</a>, etc. But again, the term Macho was an offputting term to many.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I figure since it's five years later</span></b>, though many of the people in those original threads are infrequent posters nowadays (if at all), <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>maybe we can take a look at the credo again and come up with a new way to express it?</b></span> While I hate the idea of taking the tongue-in-cheekness out of it like an intellectual awkwardly deconstructing a funny joke, the core of the credo is solid (because I see it in play A LOT, and while I embrace it sometimes, I avoid it... well, a lot other times) and I think could use a new way to redescribe this phenomenon/behavior/credo.<br/><br/>Thing is, as I mentioned I do see this "Macho" (again, in quotes for whatever substitution is later provided) behavior at the table sometimes from men and women (urbanpagan/Lisa definitely plays by this credo a lot!). Whether they swear by the Credo or just engage in it without realizing it, it exists. What would be a better term for it?<br/><br/>"Playing Hard"?<br/>"Emotional Heavy Metal"?<br/><br/>The closest I came to describing the credo lately in terms other than "Macho" again referenced guy-parts: <b>"Punch me in the dick as hard as you want! I'll punch yours too!"*</b> But again, something less gender-heavy would be nice.<br/><br/>Turns out that while I like playing this kind of game sometimes (usually confined to one-shots), most of the time I avoid these kinds of games. While I like sweeping change, playing hard, and being challenged, many of the "Muy Macho" games I've been in by necessity devolve into "everyone stabs everyone in the face! The town burns behind us! WOO HOO!" You can see it coming from a mile away like a harakiri scene in a samurai movie. It's a good credo to put a label on, because folks can embrace/avoid it from there.<br/><br/>Perhaps on the riff of IWNAY/NGH, perhaps "Everyone Can Expect to Get Hurt"? <br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* in a game I walked away from feeling unfulfilled, because the Muy-Macho-Creedo came up in some of the players and not others, so basically the game - totally expectedly - ended in fire for four characters and laughing/throwing horns for two characters. Credo clash: It happens.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hi. Three things:<br/><br/>1) As a Peruvian male, and thus a subject that has been inmersed in the latino comunity all my life, I find the use of the archetype totally offensive. Men can be dicks anywhere, so I would rather prefer everybody to use a word for macho in their own language or their local dialect. Were I to play Tony's game here in my country, I would feel free to use the word macho, providing the people I play with feel ok with the term.<br/><br/>2) To all males here interested I would like to propose you an interesting experiment. Perhaps you're not into MMORPGs, but try one for 20 minutes. Create a female character of any class, though it would work better if you choose a race/class that looks like being designed by a total machist. You know, big boobs, no clothing, the whole deal. Interact with male players, make your best impersonation as a female character played by a female player. See how male players react. The first time I tried, it really surprised me, as well as my own reaction to it.<br/><br/>3) To everyone here: RPG games are about things that exist in our mind only, and it's the same for words, and for magic items: they only have the power you give to them. If you put confidence, abuse, strenght and a dick in of shitbag and call it macho, or men, it's your golem and you're giving it that power over you. Don't do it. If it has a dick and acts like one, just call it dick. An abuser is an abuser and an idiot is an idiot. Joining all those terms into a single thing and calling people that gives them the sense of being a group, and that's what makes them really dangerous (in the stupid sense of the word, not the threatening one).                        </div>

                            Oops, in my post above ("This credo clearly exists, whether consciously or unconsciously acted upon") I forgot to repost the credo sans-macho. Here it is. As is, it makes sense. You have perhaps been in games like these. Perhaps you live this credo!<br/><br/>=========================<br/><b>The Credo, Redux</b><br/><br/>ON LINES/VEILS AND EMOTIONAL PAIN: I am tough enough to take anything you can dish out, and come back for more with a smile.

                            I don't think you should cut out the "Can you say the same?" part out.<br/><br/>I think the more-than-just-implied challenge is an important part of the mindset. It is about bringing out the attitude in others, as well as having it yourself.<br/><br/>The bonding section gets to that. But I think the "Can you say the same?" part of the creed drives it in even more strongly and emphasizes a certain style of challenge. A certain special combination of condescension and veiled respect for those who are willing to rise to the challenge.                        </div>
