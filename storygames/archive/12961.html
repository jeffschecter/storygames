I've started working with this 23 year-old woman who has Autism. She's typical-functioning mentally, and lives on her own. My job is basically to help her get out in the community and do what she wants and also to assist her in cleaning her apartment so she can keep living independently.<br/><br/>She's super geeky, walls of manga &amp; anime &amp; gaming books (in fact she was at Kumoricon this weekend and modeled her Edward Elric "crossplay" costume for me--pretty cool). We started talking about D&amp;D today, and she pulled out her 3.5 books and began describing her campaign world at length, and bemoaning her lack of a group. I pointed her to some websites and D&amp;D gaming days, but she would have none of it because "at those gamedays all they want to play is 4th Edition." I asked her what she didn't like about 4E, and she deadpanned, "I heard something horrible. If you hit a skeleton in 4th edition you can get a <i>critical hit</i>." I'm pretty sure she hasn't played any version of D&amp;D, but to her the idea of this was anathema (she also said she doesn't want to have to buy a bunch more books, which is a good reason).<br/><br/>Interacting with her has been fascinating. After the first day I worked with her I left thinking, "she's <i>so much</i> like the worst of the gamer stereotypes--not socially adept at all, obsessive to the point of not being able to have a normal conversation, kinda smelly--damn, maybe all those terrible gamer stereotypes I've met are just autistic!"<br/><br/>I feel for her, because it's not <i>her</i> fault she's autistic, but her autism pretty much means it'll be incredibly difficult to find a gaming group, and I see her pining away over those books and creating things in her mind that she'll likely never get to play out with other people. It's like when you're not gaming regularly and just noodle over your books, but turned up to the max.<br/><br/><b>TL;DR</b>--I work with an autistic woman who wants to get her D&amp;D on but is finding it difficult to find a group because of her disability. So: Is anyone here on the autistic spectrum? Are you gaming? How is it going? Is anyone gaming with someone who has autism? What can I do to help her out? I've thought of suggesting we game during my shifts with her*, but I think it'll take some more time before I win her trust, plus she's really locked into the idea that gaming is a DM + 4 or more people.<br/><br/><br/>*and, well, I don't really want to game with her. It might be fun for an hour or so at work, but really? I'd never invite her over to my house to game, simply because hanging out with her isn't fun.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292140/#Comment_292140" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T21:58:49+00:00" title="September  7, 2010  9:58PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I am. <br/><br/>Though with Asperger's, I'm considered someone on the highly functional end of that spectrum (I did make a comment to that effect in the thread you've referenced).<br/><br/>I've long considered a lot of the same things...are the typical gamer stereotypes simply aspect of the Autism Spectrum that have gone undiagnosed in the individuals who possess them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292142/#Comment_292142" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T22:04:59+00:00" title="September  7, 2010 10:04PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are lots of threads about this on RPG.Net.

Perhaps a game where some players are movers-and-shakers and the others are their henchmen - this way people would play in pairs.  It could work well with children too because players could choose which role in the pair they wanted to be - do you want to be in charge and get a certain amount of spotlight or do you want to be a little more in the background and help out?  It could be good for bringing in new players in general (I could even see a con-game format where you have to bring a new player to be able to play and you're the henchman!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292366/#Comment_292366" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-08T17:37:06+00:00" title="September  8, 2010  5:37PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mease19</cite>Ok, so a natural extension of this discussion is how could you design a game into intersperse autistic and non-autistic players?</blockquote>\nInteresting.

Then, through play, you stat out each other's characters with aspects.  This way you have to pay attention to what others are doing and propose and discuss appropriate aspects for other people's characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292651/#Comment_292651" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T14:01:09+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  2:01PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My son has Aspergers, and one of his biggest issues is competition, time-dependent mechanics, and "losing."

I'm reasonably alert to social cues, have no trouble with conversational back-and-forth, and am generally quite comfortable meeting new people and coming off as socially normal, not "slightly off" in that way even high-end-of-the-spectrum autistics generally seem.<br/><br/>Here's the "but"\u2014and I had an experience today, spending time with non-geek distant relatives, that reinforced this view\u2014<i>I am never going to be able to function at peak social capacity around non-geeks</i>.  There's simply too much of my personality and my identity wrapped up in geekdom of various sorts\u2014and not just gaming\u2014for me to ever be able to completely be myself.<br/><br/>Being a geek of some stripe is its own thing.  It's almost more like an ethnic group or even a religion or maybe even a sexual orientation or gender identity, than it is like a disorder.  There may be nothing "wrong" with a person psychologically, and they still have a certain level of need to be around fellow geeks.  I know I'm not alone in this.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
