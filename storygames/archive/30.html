                            OK...<br/><br/>Shab-al-Hiri Roach is 95% done.  Telepathic roaches enslave humanity.  Readying the draft for preflight at RPI and talking to the card printer, making changes, etc.  Text is locked down.  Note to self:  never make a game that requires cards.<br/><br/>Grey Ranks is 30% done (?).  Teens find death and romance during the 1944 Warsaw uprising.  No art yet, although I've made a deal with Remi to provide same.  No layout.  Rules in flux but ready for some playtesting.  I have a feeling it will come together fast.  <br/><br/>Lots of other small projects that have not become insistent yet.  A complete re-write of Open Boat incorporating what I've learned in the last year is one of these.                        </div>

                            A five page comic for this Hell Script thing I set up with a friend.<br/>
<br/>
Concept sketches for Grey Ranks, moving straight into the finished pieces. This is going to be fucking hot once I figure out how to ink it.<br/>
<br/>
First comic for Biggest Webcomics Loser weight loss thing I'm participating in (but didn't name).<br/>
<br/>
I don't have a game in the works, but I'll probably take a shot if the Ronnies roll around again. Being surrounded by designers make it seem like the natural thing to do.                        </div>

<p><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/suffadv/" rel="nofollow">Sufficiently Advanced</a> is my main project right now. Maybe 25% done in terms of content, but more like 75% in terms of concept and rules. The playable core of the game is there.</p>
<p>Super Console, the successor to <a href="http://www.valentgames.com/console.shtml" rel="nofollow">Console</a>, is about 90% done. Needs editing and a few more pictures, and that's it. (Though lord knows I may decide to change the resolution mechanic, I think I'd rather just get it out at this point.)</p>
<p>Anything relating to my other, older projects (Valence, Minigame, superlink revisions) has been basically taken off the stove and put in the fridge. If I ever want to get anything finished, I need to concentrate rather than spread out. I have a few six-page games on the back burner, but they're really just there for me to practice and try out game mechanics with.</p>
<p>Slowly simmering is the idea of a streamlined d20. I love the concept of epic-level D&amp;D, but hate the execution. Too many little details to keep track of. However, since I know no one's going to care or buy it, I probaly won't ever do anything with it.</p> </div>

                            Good thread idea.<br/><br/>Currently cooking is <a href="http://www.realms.org.uk/covenant" rel="nofollow">Covenant</a>. In which player characters are members of a secret society who prepared for an apocalypse that never happened. Now they have to deal with the fallout from that anti-climax, and answer the question: if everything you believed was a lie, where do you go now? <br/><br/>It needs some hardcore playtesting.

I think I am about 70% done with it.  It is a for sure pre-GenCon release, just not sure how pre...<br/><br/>My feudal board/RPG game is simmering right now.  It is for sure going to be using cards and dynasties and family lines and shit.  A sort of amalgam of the computer game Crusader Kings and a politically driven RPG I've been working on, off and on over the last year.  It is in the way early stages, being like 20% done if that...<br/><br/>Way on the back burner is an Arabian Nights game.  I love that shit and have just started to give it serious thought.  It will either be a CoS build or something entirely new.  It is like 5% done I would say...                        </div>

<p>I'm not going to give you percentages, because they'd all be wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Exemplar (revised)</strong> is my most complete project. Dune-style space opera, plus kung-fu. It's got a functioning rules-set and is going through extensive campaign-style playtesting (I'd do shorter playtests, but some of the key mechanics are centered around campaign play).</p>
<p><strong>(never) ASTROGATE!</strong> has about a third of a rough draft done, and I'm losing interest in it, so it will likely be abandoned onto a burner in the waaay back. Unhappy people steal alien magic, use it to run around the universe, lose touch with their humanity, and find themselves again.</p>
<p><strong>My Ideal Fantasy Heartbreaker</strong> has the draft of its umpteenth incarnation being written up as we type. Unholy but hopefully awesome blend of Burning Wheel and Sorcerer style mechanics with an aesthetic most perfectly captured by a particular high-level D&amp;D story hour called "Tales of Wyre" that you can read on the ENWorld boards, GMed by Sepulchrave II.</p>
<p>And I have this nascent idea for a story game called "University Life" about things blowing way out of proportion, based on Neal Stephenson's novel <em>The Big U</em>.</p>

                            Dictionary of Mu is about 80% done but the rest of what is going to happen is lay-out, art and such, this is like a part of the iceberg that I can't see because I have no idea how it all will work.  <br/>
<br/>
The writing and rules stuff is done, next is just re-write and getting it purty.<br/>
<br/>
First Quest is based on The Shadow of Yesterday's Creative Commons system is about 10% done; I've got just enough to playtest the hell out of it this coming weekend and see how it flies.<br/>
<br/>
A d20 project I am working on is about 80% done, off to the editors.<br/>
<br/>
The Riddle of Blood is about 70% done but now I am thinking of just polishing the TRoS stuff and then switching it all whole hog over to Burning Wheel.  We'll see how it goes.  I'm considering it.<br/>
<br/>
I think that is about where I'm at.<br/>
<br/>
Other 2%er's that are just floating on notepads are a d20 samurai and ninja done right and a tarot based fortune in the middle political fantasy RPG.                        </div>

                            My only real iron in the fire right now is Galactic, a space opera that will hopefully deliver on the promises many previous space adventure games made. You play the captains (and crew) of ships out to rally the galaxy against the onslaught of the Scourge. Lots of tough decisions to make about putting yourself and others at risk.<br/>

It needs heaps of playtesting still, but I can see the end of the tunnel.                        </div>

<a href="http://verge.legendary.org" rel="nofollow">Verge</a> is in a weird state. It's that turkey that is burning on the outside but still needs to be cooked on the inside. I could probably wrap up the writing with a solid weekend's worth of work, but it's lacking something important that I can't put my finger on, so I keep it in the fire. I have to finish the fucker before it becomes a great white whale.<br/><br/>In the 2% arena is my own Fantasy Heartbreaker. It's the rules I'd want instead of Game of Thrones RPG, but for my own fantasy world. I started writing it when I finally had it with trying to get Nar play out of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Also in the 2% arena is a fantasy game about young heroes in a village whose elders believe the heroes are destined to destroy the dragon that plagues it. The game will be about growing into a hero, learning from mentors, finding courage in odd places, and understanding companionship and loved ones. The game will have an end-game where the heroes get to use what they learned as tools to fight the dragon.<br/><br/>I finished a 24-hour RPG this summer. <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Trapped.php" rel="nofollow">Trapped!</a> is a comedy horror game played with cards instead of dice. It's done, as far as I'm concerned. I've never played it.                        </div>

<i>Perfect Blossom</i>, my "magical girls meet <i>Evangelion</i> in a dark alley, hijinks ensue" game, has moved out of "jumble of notes" to "organized jumble of notes" to "this sucks, must rewrite" and back to "jumble of notes."

                            Shreyas - only 98% of real-world time to go!<br/>Seriously, things are complicated with this because the idea was an outgrowth of the cricket game (Manservants are cool....crazy toffs are cool...ahhhhh....) that came from a conversation between me and a friend, and we thought we'd develop it together. As such, we've both sat on it, scared, I think, to work on it without sanction from the other. Totally dumb, and I should just thwack out a draft to throw at him, with the instruction to tear it to pieces or do one better.                        </div>

                            I'm in a weird space regarding projects now.  I'm working full-time at a major university, and from that I get free classes, so I'm taking two fiction classes in the evenings.  As such, my time went to pretty much nil.<br/><br/>However, I had a 2% for a GenCon <i>MIdway City</i> LARP.  However, that 2% is just an outline of how to plan such an event, and as it's almost February and I haven't even written the plot yet, let alone 50 characters, I might scrap this.<br/><br/>I'm about 30% on the first two suppliments for <i>Midway City</i>.<br/><br/>I'm poking at <i>Cartoon Action Hour: Season 2</i> with Cynthia, which is around 15%.<br/><br/>On the backburner are <i>Streets of Blood</i> (a crime drama game using Chad's PDQ mechanics), <i>One Night Stand</i> (a line of games for "casual roleplaying," easy to pick up, read, make characters for, and play in a few hours), as well as a few ideas that could shake out to be games or fiction.                        </div>

<em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> is written, in playtest, without art or layout, and details of manufacture still in the air.  It's a steampunk space opera game with a heavy emphasis on characterization, which drives the story and gameplay.<br/><br/><em>Dynasty</em> is written, playtested, with art, and laid out, but I can't find a manufacturing solution for a full-color card game that fits within my budget.  So it's hanging out on the back burner.  It's a pseudo-European pseudo-Enlightenment game of politics and backstabbing.<br/><br/><em>Shadows and Strings</em> is in total 2% territory, mostly because I can't decide if I actually want to develop it into a real product.  It's a game of supernatural conspiracies which actually plays as supernatural conspiracies and not superpowered avatars using kewl powers to kill things.                        </div>

                            Shock: Social Science Fiction is 90% done. It's a game based on the writings of Bruce Sterling, Ray Bradbury, Ursula K. LeGuinn. It's being tweaked in playtest now and it hasn't yet been typeset. Not to mention the fact that I haven't even decided about illustrations.<br/>
<br/>
Absinthe, a game of utopian hope and the magic needed to make it happen, is just starting out. I'll say 1%. It's about making the world one of Freedom, Love, Beauty, and Truth vs. one of crushing mundanity. Protagonists are artists in Montmartre on December 31, 1899 a the stroke of midnight as the 20th century begins.<br/>
<br/>
Arete: Heroic Science Fiction, a science fantasy game drawing from Star Wars, Barsoom, Flash Gordon, and the like, is in its barely zygotic stage. It follows the Campbellian Cycle, giving players resources based on their enaction of their destinies, possibly versus temptations that draw one from that destiny.<br/>
<br/>
Crackpot is in about the same place. It's a game of competing conspiracy theories, where tests of theory are in flight from Their actions. The way to succeed is by passing on the information you've learned or by becoming part of the Conspiracy itself. It's largely about holding on to your (increasingly crazy) view of the universe vs. falling prey to easy explanations.<br/>
<br/>
Xenon: Mind-Blowing Science Fiction is a mystery to me. I know I want it to be based on Rudy Rucker and 1940s science fiction, where there's an idea to explore, but I don't have any idea how to make it work. No frickin' idea.                        </div>

<p><em>Ninegun Choir.</em><br/>
That's my mystery - exiled angels doing freelance dirty work (administering tests of faith, working with and against the Adversary, creating Earth in the image of Heaven) in the mortal world to earn back their prestigious jobs in Heaven.</p>
<p>I know I want to use anime-style elaborate magic circles in this one, and something like the sephiroth diagram as spiritual-anatomy-and-battle-map. No dang clue.</p>

                            I'm with Sheyas.  Burning with anticipation for the Wodehouse game. Toss the draft, Alex.  Tell your friend we sent you. : ) <br/><br/><i>Shooting the Moon</i> is on the top. This is the love triangle game where two suitors are competing for the hand of a shared beloved.  I'd put it at the 70% mark with the resolution system needing to be finalized.  That still leaves the writing/layout etc, but since it will be in a very similar format to BtI, I think that should be smooth (famous last words, eh?).<br/><br/><i>City of the Moon</i> is at primary playtest stage. Court intrigue &amp; artistic endeavour in the Classical Japanese imperial court.  It's at, what, 40%? Maybe less. This game will need some serious research &amp; writing, and art. (Still looking for the artist, though I've got some good leads).  I'm thinking the final product will be primarily meant for pdf sales, with a short run of heart-breakingly beautiful, artisan-level artifact publication as the only print. <br/><br/><i>World by the Tail</i> invaded my brain of recent &amp; won't go away. It's a detective fiction/noir game where one player plays the detective &amp; the rest of the players run the clients, police, criminals etc that try and cozy up to the Dick or take him down.  Despite finding out that Clinton had the same idea (!!), I'm stuck on the game.  I actually found some great rummy-based mechanic ideas at Dreamation, thanks to Ben's amazing suggestions so it seems worth pursuing.  Lots of character death in this one.                        </div>

                            I only have 2%ers, myself.<br/><br/><i>The Lion, the Witch, and the Armoire</i> (tentative title) my reaction to a friend's question about how to run the first Narnia book as an rpg/adventure. A week or so of furious creativity put out some neat character creation/relationship rules (Defining your characters primarily relative to each other. fairly similar to some of the things Emily is doing in her Moon games, actually), some ideas for shaping the structure of the story, and a liberal stealing from MLWM to deal with the one or two characters who are entrapped by the Witch. Actually, this is more in the 10-15% range; it's just missing a good conception of situation creation and structure.<br/><br/>The real 2%er doesn't have a title, but was based on the anime/manga <i>X</i>. Flashy, high-powered magicy people duke it out to either save or destroy [and thus cause the rebirth of] Japan. Magic combat mechanics looking a lot like Riddle of Steel's sword fights, sacrificing your life to undo the other side's accomplishments, that sort of stuff. I should really go take another stab at it; I last worked on it pre-Dogs, pre-PTA, and pre-many other good influences.                        </div>

                            Hi there.<br/><br/><b>Beast Hunters of ChelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢qhur</b> is in playtest stage.  I have some revisions and additions that need to be put into a new draft.  ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Gamist design about tribal hunters that seek out and slay magical beasts, then use their preyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blood for ritual tattoos that increase their powers.  On a player level, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about addressing challenges in a creative, player-empowered way.  That includes negotiation between Ã¢â‚¬Å“GMÃ¢â‚¬Â and player, limited GM budget, and plenty of reinforcement for creative actions.  I plan to finish and publish it this year, but recently it had to take a back seat to my novel.<br/><br/><b>Epic</b> needs to be written into a draft, but the rules are all done.  ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a story game that has its roots more in collaborative writing and freeform play.  No GM, players have currency to create characters and facts.  Characters can be minor, major, or agonists, with different numbers of traits, and the important ones also having driving passions.  Conflict resolution allows weighting of two things: winning the particular conflict vs. changing the opposing character (including creating handicaps and influences, or even changing fundamental traits).  Subsystems of trait types and rewards are chosen by each play group and serve as flags; currently they are "Combat and Violence," "Sex and Romance," "War and Conquest," and "Politics and Intrigue."  IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m quite excited about the simple yet powerful mechanics, but need to playtest it to see if they work out.<br/><br/><b>Power/Evil</b> is my exploration of challenge, competitive Gamist design.  In it, you play an evil force of great power that, after defeating good, vies for supremacy with other evil forces (i.e., the other players).  I have an older draft, but I figured out that it was not an RPG after all.  IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m playing around with certain things to see if I can make it an RPG, but I might just publish it as a competitive strategy game that uses fiction as a fun-enhancer.  This is the design that several random people downloaded and playtested with their group for hours on end, so I think the idea of the game appeals to many people.<br/><br/><b>torn</b> (which, yes, is written all lower-case) was my first attempt at creating a Narrativist game.  I still think it has promise, especially with its expansion of the relationship map feature, but I havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t put any effort into it in a while. Its rules have a few holes.  ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about people who control a dark force; basically, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very Sorcerer, but it has a more direct way of forcing tough choices upon the players. Not sure when I'll get back to this one.<br/><br/>Those are all the ones worth mentioning.<br/><br/>- Christian                        </div>

                            50% - Carry. Tentative subtitle: Can <i>you</i> handle Vietnam? Dreamation lit the fire under my ass for it, and I plan to have a full rewrite done fairly soon. Then I will playtest, send out for playtesters, and start looking for artists. Aiming for summer release if I can't go to Gencon, and if I can I might hold off till the big one cuz all the cool kids do it.<br/><br/>7% - The Imp Of The Perverse. My attempt at combining the awesome parts of the 2nd Ed. D&amp;D Masque Of The Red Death setting with my love of Poe and proto-Gothic fiction (i.e. Dracula). Stealing a lot from Wraith and other games as well. Everyone plays a character with a perversity, the Imp of which is played by another player. You travel the world battling monsters. If you give in to your Imp, you become one yourself. Good times. Pie In The Sky Ambition: write the text in Poe-esque prose through the lens of a departed spirit dictating the game to a modern writer. <br/><br/>2% - Kildarrin. My fantasy/Shadowrun heartbreaker. I work on it for about an hour every so often. It's gonna be all about racism, if it ever gets written.<br/><br/>1% - Timestream Companion. Free PDF with better examples, fleshed out alternate settings, and examples of and guides to common time travel scenarios, as well as a more robust R-Map mechanic and better Out Of Time minigame. Might end up happening after Carry's release.                        </div>

                            Funny, I haven't had time to talk about my games because I'm actually in the middle of working on one of them. I've put about 3-4 solid hours a night on this for the past three days, and I've got a fuckload of work ahead of me.<br><br>That game is <b>Tenra Bansho Zero</b> ---&gt; www.tenra-rpg.com  It's kicking my ass with its awesome moments, because for the fact that it was produced originally 9 years ago (Zero edition was 2000) it's got enough story-game like mechanics that it looks like a Forge-spawned game of 2005/6. But every once in a while I stumble onto something that's clearly thrown in for sim, and it makes me pause a bit.  Luckily, I have full control of the text, so I'm literally "correcting" bits that I think should be corrected as I go.  But it's slow going.  I've promised the Chapel Hill Meetup group that there will be a playtest next month, and damned if I'm not going to have somethng ready by then, even if it involves a little drift.<br><br>Tenra is about 30% done in terms of "having a manuscript", but probably 10% done in terms of "until you see it on your gaming shelf".<br><br>Considering that it looks like what happens when a truck of RIFTS crashes into a boat of PTA, I'm eagerly looking forward to playing it.<br><br/>Here are my other ideas and projects, originally stated way back here (fuck, that was LAST MAY???):<br/><a href="http://zigguratbuilder.livejournal.com/3078.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://zigguratbuilder.livejournal.com/3078.html</a><br/><br/><b>Gun Dream Apocalypse</b> is a "2%" project. It's a post-apoc kung fu Sorcerer supplement.  The only thing I need to do is Sin City-ify it. In its previous incarnations, it looked and played out too much like Superheroes for my refined "players make up their own directions" taste. It will probably be begun in 2007, way after Tenra and The Ghost Killers.<br/><br/><b>ODEUM</b> is another 2%'er: Basically it's the tabletop version of Tenra Bansho with all the skills, attributes and gear torn out so that only the "acting parts" exist.  Or, another way to describe it is "PTA, but for Theatre instead of TV". A game for theatre fag wannabes like me.<br/><br/><b>Penultimate Tactical Fantasy</b> is Awesome in concept (5%), but it is now on the back burner until I get further through Tenra and finish The Ghost Killers.<br/><br/><b>The Ghost Killers</b> is 20% done in terms of "until you see it on the shelf". I basically took Rafael Chandler's Dread and rewrote it, slapping in some serious Silent Hill and the manga/anime Bleach (just the good parts, that is to say "Not much: just the backdrop"). It has a "Chicken" style mechanic, a Team Sheet for group tracking of group goals and equipment (it's a shared character sheet) with a mechanic that plays out like watching middle-management politics at your company, and two resolution mechanics, one task and one conflict. Oh, and it uses all d8s.  After that, though, it's 'traditional': One GM, X players, go on adventures, etc.  It's my fantasy heartbreaker, but just set in a modern world with horror. I'm looking forward to playtesting this again, but I need to push forward on Tenra first.<br/><br/>I plan on having demos of TGK and Tenra ready for the Forge Midwest gathering in April.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I'm working on a couple of major things and have a few kicking around at the back of my mind. Although since I've for now stopped my regular gaming group I don't know what will happen to them.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Chanter</b> This is the one I'm actively developing at the moment. It's undergoing rather a refit from the ground up. I've got some really nice subsystems for it, but connecting them together and filling out the requireded details is proving tricky. No writeup or playtesting has happened as yet.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Great Ork Gods</b> Design wise it's finished, text wise it's 80% of the way there. I'm waiting on my brother to pull his finger out and finish my artwork so I can get the layout done and start selling a final version.<br/>
<br/>
Less concrete games:<br/>
<br/>
<b>Witch Hunter</b> I got really enthused about this for about a week and then lost all interest.<br/>
<br/>
<b>A Fantasy Thingy</b> I've always wanted to write a game that is fun in the same way that I remember all those old D&amp;D / Dragon Warriors / MERPs games being but without rules that make me cry. I have bits and pieces of thought about this but I've never been clear enough about it to make it work.                        </div>

                            85% - Pundits &amp; Pollsters - Lameass game about zany political crap, using voting as a resolution mechanic. I'm not sure I like it, but it took me four years to write it and I'm too stubborn to quit at this point. It needs proofreeding, art, and then all the layout crap.<br>
<br>
10% - Gods - A game about mythology and world-building and yadda yadda. The percentage was a lot higher, then I scrapped it because the rules sucked big time. I'm starting over using Capes as a foundation (with Tony's blessing). It has yet to be determined whether it's going to be a standalone or a Capes supplement. I know exactly what I'm going to do with this, I need to start writing.<br>
<br>
5% - Comrade Jesus vs. the Mutants - This was an idea for an Iron Game Chef that I never actually worked on, but like so much that I'm going to do something with it some day. At its core, it's going to be a game about normal humans who help carry some super-warrior while they fight an unending battle, and encourage them to keep going when it seems hopeless. I have some notes scribbled down, but not much more.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<b>Illegal Gods</b>, my space-opera game is at about 30%...and I'm playing with typesetting rather than rules because I'm still not sure what resolution system to use, even if I have most of the setting and character types set.

                            Heh.  'Cause, you know, I've never quite gotten the hang of Thursdays.  <b>Mokuyobi</b> introduces three new PC races (something kind of like an anthropomorphic camel group, the spider folk (far more playable than Driders or any of the previously published ones I've run across, IMO), and a variant of the elves), and three new classes (a wizard-type that takes illusionists into necromancy, a wandering healer/poisoner-monk style, and a technomancer type) in a landscape highlighted by the remnants of a great civil war between the people and their Gods.  Pretty standard, peppered with references and remnants of what I remember from my Japanese studies, but still unlike any Earth history.                        </div>

<code>Pretty standard, peppered with references and remnants of what I remember from my Japanese studies, but still unlike any Earth history.</code><br/>Interesting!  Yeah, when I get a little further down the road, check out that Tenra Bansho game I've been talking about.  It's... out there.  Like a high-SF/Spiritual Fantasy version of the Sengoku period, on another planet. It looks like some weird RIFTS clone but plays out very much like PTA (I think I mentioned that, but still)...                        </div>

                            Shreyas, what about the Brahmana game? <br/>
<br/>
I'm currently working on something that, as usual, is really more of a mass of mechanics thrown together to see what they might do. Meaning that I have some general ideas for the genre of the game, but that the linkages between the mechanics and the genre/setting stuff is, at best, weak. <br/>
<br/>
Other than that, it's an attempt to create a largely hybrid game for all three genres that basically involves mechanical compartmentalization on linkage. Set in an ancient city of intrigue, politics, and clashing belief systems (magic). <br/>
<br/>
How's that for vague? <br/>

<p>Oh yeah, I have <em>stuff</em> that's in my "unfinished games" folder; the game we talked about, maybe I'm not gonna work on it for a while, until I have some emotional distance from the topic. I'm still too attached to making it a game that I'd be unwilling to play, and I'm <em>damned</em> if I let myself write something like that.</p>

<b>This Is Pulp</b> takes place in an alternative 1930 with forgotten Inka pyramids, Nazis, jungle, wild chases, hungry dinosaurs, gigantic robots and it's major inspiration comes from movies such as Indiana Jones, King Kong, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, King Solomon's Mines, Tintin and Rocketeer. You can play it without any prep, explain the rules while you play, it's perfect for introducing beginners, takes around 40-90 minutes from when you sit down and when you are finished, if a player rolls a bad roll it's more difficult for the player and not the character (<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17413/creating-non-random-obstructions-for-the-players" rel="nofollow">descriptive challenges</a>!), the rules are more narrative structures than rule mechanics, and the book is short and full of inspiration (by using tropes). The game is finished but not written down and I'm waiting for some illustrations so it's perhaps 50% done.                        </div>

                            I'm still stuck at 25% of the system I'm designing. I'm using generic medieval fantasy for the setting for now, but once I'm sure the systems works (that would be like, at 60%), I'll replace all the content with original content, perhaps Mochika derived, something inspired on Books of Magic or perhaps a mix of those.<br/><br/>System is card based, with one deck for the players and one or two decks for the GM. It's designed to facilitate GMing and reducing prep time for both GM and players.                        </div>

                            WOW!<br/><br/><b>Serpent's Tooth</b> is a one shot where we tell a story about a King falling from power. The thing is that the King is also the GM. As they fall from power they also lose their GM authority. I've been working on it for the last year and a half. It is all done now (finally!) and being shipped to my house in big boxes.<br/><br/><b>Suspended Animation</b> is a solitaire game about being a navigator of a colony ship. The Beta is done and has had some play. I have some ideas for the final version but I am kinda wavering.<br/><br/><b>HVE Water </b>(pronounced Heavy Water) was my game chef contribution this year. In it one of us plays a survivor lost in the woods after the apocalypse. The rest of us play their loved ones. The loved ones have a GM like role. The game is this slow day by day account of how the survivor survives and also of their memories of the loved ones.  I'm pretty psyched about this, I played one session so far and had a total blast.<br/><br/> </div>

<b>Magical Burst</b> is the dark magical girl RPG I've been working on that's inspired by <i>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</i>, though it has a lot of other stuff in it. It's getting there, and I'd say it's at maybe the halfway mark, with heavy playtesting needed. It's generated a ton of interest in places like the 4chan /tg/ board, which has kept me motivated to keep working on it.<br/><br/><b>Dragon World</b> is my "90s comedy fantasy anime" hack of Apocalypse World. It's been a ton of fun to play so far, though it needs some more fine-tuning in places and just more playtesting in general. <b>Galaxy World</b> is a thing I've brainstormed for a tiny bit and not much else, which would basically be Dragon World for sci-fi.<br/><br/><b>Raspberry Heaven</b> is a game in the vein of slice of life 4-panel manga about high school girls (Azumanga Daioh, Hidamari Sketch, etc.). Mechanically it's kind of like "happy Fiasco," and I want to make it into an RPG/smartphone app hybrid thing.<br/><br/><b>Slime Story</b> takes place in a world like ours except that magical portals opened up all over the place and started spilling out monsters like something out of a cute Korean MMO. Monster parts have all kinds of uses, some of them downright miraculous, and while in some parts of the world there are wars fought over them and such, in suburban America kids hunt monsters as a hobby and sell the parts to the local Monster Mart. It's a weird mix of tactical combat and slice of life storytelling, and the rules need a ton of work.<br/><br/>I'd intended <b>Slime Quest</b> to be a spinoff to come after Slime Story, but it may end up coming first. Basically it'll be the D&amp;D-esque fantasy RPG that's exactly how I want it, with simpler, quicker tactical combat, some character-based mechanics and conflict resolution stuff, and a blatant anime/JRPG aesthetic. Lots and lots of work to do on that one.                        </div>

<b>I have a RPG that is a Board Game that is an RPG.</b><br/>Tentatively titles "Sceleratus"<br/>Basically it is an player driven (I call it "Allmost GM'less) RPG  of Steampunk adventurers trying to run a crew of thieves. <br/><br/>But, you know those little rules in RPG's on how to do Chase Scenes, making money with the "Day to Day" stuff, Duels of Wits, Wars, miniatures combat, and so on. Well, I broke them out into full board games that are fun enough to play by themselves. <br/><br/>So you can play the board games as part of an ongoing adventure similar to something like Mansions of Madness. Or you can use the tools I have created to make your own story. <br/><br/>Need to resolve a war that you are in command of? <br/>Why not play a (quick) game of Risk to resolve it? <br/><br/>It works, we have played it a  lot! Right now it is in the "Make it readable for everyone else" stage. <br/>Now I just need to deal with crazy real life stresses so I can stay focused. <br/><br/><b>I also have a "War" board game I have been working/playing with. </b><br/><br/>It is what I call a "Persistent World" board game. The things that happen in one game will translate over into the next game. This plays out similarly to Mechaton, and uses rules similar to Marvel Heroic. At the start of every "Campaign" the deck of cards are secretly sorted in a very specific way to create a series of events that are prescripted for the next 1-5 games into small decks that are revealed during play. The decks for the next games are already sorted and secretly placed in an envelope to be revealed for the next game. The cards and score cards that players earn go into a dossier file that can be saved for the next game. <br/><br/>The game is really neat with the way players take on different roles that completely change the way that they interact with the game. Just because it is about a war does not mean it is about miniatures combat, many times you will resolve things through diplomacy, deals with other players, or manipulation of the economy. <br/><br/>The part I have to figure out is the mechanics that create the story for all the things that are going on. My group can do it without rules since they are veteran story gamers, but I need something a lot more concrete for a board game.                         </div>

<b>Kim and Marshall </b> is my game about the semi-fictional relationship between the rapper Eminem and his wife. It's on its second solid playtest draft, and ready for some test driving.

<blockquote>BTW anyone else notice that Tenra has been in production for SIX YEARS!?</blockquote>
Seven, actually! That whole story is revealed in the tell-all "Director's Cut" book thing.<br/><br/>Let me look back upon that list!<br/><b>Tenra Bansho Zero</b> - Last bits of bugfixes, about 3-4 weeks to submitting for proof.<br/><br/>Gun Dream Abocalypse - Wow. I don't remember this one At All.<br/><br/>ODEUM - This was such an awesome idea at the time, and I actually worked out all the rules in my head! Then I forgot to write them down. Then I forgot about the project. But from time to time remembered it. Thing is, there's always PTA. And now Archipelago. <br/><br/>Penultimate Tactical Fantasy - I had so many cool background notes for the setting and all, but ultimately could not answer one question satisfactorily: This game emulates an awesome genre of console RPGs called "Simulation RPG" (They use the loanword Simulation in game genres to mean "Strategy"), a game where one person controls 4-20 characters at once and has them attack and stuff. But ultimately, in a game where one person controls say 10 characters at once, and they can fall pretty easily in combat (to which you have to manage the remaining guys carefully), how is that fun in a paradigm of "everyone controls one character and does the same thing?" (it wasn't)<br/>Then D&amp;D 4e came out, which was surprisingly close to what I was looking for anyway.<br/><br/>The Ghost Killers - Shelved. I still have ideas for it, but needed to move on with other stuff for a while.<br/><br/>===============<br/><br/>Currently, I am working on no single game design of my own, but rather in the translation and production of designs or games much greater than my own thoughts:<br/><br/>* Tenra Bansho Zero, out in a few months.<br/>* Ryuutama, out in a few months (as above) plus six months.<br/>* Shinobigami, out in a few months (as above) plus perhaps eight months.<br/><br/>Also working on the details of publishing someone else's dark teenage superhero-action game.<br/><br/>And in the recesses of my mind, I've got a game idea based on the SRS system, think "Japanese d20 but more Final-Fantasy-esque". Setting is more-or-less hammered out, I just now need the ability to actually shit time.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Oh, man, this is a great thread to necro! <br/><br/>I'm really struggling to refine my Game Chef entry Monsters of Glam, the "Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars RPG". It is at around 10% *maybe*, but I can't seem to settle on where to take it from here. I pin the failing mainly on self discipline and morale.<br/><br/>In the 2% category, I still have a fondness for my 2009 Little Game Chef entry "Chained", and have been toying with an idea for "Musket Patrol", a Danger Patrol hack for The Three Musketeers/Phoenix Guard.                        </div>

This sounds cool. I've been looking a lot lately myself at how board games work, but that's because I want to minimize both the rules and the length (in both play time and number of pages) of a RPG.                        </div>

Thanks!<br/>And it has been really fun the last few times we have played it. The biggest problem I am having is making the mini games generic enough to fit several situations, without making them boring in their own right. One of the big points of the game for me was that "Playing" (Roll Playing) was fun enough that you could that in a session if no one had the energy to bring the story. <br/><br/>My groups will regularly play a board game to fill time, or if someone does not have the energy for one of our crazy story games. But we would still really like to advance the plot of the game.  <br/><br/> </div>

                            Criterion City is nearing Beta Test(however long that takes), I would put a link to the original document but the mechanics have nothing in common with the current rules. The premise is you play a bunch of super powered people in a city with no memories, plagued by being seeking to destroy it. Based very much on Dark City and Big O, with a dollop of Hancock and The Bourne Identity.<br/><br/>Also working on War In The Heavens, a scientific opera set in mankind's far future. But that is a ways off yet.                        </div>

                            Right this minute, I'm taking a break from working on the gamma draft of <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/14472/left-coast-a-game-about-writers-inspired-by-the-life-of-philip-k-dick/p1" rel="nofollow">Left Coast</a>: I'm re-editing it after a round of external playtesting, and two editors looking over it. All of their feedback has helped me see where, how and why to simplify the rules. At the moment, I'm breaking apart the way I present the rules and restructuring it. I'd say I'm probably 40% of the way to releasing the gamma draft - probably by the end of the year; definitely by mid-January 2013.<br/><br/>After releasing <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17313/bad-family-a-comedy-game-about-animated-family-sit-coms/p1" rel="nofollow">Bad Family</a> (and I feel like I'm still going through my link-to-it-annoyingly-frequently phase), I consider that to be simmering. It's a playtest draft: it works when I run it, and now I'm keen to see if and how it breaks for others. I'd say that's simmering at the moment.<br/><br/>My<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16874/my-life-with-master-want-to-playtest-a-3-hour-convention-scenario/p1" rel="nofollow"> how to run My Life with Master scenario</a> is out with playtesters at the moment. It feels about 90% there, and I'll probably pick up work on that in the new year.<br/><br/>After that, the next two games I really want to be working on are Apocalypse World hacks. One's called <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?PHPSESSID=896o3u1q9m9pf7lutrb268f4cs578ecs&amp;topic=1670.0" rel="nofollow">Threat Level</a>, and it'll fulfil my desire for a military-espionage-conspiracy game in the same vein as 24. The other is a very realistic and (hopefully) educational hack called Workplace Bully: this one, I've been mulling over for a while and I think it'll push the Apocalypse World engine in a cool direction.                        </div>

                            I've got three things cooking.<br/><br/><b>Blank Board</b> is an ipad android touch screen app that will allow you to load a board game board, counter, rules and scenario and play a game on multiple devices. This will allow us to make an on line community to play new designs easily. With some tweaks it will provide a POD like easy way to get board games onto the Apple app store. It just allows you to move counters around on a board but I think it could be a game changer in board game making. It will go up on Kickstarter once I know it works.<br/><br/><b>Fairy Tale Assassin League</b> is a story telling card Engle Matrix game in which Coen Bro like fairytale characters try to take out the big bad wolf, the evil queen, and other villains. I have the rules down, I need to work out the character mix and I need art.<br/><br/><b>Rodents with Explodants</b> is a card based Engle Matrix game about lab rats gone wild. I have the rules 75% down but need art and to figure out the exact card mix. We did a play test last night that was a hoot.<br/><br/>I'm slowly working on the art for Snapshot: Iraq, a game about the recent war. It could be for hobby uses but I more see it as a PTSD therapy game.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>

I have played an early playtest version of this game. It is sweet and rocking, both! I'm not that familiar with mystery-RPGs, but this game does the genre in a really cool way, and you really feel like you're solving a mystery.<br/><br/>There is a mechanic where anyone can Draw The Pistol (a toy gun) from the Detective at any time, at which point men with guns enter the scene. Radalicious. I hope you finish this, Morgan.<br/> </div>

                            Hmm.  Simmering on a back burner is my hack of Lady Blackbird: <b><i>Lady BLASTbird,</i></b> a space opera comedy based on a series of short stories and an novel I've been working through for years.  The sticking point for me is release of the characters and setting under a Creative Commons license for gaming purposes while still protecting my IP for fiction publication purposes.  I just haven't thought the issue through enough, but I'd welcome any feedback from the folks here.  I ran this at NemoCon with as stellar a group of players as you could imagine, and it rocked, even though (or because) it was <i>very</i>...politically incorrect.<br/><br/>Parenthetically, I plan to use Nanowrimo to work on a Blast novel I can shop around. My friend Jay Lake is fighting colon cancer, and he's a big booster of the Blast stories, so I want to get this done for him.  You take what you can get in terms of empowerment in the face of a friend's mortality, I guess.<br/><br/>Given all the World of Dungeons play experience I've had lately, I've also been tinkering with <b><i>World of Exalted,</i></b> because, well, porting Exalted away from its horrible native system is one of my kinks.<br/><br/>On top of that, I've been sitting on my fantasy Ghost/Echo hack: <b><i>Imperishable</i></b>, despite kind encouragement from John and Ben.  I really do need a Galactus-sized boot in the ass.<br/><br/>BTW, rereading this thread rekindled my interest in Levi's game <i>The Exchange</i>.  Putting that out there.                        </div>

                            Current projects:<br/><br/><b>The Planarch Codex: Dark Heart of the Dreamer.</b> A plane-jumping sourcebook for Dungeon World. 90% done. Currently in external editing.<br/><br/><b>Stage One: Volume One.</b> An anthology of four short experimental games inspired by video games, with Pat Kemp, Scott Slomiany, Jackson Tegu, Mike Olson, and Evan Silberman. 70% done. Currently in internal dev.<br/><br/><b>Metrofinal.</b> A subway eschaton. Worked on this game for 5+ years. Game mechanics are pretty much done. Working draft is written, but probably need to write a new version of the rules, then redo layout. Maybe 55% of the way to being a final product.<br/><br/><b>Fingers on the Firmament.</b> White whale project I've been thinking about for 10+ years, space fantasy with zero technology. Travel between the stars by reaching out and grabbing them. Try not to get lost. Ran first prototype at PAX, nailed down a couple of killer apps. Quazi-playable but a long way to go. Maybe 15%?<br/><br/><b>Humble Ecologies</b> [working title]. New project to make a non-fiction game where you enact seasonal changes in the natural world without any humans at all. Conceptually sound, I think, though the underlying mechanics and structure still needs a fair amount of work. Might make a prototype just to play it soon. 5%.<br/><br/>Other things not actively developing right now: <b>Due Vigilance</b> (true crime vigilantes), a game for playing adventures in Republic City (from the <i>Legend of Korra</i> TV show), <b>The Afterborn</b> (young adult <i>Apocalypse World</i>), probably a half-dozen other projects that aren't totally dead yet.                        </div>

                            Almost embarrased to post this here, as mention of the Monomyth makes some people roll their eyes. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> But, I've been experimenting with the monomyth structure as a way to elicit solo play that results in a structured tale. I have a pretty long draft on my blog (not published yet).  I was working on it after testing the raw idea in a sort of off the seats of my pants way (the sessions are published in my blog).  However, I have put work on it aside for a few months now.                         </div>

                            I'm exactly at the 50% point on transmissions for <b>Hexnoir</b>, one of the Technoir kickstarter rewards. It's pretty easy to calculate, since there are three to write, with a specific number of items in each (36). One's complete and one has 18 of 36 items written.<br/><br/>I'd say I'm at the 30% point with <b>Slingtown</b>, my Technoir/AW hack. Core rules are written, and playtests have gone well, but I need to actually write out large swaths of the final book/product, since I can't ship a copy of my brain with the game.                        </div>

                            I've been gnawing on <i>Measure of a Badass</i>, my action-movie light mechanics sim game, for about a year now.  Its parent system, OneShot, is three years old.  It's about bringing the black-and-white gonzo action style from the '80s and early '90s into the present day.<br/><br/>We've playtested the damn thing probably two dozen times, and it's tight, but I keep ending up with that persistent fear of there being something missing/wrong, especially as I learn more and more about mechanics and the Fruitful Void (cf. John Harper).  A rewrite is tempting, but we've learned that lesson in my occupational field (software engineering -- anyone remember why we don't use Netscape anymore?  They threw away their entire codebase and rewrote the thing over the course of years, and all the lessons learned along with it, and ended up pushing their release cycle so far back that they lost their market share and never recovered.)<br/><br/>The manuscript has been hovering at 90-95% for months now, and the game's solid, but I still need to do the last bit of translation from "game as I run it" to "game as written in the rules".  I'm half tempted to just say "hell with it", fire off a beta, and duck and cover against the ensuing chaos.                        </div>

<br/>I've played all of these (though it's been years since I've seen 0 Hunters in action). <i>Dead Ruin</i> is pretty sweet; a fast tactical minis game that uses cards in an innovative way that serves both tactics and speed. It also has an interesting (potential) product/distro model, which would make me excited to buy it.<br/><br/><i>Island Surf</i> is something else entirely. It strikes me as the kind of design where the core of it just jumped into the designer's head in a flash (is that true, Tyler?). You know those little Tech Deck finger skateboards? Imagine you played a tabletop game with them, only they were surfboards! Really simple and rad. It's the kind of game you play and think, "how could this not have existed already?"<br/><br/>Good luck, Tyler!                        </div>

                            Been kicking around <i>Leagues of America,</i> an anti-superhero game. Not an anti-hero game. More that the opposition player plays characters recognizable as "superheroes," by rules that mirror those of all the superhero RPGs I hate, where it matters to the system whether the Hulk could beat up Superman. The PCs are characters who stand philosophically and mechanically against all that. Current status: wondering if I shouldn't just make a KPFS-equivalent for supers instead.<br/><br/>Just today I had a pretty breakthrough idea for a combat system based on Chris Kubasik's old <a href="http://www.rpg.net/oracle/essays/itoolkit1.html" rel="nofollow">Interactive Toolkit articles</a> for Inphobia, specifically the idea that hit points are an obsolete holdover from wargaming and the study that found "there are three effects of being shot: Death, Shock or Nothing." It was originally going to be for a dungeon-crawl game. Current status: fun to work on when I get an idea, but has nothing to do with any of my play goals.<br/><br/>Also finishing up a <i>Smallville</i> game soon and having lots of feels about what my play goals are, or indeed if I still have any.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/hans">@hans</a><br/>Strangely enough island surf has took a very long time to get right, the first version was years ago and terrible. It was only a little bit ago that I figured out the right combination of bits and pieces to make it work well. I'm still adjusting things like penalties for fouls and am currently testing a different surface finish for the marbles. the core idea was based on how ancient people moved large stones for building (island surf was originally built for the Stonehenge board game) so i guess the core idea of rolling a thing on a series of rolling things has always been there.<br/><br/>thanks for the encouragement and i look forward to more play and testing in the future!                         </div>

                            Defiance is almost cooked. I'd like to have it on the dinner table for Yuletide.<br/><br/>I'm about a third of the way through a new project that I'm temporarily calling "Against the Shadow" because I'm a big fan of METW CCG (I'll rename it later on). AtS uses traditional playing card.  Its definitely a bronze age fantasy, but I'm not sure to what subgenre it belongs. I guess it high fantasy, but without the massive wide-scale clash between the forces of good and evil. <br/><br/>It's greatly inspired by myths and tales of heroes that founded tribes and nations, those legendary semi-divine figures from which some peoples are said to have descended. Imagine if Abraham had been Conan and it will give you an idea of what I'm trying to achieve (no offense intended towards any Jews)  or think of how Slovenians have a story that the city of Ljubljana was founded by Jason, the hero that won the Golden Fleece.                         </div>

                            I'm working on The D.R.E.A.D. Squad when I get the time and energy. It's basically a Global Frequency rpg that uses a whacked out version of the Jenga Dread rules. I'm really liking where it's headed and I'm stoked about two things in it: it can support a lot of players; and it's got rules for who can talk.<br/><br/>I'd be lying if AW ideas didn't find their way in though.                         </div>

<blockquote>I've been gnawing on <i>Measure of a Badass</i>, my action-movie light mechanics sim game, for about a year now.  Its parent system, OneShot, is three years old.  It's about bringing the black-and-white gonzo action style from the '80s and early '90s into the present day.<br/><br/>We've playtested the damn thing probably two dozen times, and it's tight, but I keep ending up with that persistent fear of there being something missing/wrong, especially as I learn more and more about mechanics and the Fruitful Void (cf. John Harper).  A rewrite is tempting, but we've learned that lesson in my occupational field (software engineering -- anyone remember why we don't use Netscape anymore?  They threw away their entire codebase and rewrote the thing over the course of years, and all the lessons learned along with it, and ended up pushing their release cycle so far back that they lost their market share and never recovered.)</blockquote>
I don't know, when I re-design my games I always end up reusing the stuff I like. I don't see why you couldn't go back to your roots even if you decide to re-write. You don't yet have a market share to lose.                        </div>

<blockquote><br/><b>Caudillo</b>, my GMless game about a dictator and his scheming henchmen needs playtests. A very dear project for me.<br/></blockquote>
Want!  Sign me up. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  For playtesting, I mean.
<blockquote><br/>I'm working on The D.R.E.A.D. Squad when I get the time and energy. It's basically a Global Frequency rpg that uses a whacked out version of the Jenga Dread rules. I'm really liking where it's headed and I'm stoked about two things in it: it can support a lot of players; and it's got rules for who can talk.<br/></blockquote>
Global Frequency!  Yes!<br/><br/>I'm in the early stages of <b>DAISHŌ</b>, a structured three-player game about a grizzled ronin and young pupil/child on the lam, in the vein of Lone Wolf &amp; Cub.  One player plays a "big" character, another player plays a "little" character, and the third player GMs.  Currently, I need to consolidate my GMing notes and then try it out with friends to figure out where the fun is, so to speak.  I've tried to rig the game towards themes of sacrifice, guardianship, and the ninjo/giri conflict common in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai_cinema#Themes" rel="nofollow">chanbara</a>.  What I'm most excited about is using the rules to shift the premise to other settings -- think Road to Perdition, Boba Fett and Jango Fett, or Mireille and Kirika from the anime series NOIR.<br/> </div>

Hell of a point there.  Still tempted to go ahead and public beta what I have, but I certainly won't rule out a distillation if it seems to be what people want.<br/> </div>

                            Actually, that's pretty good! The blue and white theme is very nice, but maybe a little splash of colour on the food, like a bit of red or orange maybe? Two things about the photography: A slightly lower angle would be really nice, even if your reflection shows up in that silver pot because the real key to food photography is a narrow depths of focus. Put the background and sometimes the immediate foreground out of focus and bam! instant professional-looking photo! You've already got the basic down pat, you can totally take it to the next level.                        </div>

I guess I could make a short English version for playtesting. I'd definitely like to see how the game works when I'm not around facilitating it.<br/><br/>In the latest playtest I started out as El Presidente (a random roll decided that), who tried to make our country a quasi-fascist police state. I was deposed by the chief of secret police Dr. Schneider, who was inexplicably supported by the leftist faction of our goverment. These ministers were subsequently killed in Dr. Schneider's anti-marxist purge. I was so proud of my players!                        </div>

<blockquote>Actually, that's pretty good! The blue and white theme is very nice, but (1) maybe a little splash of colour on the food, like a bit of red or orange maybe? Two things about the photography: (2) A slightly lower angle would be really nice, even if your reflection shows up in that silver pot because the real key to food photography is a narrow depths of focus. (3) Put the background and sometimes the immediate foreground out of focus and bam! instant professional-looking photo! You've already got the basic down pat, you can totally take it to the next level.</blockquote>
(1).  You know what?  You're right.  I can see that.  The dish does have more color: kale sprinkled over it to add (a little flavor and) visual variety, but it's too small to show up in this view.  It's probably a situation for those cutesy sprigs of parsley, or some vegetable (red or orange, as you say) carved up and placed on the top or side.<br/><br/>(2).  But are you sure about the lower angle?  Suppose I were using this in a menu: do I really want to give the customer less of a view of the top of the item?<br/><br/>(3).  Focus, regrettably, will have to wait for me to practice more.  My wife is the one who's studied photography; I just ask nicely to use her camera.<br/><br/>(Are derails frowned upon on this forum?)                         </div>

I was thinking like a little salad, or a salsa, or even some caviar on top, but I don't feel confidant about suggesting ingredients or anything because I don't actually know how to cook. I just like food photography and I watch a lot of cooking competition shows.

Hmm, now I'm thinking through various salads I've seen in restaurants.  To me at home, "salad" is something with big leaves, cheese, and possibly other stuff.  That wouldn't look good.  But a more stringy salad, possibly made from kelp or seaweed?  I've been served those, AND they're seafood themed, and they are a nice rich green (also orange, with carrots).  Now I'm hungry, darn it, and I don't have those ingredients.

You know, I would have actually addressed the topic, but the joke got in my way.  And I've already posted my projects in my own thread, anyway.  If needed, I can list:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/370105323051113" rel="nofollow">The Way of the Tiger RPG</a>, a pencil-and-paper roleplaying game derived from the classic gamebook series.

Oh, this sounds like a really nice idea! Third person, I'm sure it's been done in IF quite a lot, but I haven't seen it in game-books. The jump from there to multi-character, it makes me go: "Hey, why didn't I ever think of it?!"                        </div>

Well, thank you.  It was put in practice by Paul Gresty, who . . . hmm, I want to provide a link to his writing, but I don't have a relevant one.  There's some other writing by him in the competition for the <a href="http://www.arborell.com/windhammer_prize.html" rel="nofollow">Windhammer Prize</a> (voting in progress; here's hoping), but that's another variation: it's first person.  He's putting together an extension of the Arcana Agency book (third person) that we can give out as a promo: I'll post a link here when it's all prettied up and you can judge if it really works.<br/><br/>In any case, he's described this difference as not just a mechanical one, but a storytelling one: the story is more "about" the main characters than it would otherwise be.                        </div>

This is an implementation of it.  It's sort of a "demo" or prequel to the main project, and is completely self-contained.
