With my help.<br/><br/>Alice's fiance, Lord Mace, was working on mending his reputation (which merely means his wild parties will have to be a tad more discreet), and folks speculated about a bachelor party (or equivalent) where Alice attended in her male disguise (which Lord Mace knows all about).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Reginald / Gregory told Gregory's brother, the not-in-the-loop-about-the-substitution Archibald, about getting engaged to Sophronia. Archibald asked if their mother knew. And their father. And grandfather. And Aunt Rosemary. Once Reginald confirmed all of this, Archibald announced his brother's engagement.<br/><br/>Sophronia realized with horror that Edwina Campion would have to be invited. After all, the engagement had been announced at her ball.<br/><br/>Sophronia: I thought it was only christenings to which I had to invite everyone. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411359/#Comment_411359" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-05T06:22:06+00:00" title="April  5, 2013  6:22AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran the Golden Sky Stories demo last night (as part of a "they think they're people" doubleheader that started with a game of Animal Crime).

I've played Fiasco once, they have pretty much only played various flavors of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>We had a strongarm corrupt insurance salesman (Clark), a former highschool teacher whose career had been ruined by a teenaged girl (Mary) struggling to come to terms with her inclinations toward her own sex who thought Clark could "fix" her. She (it is now 15 years later) and the local priest (Father Brown) shared so many dark secrets (despite the fact the she was a Lutheran) that it was hard to sort them out. Father Brown, whose predilections ran toward freaky Mexicans (quoting the playset), often spent time at the Windmill Diner out on East Branch Road, owned by his parishioner Bill (who not coincidentally employed several attractive young Mexicans that seemed freaky enough). Bill was, of course, behind on his insurance premiums.<br/><br/>We learned a lot about playing through play (like you do), and were notably more fluent after the Tilt as we drove toward destruction. I really enjoyed facilitating - I was pretty forward about saying "Do we really need to introduce someone/something new? Maybe look at the table first..." and trying to help folks end scenes before the just petered out. I played Mary more gonzo than I would normally be inclined to, so the others wouldn't feel like they were the only ones sticking their necks out. It was a joy watching the other players start to "get" things like the power of reincorporation, the different sorts of freedom inherent in establishing and resolving scenes, and the generosity of including the contributions of others in "their own" stories.<br/><br/>So, the final scene. Poisoned peaches. Ice cream social. Mary betrays both Clark, his wife Beth (who she had REALLY had an affair with 15 years ago), and Father Brown by serving the poisoned peaches to EVERYONE. With ice cream. And sprinkles. (NEED: To get even with the whole county...) As police and ambulance arrive, she is the only one not writhing on the floor. All the characters wind up living, but Father Brown (who had eaten the peaches knowingly, wanting to die) is kicked out of the church and saddled with an increasingly less freaky Rosalita and an ever-expanding brood. Bill comes out with his dignity intact - his tornado-damaged diner is repaired and he is eventually even able to expand and prosper. Clark's wife Beth is in a coma, so he is able to pin the blame for all of his malfeasance on her, which doesn't negate the fact that he's broke and a long-term hospital bed costs even more than her spiteful shopping sprees. Mary goes to jail and when she gets out she comes out, but doesn't get any saner.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412109/#Comment_412109" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-16T23:09:38+00:00" title="April 16, 2013 11:09PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2013 11:13PM by Lisa Padol.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Monday's Kerberos Fate, Sophronia, the 9 inch clockwork faerie, did not get attacked with cold iron, but her player supplied a quote for that eventuality: "You're hitting me with iron? What's the matter with you? How were you RAISED?!"<br/><br/>Reginald explained to Sophronia that, past Gibralter, all things are permissible.<br/><br/>Sophronia: Etiquette changes depending on which side of the river you're on? Really? Alice, why did you not tell me that? Does everyone else have the same problem with water I have?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Alice made it clear that she did not want to become her male alter ego as yet.<br/><br/>Alice: I would have to bring back Alec. Alec has been hiding.<br/><br/>Sophronia: I'm sure London misses him terribly.<br/><br/>Reginald took a deep breath and risked asking Sophronia, his fiance, why fae magic was keeping anyone from finding her "cousin", the 20 foot tall mechanical man, Talos, who was probably working for / with the Chartists (who might have nefarious schemes if I can ever come up with appropriate ones). The group remembered that the Chartists had a fae working for / with them.<br/><br/>Sophronia: Yes, and we through him into an iron fence.<br/><br/>Reginald: But we made that up to him.<br/><br/>Sophronia: So he might not hate us now.<br/><br/>Reginald: What is Talos getting up to?<br/><br/>Sophronia: His own business, I'm sure. He plays a lot of chess.<br/><br/>Victor: Would you protect Talos if he hurt someone?<br/><br/>Sophronia: I don't think he has.<br/><br/>Victor (after a few more rounds of continuing to fail to get Sophronia to give a more definite answer to the question) Are you being deliberately evasive or are you really that stupid?<br/><br/>Sophronia: That doesn't seem a very nice question. Aren't you supposed to be polishing your manners?<br/><br/>She did point out that Victor might be able to play chess with Talos by letter, something Victor clearly wanted to do.<br/><br/>Victor: Where do I deliver a letter to take it to Talos?<br/><br/>Sophronia: Well, I could take it to him.<br/><br/>Victor gave her a paper he already had on him, with a chess move already written down.<br/><br/>Reginald asked if he could give Sophronia a letter for Talos, and she agreed.<br/><br/>Sophronia: Last call for the Official Talos Post.<br/><br/>Alice: I don't see a particular reason to give him a letter. I'll send him my card.<br/><br/>GM: Talos is getting mail. Why does that seem so much more surreal than anything else?<br/><br/>Reginald (to Sophronia) It occurs to me that when your relatives get themselves in debt to faeries, bad things happen and trips to Mars need to be taken.<br/><br/>Victor remains (properly) suspicious of Talos. After all, why is Talos unwilling to meet him?<br/><br/>Reginald: We do have a reputation.<br/><br/>Sophronia: For, you know, knocking things over and setting things on fire.<br/><br/>Victor: All those things deserved it!<br/><br/>Sophronia: But you understand, from an outside perspective, that might not be immediately obvious.<br/><br/>Then, the group went off to Shelborough to attend a wedding, as I borrowed the prologue scenario from Chaosium's Terror from the Skies.

Going by the book, the answer would be no, but I wasn't asking the book.<br/><br/>GM: Do we want a tree monster?<br/><br/>Player: Yes!!<br/><br/>GM (checking the clock)L Might I suggest we wait until next session for the tree monster battle?<br/><br/>Folks agreed, and suggested that the tree monsters would have to be stopped without the bride and groom noticing there was a problem.<br/><br/>Sophronia: Because they have to be HAPPY! Are you happy when tree monsters attack?<br/><br/>Alice: We are.<br/><br/>Sophronia: We're special.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412112/#Comment_412112" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-17T04:36:30+00:00" title="April 17, 2013  4:36AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dungeon Planet:<br/><br/>One moment Captain Van Buskirk is leading a mounted charge against Villista bandits, and the next he's fighting for his life against four-armed apes in an exploding methane cavern on a moon of Saturn!<br/><br/>A short time later he's fallen in love with Princess Narissa, the haughty daughter of the Solar Emperor, been drugged by agents of an unstoppable robot army, and rescued by his new best friend, a taciturn mechanical man named M-7.<br/><br/>I think my favorite bit of business is the fact that M-7 doesn't understand the relationship between Van Buskirk and his cavalry horse, Top Hat.

Wouldn't you know it, I went to a comic shop owned by this guy that I'm totally gonna have do my ink when I'm ready, and I found a group to Mouse Guard it up!<br/><br/>After a really epic race, this cool lady became a big fan of mine and did the sketch for the tat, but when I went to get it done, I realized that Vin Diesel already has super awesome work on his arms, and I really couldn't do it half as good as him, so I decided to get a septum piercing instead, one day.<br/><br/>I was inside the fence of my parole officer's house trying to sneak up and surprise her, but her dogs totally went psycho on me and she handcuffed me, and not in that good way.  I mean, she still seems cool and all, so maybe I'll invite her to our Mouse Guard table and see what's what.  (It's totally the super sweet hood of a Camaro that we used Killz on and dry erase markers and sh*t.)<br/><br/>When I went back to the shop to get my piercing, I thought taking my lady fan with me was a hot idea, but when the dude told me I wasn't Cool enough, she took his side!  What the f***!  So I escalated that shituation by drawin my piece, but he must have had some kind of combat training or whatever, 'cause he busted me real good and threw me out of the store.<br/><br/>The Lugeing is going great though.

I'd never run Dungeon World (or AW) before, so I felt a little shaky as a GM, but last night's game was good. We ended up with the characters split, but all of them were aboard a Martian pirate warship named "Heaven," which is captained by a 8-foot-tall reptilian man called "the Dragon." (Rumors that he is actually a dragon have not been verified, but likely will in the next session.) Two characters were at the Dragon's feet, while our Earthling, Jack von Buskirk, was barracked with a bunch of weirdo pirates playing knife games.<br/><br/>Next session will be the first real all-dungeon, all-the-time session as the characters do something inside the ship. Ships make great dungeons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413274/#Comment_413274" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-01T09:56:17+00:00" title="May  1, 2013  9:56AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Clinton">@Clinton</a> if ships make great dungeons we're going to take this dungeon over and fly it to Earth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413284/#Comment_413284" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-01T10:47:04+00:00" title="May  1, 2013 10:47AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played my first game of Until We Sink last night. Fun stuff. Ended up being very Lovecraftian with monsters from the sea feeding on the brains of people on the island, a phenomenon going back many years. The hotel's Caretaker was the monsters' lackey, but the Eternal Backpacker was secretly sent to ensure the Caretaker was doing his job and keeping the secrets (he wasn't). The Backpacker ended up being impregnated by the Alcoholic Writer and the Sun Worshipper, and everyone got devoured in the end.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413295/#Comment_413295" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-01T12:54:20+00:00" title="May  1, 2013 12:54PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love Until We Sink!
