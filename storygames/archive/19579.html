Less than a month to Concrete Cow 14\xbd, so time for me to start up the publicity machine.<br/><br/>The lunchtime curry is now confirmed as being the same menu and price as last time (poppadums; starter; chicken, lamb, and vegetable dishes; naan; rice) for \xa311.00 plus drinks. <br/><br/>We're also looking for prizes for the charity raffle. If you have something you'd like to offer, or think you could twist someone else's arm, please let me know. <a href="http://squarehex.myshopify.com/" rel="nofollow">SquareHex</a> have generously offered at \xa320 voucher and a Box of Tricks (a wooden box filled with various small notepads).<br/><br/>And finally, we need more games! If you're thinking of offering a game for Concrete Cow, please let us know and we'll add it to the <a href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow_games" rel="nofollow">Concrete Cow games page</a>. So far, we have the one game from James Mullen:<br/><br/><b>Blood &amp; Water</b><br/>The storygame of Being Human: players create a set of supernatural housemates and their residence within the first hour of play, then explore the consequences of their choices in the remaining time.<br/><br/><i>Plymouth</i><br/>The year is 1650 and the place is Plymouth, Massachusetts: the pilgrims have settled in this new world for the past 30 years, but amongst them are some who have their own private reasons for wanting to leave the civilised world behind them. The monsters trying to live quietly within the community are finding that this New World has a lore &amp; supernature of it's own and they might be best placed to deal with it if they want the colony to survive.<br/><br/>Think Being Human crossed with The Scarlet Letter and maybe a touch of Sleepy Hollow: because superstition is such a part of life, NPCs are more likely to believe that the supernatural can occur and less likely to dismiss the idea of ghosts, vampires, etc. I'm thinking a confrontation between the monsters of Europe and the monsters of North America might be interesting and yes, as it's New England, the Cthulhu Mythos is allowed too.\n<ul><li>GM: James Mullen<br/></li><li>Players: 3 or 4<br/></li>Slot: Morning</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438036/#Comment_438036" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-01T14:27:15+00:00" title="September  1, 2014  2:27PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2014 2:29PM by Neil.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Less than two weeks to go to Concrete Cow and the <a href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow_games" rel="nofollow">games list</a> is filling up.
