From my recollection it is a name for that practice in games where the GM gives the option of a choice but the outcome is the same, regardless of the decision made - thus it not being a real choice, just an illusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nie. You are travelling from A to C. You come to a fork in the road. You know that one way, you will encounter B and then onto C. Another you will go straight to C. The GM knows that 'right' will lead you direct to C. You choose 'right'. Suddenly, 'left' takes you direct to C and lo and behold, you encounter B. The GM was always going to have you encounter B. The choice was an illusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least, thats what I believe it means.

But the notion that some degree of meaningful choice is taken away, or re-allocated, or whatever, and handed to one player isn't necessarily an evil thing.  Many, many games work this way and it's no big deal.  If you play 3:16 you don't get a meaningful choice about where you will go or what you will fight, and that's right up front.  D&amp;D4 is organized into encounters.  The place where collaboration and choice occur is somewhere other than the encounter conveyor belt.

Like most techniques, it can be used well and it can also be over- or abused. <br/><br/>Now, personally I've grown really tired of it, both as a player (I wanna do stuff, dammit!!!) and as a GM (That shit is hard work, man!!!) so it's something I try to avoid in my gaming ATM. Not really because it's based on deceit (Although that has something to do with it.), but mostly because I've had it up to here with "The GMs story" and want to actually, you know, influence things in a way that goes beyond fake choices. (Maybe the GMs I know justs uck at illusionism... ^_^)<br/><br/>But yeah, if the ride has a nice view and the destination is awesometown, illusionism can be pretty fun, too.

There are many choices, and those choices don't all need to be dealt with the same way.  And yet, someone has to make those choices.  Obviously, on one end of the spectrum, you have all decisions made by one person's fiat -- that's a single storyteller.  On the other end, you have all choices made by the participants -- that's GM-less, or something.  So, no, fiat is not an orthogonal issue; it's about who really makes the choices, which is exactly the issue at the crux of illusionism et al.<br/><br/>And on the point of which decisions are the ones people fuss about making themselves, Mark W nails it.  Thanks for the correction.<br/><br/>ETA: Kevin, I think that's participationism -- it's agreed ahead of time (by virtue of playing with those rules) that the GM can decide to make the decision themselves if they so choose.  There's no illusion, because the participants know that going in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174008/#Comment_174008" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T21:45:58+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  9:45PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniel Yokomizo</cite><a href="http://ptgptb.org/0027/theory101-02.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is another good article explaining illusionism and other styles.</blockquote>\nMan, you beat me to it...

Either the players have the freedom to make meaningful choices at all points, or they never have any. Often, though, I see illusionism as a very situational technique, that gets deployed briefly in the middle of non-illusionist play.<br/><br/>For example, players are in a non-illusionist but GM-ful game. They have ended up through their own choices in some location (e.g. a dungeon style area), where the GM has prepared a few interesting things that they may or may not discover while exploring, but not drawn a map. Often the GM will present details of directional choices, for fiction verisimilitude, that actually don't matter. Basically there may be many routes, paths, corridors and the like, but there are only a few interesting things to find, so the GM will move those things to wherever the players go, because otherwise the experience will be deadly boring. Now that is illusionism, but it's not large scale, it's just a brief dabble.<br/><br/>I've done that myself. I find that the players want detail of a location way beyond what I have prepared, because they want to explore, (e.g. they ask about every turn, or doorway, or mark on the wall ... when I wasn't expecting them too), but they also want to find something interesting. They do not, despite their wish for detail, really want to spend an hour looking at dead ends. Now I could tell them "You can can explore all you like, but there are only two interesting rooms to find" but that horribly breaks the mood, even if it is participationism, I find it better to use a touch of illusionism and just have them find the interesting room wherever it was they went.<br/><br/>Now you could argue that's not meaningful choice, and therefore not actually illusionism, but I think by paying a lot of attention to making the choice the players make it meaningful, even if it shouldn't be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174039/#Comment_174039" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T06:15:45+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  6:15AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2008 6:15AM by Mark W.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hituro, is that <b>illusionism</b>, or is that <b>scene framing</b>?

There are many choices, and those choices don't all need to be dealt with the same way.  And yet, someone has to make those choices.  Obviously, on one end of the spectrum, you have all decisions made by one person's fiat -- that's a single storyteller.  On the other end, you have all choices made by the participants -- that's GM-less, or something.  So, no, fiat is not an orthogonal issue; it's about who really makes the choices, which is exactly the issue at the crux of illusionism et al.</blockquote>\nI was trying to point out that choice is always presented (e.g. "What are you doing?", "What do you want to do?"), but in illusionism the future is predetermined (minus color). We can separate in fiction-affecting decisions (in illusionism only the GM can make those) and color-affecting decisions. What was I trying to say when I said "fiat is an orthogonal issue" is that fiat is a possibility in styles other than illusionism (but my wording was awful). I think we're agreeing more than disagreeing, it seems that our problem was with wording not with concepts.<br/><br/>IMO the real issue with illusionism WRT fiat is the way fiat is invisible: players think they affect the world and there's no fiat, but there's fiat everywhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174220/#Comment_174220" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T18:03:28+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  6:03PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lord Minx</cite>Weeeeeell, I wouldn't say that illusionism is inherently bad</blockquote>\nI would.

It's about the existence of the "black curtain".<br/><br/>Quoting the glossary:<br/><br/>"Participationism :     The Technique of using Force without the Black Curtain. Term coined by Mike Holmes."<br/><br/>"Illusionism:  A family of Techniques in which a GM, usually in the interests of story creation, story creation, exerts Force over player-character decisions, in which he or she has authority over resolution-outcomes, and in which the players do not necessarily recognize these features. See Illusionism: a new look and a new approach and Illusionism and GNS. Term coined by Paul Elliott."<br/><br/>If the players KNOW that the GM is using illusionism, but he doesn't acknowledge this and still hid these techniques behind a "black curtain", and everybody act during the game as if nobody know about the "deception".. it's not a real deception, it's still illusionism (and, in my opinion, the only functional kind of illusionism)<br/><br/>It become partecipationism only when nobody care to keep the curtain anymore and people at the table talk openly about these things.<br/><br/>Both are "railroading" only if they violate the social contract of the group.<br/><br/>"Railroading - Control of a player-character's decisions, or opportunities for decisions, by another person (not the player of the character) in any way which breaks the Social Contract for that group, in the eyes of the character's player. The term describes an interpretation of a social and creative outcome rather than any specific Technique."<br/><br/>(I have some problem with this definition of railroading, by the way: as written, if a player has his/her control over the character's choices taken from him by the GM, and hate it, but still accept it as the kind of social contract he has to endure to be able to play and think that this is "right", he is not suffering under railroading.

In this case the GM spots that you've lost the trail, aren't going to get it back any time soon, *want* to get it back, and then moves the trail to wherever it is you happen to be going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174289/#Comment_174289" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T08:38:13+00:00" title="October  9, 2008  8:38AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kevin.weiser</cite>So Choice is Presented + Player opts to use a power + DM Awards Hero Point to make choice irrelevant = Illusory participationism?</blockquote>Just regular ol' participationism with a bribe to encourage acceptance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser" title="kevin.weiser"><img alt="kevin.weiser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.finitesite.com/spiderlegs/wlkngI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser">kevin.weiser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174334/#Comment_174334" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T11:25:57+00:00" title="October  9, 2008 11:25AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2008 11:26AM by kevin.weiser.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Kevin, have you gotten what you want out of this thread?</blockquote>\nQuite! And on that note, I find the moralizing fascinating. As one who is recently coming over to the hippy side of things, I find the temptation to moralize very strong. It's simply a side effect of being passionate about something: the stronger your feelings on a subject, the more likely you are to see aspects of that subject in moral terms. As they say "all anger is righteous anger".  Besides, the definition of illusionism was fairly straightfoward, the real conversation lies in how we handle it at the table and whether it's healthy.<br/><br/>To that end, I posit that Illusionism is not inherently bad, as it can save a flagging story and re-energize the table, but it's a technique that only has a few rare uses and lends itself to abuse far too easily. It must be used sparingly, cleverly, and with great caution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174378/#Comment_174378" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T14:39:40+00:00" title="October  9, 2008  2:39PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Moreno,<br/><br/>That's an interesting comment!

But you do create illusions when you're the GM, some of them not inherently bad.<br/><br/>I didn't think that was the case in games like Primetime Adventures or In A Wicked Age, but, in fact, you still do. Not as intensely as in an old-style table top game (like FUDGE, say, which is pretty much written with a positive slant on using illusions to influence the outcome of the story. It encourages you to do so, in fact, with a few good reasons behind it.) But there is still a modicum of social maniupulation neccessary in these more story-oriented games and illusion is one of the tools in that toolbox.<br/><br/>For instance, let's say you've got a player who's having trouble grasping what it means to set stakes. The player is enthusiastic and likeable and perhaps even an intregal part of the roleplaying group. But this persons' thinking style is far more concrete than abstract, making it difficult to grasp the idea that stakes are not always about accomplishing a task so much as facing a possible change to your character or the direction and mood of the story.<br/><br/>How do you help this player, who may have a bit of an ego after being popular and important to the group for so long, grasp the idea without chiding or belittling? Well, the toolbox of techniques you've built up as a GM will probably have some illusion tricks for making players feel better about their decisions. These can be useful.<br/><br/>Here's an old illusion technique, for instance: acting like the players threw you for a loop when they've spent some time coming up with a scheme.<br/>This works particularly well with what Robin Laws calls "tactical" players. It helps them feel like they've outsmarted me, even if they're walking into a pre-planned scene.<br/><br/>Another one is warning people that you're not a great GM, but that you like doing it. It doesn't matter if you're a good GM or not, really, in most of the new crop of story games. (Well, things with a lot of player input like With Great Power... or Polaris ...or PtA, of course.) But if you make a mistake and the players already know you're not a good GM, you're covered. If you do a great job, you're gonna get a positive response anyway. And it helps players new to story games concepts accept them a little more, especially when they feel like they're discovering them despite your relative but well-meaning incompetence.<br/><br/>People spend a great deal of their time in any social relationship wearing something of a mask anyway, accepting and handing out roles the group needs fulfilled and which you seem like you might be able to handle. <br/><br/>I think where a lot of illusion techniques goes wrong is that there's a tendancy to become hubristic. When you can trick another person, you feel like you've got power over that person or a sense of mental superiority. Perhaps tinting your illusions with a sense of humility or self-effacing humor might take some of the curse off it. Or perhaps it makes you look like a whining loser. I can only hope the outcome is at least a little positive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174569/#Comment_174569" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-11T09:03:31+00:00" title="October 11, 2008  9:03AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Arpie, you are mistaking social manipulation techniques with illusionism techniques. None of the techniques you describe is illusionistic: you are pushing the player to do the choice you want, while illusionism is about making him choose what he want and then discard his choice as meaningless, without telling him.<br/><br/>Illusionism: the player must choose between doom 1 or 2. The GM know the choice is meaningless, in both cases he will find the same room<br/>Social manipulation: the player must choose between door 1 and 2, and the GM describe them in a way that would paint he character as a coward if he didn't choose the first one he meet (door 1).  In a narrativist game is a very bad way to GM but it isn't a deception.<br/><br/>Another thing: in you PTA example, it's the player that is playing by-the-book: stakes HAVE to be about some concrete objective of the character, from the characters point of view, in PTA-by-the-book (it's a very common drift to see stakes from the player's point-of-view, so in PTA-as-is-often-played your version would be all right, but the players isn't having "trouble": he is understanding the concept of stakes very well, and he is playing by-the-book)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174571/#Comment_174571" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-11T09:08:48+00:00" title="October 11, 2008  9:08AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2008 9:12AM by Arpie.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're kidding me.<br/>Man, that is SO frustrating.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed playing PtA the wrong way.

I made the players think they had choices, when really they didn't. No matter what they did, the outcome would still be the same. <br/><br/>Everyone loved the game. <br/><br/>Years later we're talking about the game, and I say, "Yea, well, it was illusionist, so..." <br/><br/>One player says, "What do you mean? We totally decided that we were going to go kill Zoran, you didn't decide that, right?" <br/><br/>And I'm like "Well, if you didn't go kill Zoran he was going to blow up the world, and given that we were playing with an assumed heroic dynamic, your acceptable range of choice at that point was pretty much nill." (Yes, I actually talk like that.) <br/><br/>And that player goes "Oh... huh. I don't think I like that." <br/><br/>Then the next player goes, "So no matter what I said to Cede, he would still have fallen in love with me?" <br/><br/>And I'm like "Well, no. That was a subplot, I didn't really care what happened there so I just played the character as he was written." <br/><br/>And that player goes "Well then I don't care, the whole killing Zoran thing was fun, but the point of the game to me was the relationship with Cede." <br/><br/>And I go, "Oh... huh." <br/><br/>And then the third player goes, "I got to blow shit up, so I don't really care." <br/><br/>Then we went and played another game, and we all said, "So, if we're at a point where something has to happen, we just say it has to happen. If not, then the players really should decide what happens." And everyone said "Okay." <br/><br/>And of course it didn't turn out to be that simple in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174969/#Comment_174969" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-14T14:51:32+00:00" title="October 14, 2008  2:51PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite><br/>And of course it didn't turn out to be that simple in play.</blockquote>\nSo, what happened?
