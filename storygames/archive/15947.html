"Surviving The Con" is data I'm always willing to hear with the most open of ears.</blockquote>\nPaul T. (who is a super cool person and friend) from this thread taught me the breathing exercises I now use to help combat GMing fallout! <br/><br/>Todd Furler, at Gen Con, kept sucking on lollipops. I asked why and it was to keep his throat moist. I don't love lollipops and have been trying an assortment of throat lozenges. I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ricola-Throat-Drops-Lemon-Sugar/dp/B000P5239Q/" rel="nofollow">sugar free</a> lozenges. I keep a bowl on the table for myself and any co-GMs (like when we played Elmer Sapp).<br/><br/>Terry taught me that to keep my energy level high... do subtle exercise throughout the day, walk up stairs instead of taking the elevator, stand up while GMing, walk everywhere I can, keep my spine straight, offer to carry people's bags, and hit the gym first thing in the morning. <br/><br/>My body has taught me to get lots of sleep by kicking my butt when I don't. There was a large group at Dreamation that partied Saturday night till 4am, then went to a diner, and still managed to wake up by 10am to game! I was jealous but at the same time I know my individual limitations. In general I now bring ear plus and an eye mask to ensure I can sleep solidly even when we share hotel rooms where people come in and out of the room at random times during the night. <br/><br/>People I've met who do voice acting insist that room temperature water and apples keep your voice solid through 8 hours of almost non-stop talking. They also like tea with lemon and honey instead of coffee. <br/><br/>My sister who is a pharmacist advised I take vitamin C powders (not vitamin pills) every morning at a convention to avoid getting sick. <br/><br/>Generally I do my best to listen to people, watch what they do, and then experiment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362859/#Comment_362859" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T05:46:33+00:00" title="February 27, 2012  5:46AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2012 5:47AM by jenskot.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Plus, after you're rested, hit us up with the list of Games, Systems, and what you mean by Audience Members!</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I can't wait to hear your stories.

In several cases, the alternates decided to sit down and watch most of the game. We had 1 player sit at the table with us, for 4 hours, to watch one of the most intense Dogs games I've ever run (at least in the top 10). <br/><br/>In the Dreamation Marvel game we also had 3-4 audience members... some of which I deputized as co-GMs. The rule was you can watch but I might tag you in.

Like: say we go to an oil refinery.  Can the player just say, "I'm blowing up this oil tank!" without having to spend plot points to create the oil tank, and then create some conflagration?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I ask is that incorporating that kind of environmental, fictional stuff on an as-needed basis (clouds to dice, in Vincent's terminology) is one of the things I really like about role-playing.  Having everything exist as part of a delicate economy is a really cool accomplishment, but not what I want on a regular basis...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362963/#Comment_362963" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T12:01:59+00:00" title="February 27, 2012 12:01PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James, forgive me if I mess up some bits of the game, I just read it over this weekend.<br><br>The Watcher can set distinctions (right? is that what they are called?) when they set the scene, so when setting the scene for the oil tanker, they could put them on the table (maybe via post-it notes) to be used by hero or villain.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362983/#Comment_362983" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T12:24:58+00:00" title="February 27, 2012 12:24PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Odds are good that the Watcher would set up the action scene with the oil tanks as a scene distinction (or, uh, asset?) that the PCs could then use to Michael Bay the heck out of stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
