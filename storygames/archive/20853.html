I do mean to say that, in my opinion, a lot of work went into AW to make sure that the various mechanics mesh together, gear-like, to give rise to a cinematic experience in which authorial power/protagonism is shared among players in a particular way (emphasizing giving them information and fictional potency, so that they are put in a position to make hard choices, and have their choices matter), and that other games often don't have those gears mesh with the same precision. <br/><br/>That's often okay: it's why gears have tolerances in real life. How tightly you need the rules to mesh depends on what you're running.<br/><br/>I generally hesitate to criticize PbtA games, because I feel like a large fraction of their authorship can be found around here. I may very well find them flawed to a greater or lesser degree, but writing games and game engines is /hard/, and in this sort of context I feel less like I'm offering constructive criticism and more like I'm pissing on someone's hard work. I prefer a little more distance between my critiques and the author's ears, yanno?<br/><br/>But, I am willing to give one example, because it may be totally wrong (!) and therefore I feel more comfortable that the author may simply shrug it off.<br/><br/>So, take a look at the City of Mist Starter. They chose to use a core PbtA mechanical base, because, as the author says, "FATE dice rolls felt bland" (I paraphrase slightly). It was originally meant to be a FATE game. Now, let's look at some core things that make PbtA work, and some mechanical bits of CoM. <b>Caveat</b>: it's just a starter set, for an as yet incomplete game, whose full text I haven't seen. I can be <i>wildly off!</i> So this is half-baked criticism of half-baked material:<br/><br/>The core PbtA mechanic has a three-track outcome system: <br/>(1) got what you want, how you wanted it<br/>(2) got what you want, but not the way you wanted it (complication arises - what do you do about it?)<br/>(3) didn't get what you want, and definitely not the way you wanted it (complication arises - what do you do about it?)<br/><br/>The point of the mechanic is the core gameplay loop: "players make choices. choices have consequences. players make choices about dealing with those consequences. New consequences!" Choice -&gt; Consequence -&gt; Choice is the core, snowballing, engine of PbtA. That's why players need to know what the general consequence of their choice is, and why the players are narratively empowered - their choice has to actually make an impact on how things play out. The key isn't "here's a die roll for great/okay/shit." It's a die roll to enforce the Choice-&gt;Consequence-&gt;Choice loop. <br/><br/>PbtA games generally have a philosophical/mechanical bar on removing player choices. Thus, when you see Mind Control mechanics, they're generally implemented as something like "Mark 1 XP if you do what you're told and/or take -1 ongoing if you're acting in direct opposition to orders." You're basically incentivizing people to incorporate the "mind control" into the core gameplay loop of Choice-&gt;Consequence-&gt; Choice. I kill that loop if I take choice out of your hands.<br/><br/>So let's see a couple of the core mechanics from CoM. These mechanics are meant to enforce the core themes of exploring your mythic/mortal identities, and trying to balance them by not going against or ignoring them:<br/><br/>In City of Mist, you're the physical embodiment of legend, and it's supposed to be very difficult for you to act "against" your legend. It has the <b>Make A Hard Choice</b> move, which includes the text "On 7-9, this aspect of you somehow deteriorates. Choose a new weakness tag. If you fail, your character is unable to muster the willpower to act against this aspect of herself and the MC makes a move as usual." <br/><br/>So, first, this dice roll isn't "here are consequences for your difficult choice," it's "roll to see if you're /allowed/ to make this choice." On a 6- it's not that you made a valiant effort and you didn't achieve your aims, now deal with consequences. It's "nothing happened; your character didn't really want to try after all." That's not just narratively boring, it undermines the core Choice loop of the engine. <br/><br/>A 7-9 isn't much better: "You gain a new weakness tag." It's not a fictional complication that requires the player to the answer the question "What do you do?". It's a mechanical penalty. Literally, 2/3 of the outcomes for a mechanic embodying the game's central tension are *fictionally irrelevant* for the players: in one, nothing happens. In the other, you did what you wanted, and your character gets a bit weaker. It's not actually a fictional complication. It doesn't snowball the plot.<br/><br/>Another example is <b>Stop. Holding. Back.</b> In this move, a player attempts to " try to use your abilities in a way or scale you've never attempted before". <br/><br/>So how does Stop. Holding. Back. work? "The MC will choose one stake and write it on a piece of paper, <b>out of sight</b>. Then, roll+logos. On a 7-9, you do it and pay the price. On +10, you can take a look at the stakes the MC wrote and then choose - do it and pay the price or hold back. On a miss, you lose control over your powers - the MC will say how." And the consequences are things like "you burn out your tags" (resource drain that recovers with downtime), "you're acting in contravention of your identity" (you take a resource hit), "you take a status" (debility, or not - but probably, since all the other choices here are negative), "you lose your theme" (you lose one-fourth of your superpowers, and have to replace them). <br/><br/>On a 10+, you actually get the transparency to make a hard choice. You didn't "get what you want, how you want," you "get what you want, or avoid a bad consequence," which is traditionally a 7-9 in PbtA. The 10+ here isn't "what you want, how you want," it's "now the MC gives you the transparency to make a choice." "What do you do?" doesn't really follow, because most of these outcomes don't have a direct fictional consequence, either (e.g., you mark a crack, or it burns you out). <br/><br/>The 7-9 doubly undermines the core mechanic: there's no direct fictional consequence to respond to /and/ you're not given the transparency to make a meaningful choice. ("Lose a Theme" is the best one: roll a core gameplay mechanic, and risk *unknowingly* losing a significant portion of your character's abilities/customization). Can you imagine something more divorced from the PbtA, "So, I think what you're describing is X. Is X what you're trying to do? If you do X, the drifters are definitely going to turn hostile." "No, I actually meant to do Y." "Oh!" That is, making sure the player choice is clear, establishing a general sense of consequences, etc. than making sure the player doesn't know what choice they're making, what the consequences will be, etc.<br/><br/>It has the *appearance* of the PbtA mechanic, but in cargo cult fashion. It doesn't actually produce the core gameplay loop of PbtA. You're not really choosing a fictional course of action, you're just choosing a mechanical one, and you're not really dealing with consequences. You're just rolling 2d6 and getting 1 of 3 outcomes. <br/><br/>That's just two moves, but since they're the moves central to the game's thematic focus, I thought that would be a good place to look. Fundamentally, the game *looks* PbtA-ish, but it's actual core mechanics completely forego the fiction&lt;-&gt;mechanical interaction that makes PbtA work for driving consequential plot-heavy play.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457754/#Comment_457754" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-01T12:27:02+00:00" title="November  1, 2016 12:27PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I personally find Monsterhearts to be even better that vanilla AW.

Usually, when I'm MCing, I roll dice for the harm move myself instead of having the player do it - which introduces a different kind of anomaly but one that is, IMO, not as confusing.<br/>Either way - rolling myself or having them roll - I used to have a dedicated pair of dice, very obviously distinguished, for the harm move only.

(I've seen lots of PbtA games which don't give as clear a rationale for the way the system works, but AW's apocalyptic nightmare and lack of status quos really mesh nicely with the way the conversation flows, which is sometimes lacking in other hacks.)<br/><br/><i>(Jason, I agree with you about AW's harm... but I have no idea why or how you think Monsterhearts fixes that issue! Is it just the game doesn't have a 'harm move'? Lots of people played AW - and continue to - without engaging the harm move...)</i></blockquote>\nReally, I'm just trying to learn the nuts and bolts of the system. Certain aspects of the system, which have been highly-modified, have inspired my RPG like the roll mechanic without turns &amp; the MCs best practices. Right now a highly-modified version of Situation Aspects from fate core are dealing with issues such as Leverage, Trust/Distrust, and Relationships; if you happen to remember that stuff. Anyway, I just want to see if there are any fertile ideas like Tags or Strings that may improve the approach. I haven't really read much about those mechanics, and although they don't look very promising for my particular needs, one never knows what useful information they may bring <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Thank you for your suggestions <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>P.S Are you still planning on sending me some stuff?

I will check them all out in do time.<br/><br/>P.S. This is a kind of long aside but I thought I would try to adress a few things. Thanks for sending the other kind LB hack; what I have read of it so far seems very interesting. I think it was you who was asking for synopsis of different fantasy situations you could run; I think it would be super cool if you published a book of ready made characters, keys, and adventures that ran your game and hit those adventures that folks had listed. I think it would turn out really well and I would definitely buy it. Are you following what I'm saying and do you think it is a good idea you would like to explore?
