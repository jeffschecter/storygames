So the early birds got the first pass before my sheet was even up.  (I really hate sign up sheets.)<br/><br/>Secondly I filled out my sheet by hand on the day which looked much less professional than the others which had been printed, some in full colour even.<br/><br/>Thirdly I might have chosen systems that don't have a high social currency value.  I was going to run Burning Wheel and the relatively new unknown, Project Ninja Panda Taco.<br/><br/>I am also a relative newcomer to the con scene.  I don't have that reputation yet.  But I was frustrated that I was being denied the opportunity to grow it by not having it in the first place.  I've expanded my online presence and joined this forum this year as I realised that the communities overlap quite significantly and all focus on their own specific aspects game that I wasn't getting sensible conversations about elsewhere.<br/><br/>So areas to improve...  arrive before the doors open, bring a sign up sheet that looks nice, choose a game with a higher darling rating and market myself with posts on forums and tie the online identity to my real self...  I need an avatar...  And lastly find some way to let go of the ranting imp that gets me when it doesn't work out.<br/><br/>How do you get your convention games going?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409078/#Comment_409078" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-15T07:26:37+00:00" title="March 15, 2013  7:26AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like people tend to sign up for popular systems and popular names.

Instead, I am calling it "Trouble in Trollkeep" and my brief write-up says something like "A handful of young adventurers must keep the March of Trollkeep running after the loss of their recently-deceased mother, the Marchioness, and in the absence of their older brother, the apparent heir.

I think only Dragonmeet and Continuum have them and they are very limited in both.<br/><br/>Knowing your Con is a big start. Some games will fill at some Cons and not at others. <br/><br/>I always try and do a pretty sign up sheet to grab attention and because it gives me time to make sure the written 'pitch' is what I want to say. I ramble at the best of times, give me a blank sign up sheet to write my pitch on and who knows what you'll get.<br/><br/>As I was at that Con I know that the game choice was very strong, incredibly varied and the player base quite small. My morning game was really touch and go for players until the last minute and choosing what I wanted to play in the other two slots saw me with an embarrassment of riches. If anything there were too many 'Indie' games up as I know more 'Trad' players ended up in games that pushed their comfort zone in some slots. It really was bad luck that both of your games failed to attract the players. <br/><br/>As a 'knowing the Con' thing I would have thought the afternoon slot would definitely have filled, the evening slot tends to be quieter and people are more likely to go for known GM's/Games in it so you're better risking in slot 1 and 2 rather than 2 and 3 there as I think the last slot is where the 'Names' matter. An unknown GM and an unknown game can be an issue, or possibly a game people think they know and don't like. But equally I'd think hard before running something 'because it's popular' rather than 'because you want to run it.'<br/><br/>At that particular Con I'd also say turning up right at the start with sheets ready is a good move. All the games for the day are put out together and there's not a lot of swapping around between games done so timing does help. The worst times I've had there as a player have been when I've turned up just before slot 1 starts rather than just before doors open and I, at least, think the two things are linked. I'm not sure if they will do filling sheets for you to put out. Some Cons will...<br/><br/>As well as advertising that your game is going to be there and what it is about (especially for an odd game which is why I pushed Ribbon Drive so hard before the Con) ask around about what it's like to run there. The conversation might not help but can at least prime you for what to expect and best methods for that particular Con.<br/><br/>When your game can't run, try and get in to something else and have fun at it. But sometimes it's not an option, I had 1 Con last year where my game had 1 sign up and there was only 1 space in the rest of the games running so I let the sign up have that (after all they'd believed in my game and signed for it, if one of us was going to miss out on playing in that slot it wasn't going to be them) and sloped off to my room to play computer games and feel sorry for myself. If that's what you do in that situation, it's hard not to do it, but it's almost definitely not justified.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409094/#Comment_409094" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-15T08:36:08+00:00" title="March 15, 2013  8:36AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The UK has a number of smaller Cons that run once or twice a year. They get 50-80 players at them and are often 1 or 2 day events as far as the gaming goes. Most don't do booklets as they are run on a very tight (and low) budget. <br/>They do often publicise the games that are being run on web sites for the event though.<br/><br/>It means that games not running is a bit more of an issue because the 'customer base' is smaller and so the number of people who are going to be hooked by something out of the ordinary is fewer. Having said that they also feel like they have a bigger percentage of players willing to try games outside of what might be considered the mainstream. The size does mean that if you get unlucky with what people are running the pool can get emptied fast though, in this instance it's possible that a game of Mouseguard took a big chunk of the Burning Wheel friendly players with some shiny new stuff taking the rest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409095/#Comment_409095" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-15T08:38:47+00:00" title="March 15, 2013  8:38AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>I've never been to a convention that does panels.

At some point I'll get to a gaming Con in the States and be able to say for sure. I've only been to Freeforming/LARPing/Interactive Literature ones so far (2 or 3 lettered Intercons) and they are different again. We're definitely talking Gaming Cons here, from what I can tell all that happens at the Comic/SF/Anime ones in the UK is panels, signings and socialising. Even board gaming is rare and rpgs are non-existent.

Knowing the Con well is a big deal. If you haven't been to it before, it's hard to know how things tend to play out. Plus, if you don't come to the Con knowing any folks who are going to be there, it can be hard to plug into what's happening. Some Cons are set up well for newcomers and others aren't. Also, no matter if it encourages newcomers or not, you may be pitching games in a way that doesn't work for the Con.<br/><br/>2. If you're in a new place, showing up and just playing whatever other people offer is not a bad deal. You get to plug into what's already going on, meet some people, and get a feel for it.<br/><br/>3. Running indie games in regular Con slots can be a crapshoot. Often, people haven't heard of them or are just there to play Pathfinder or whatever. However, some Cons have a seperate indie games track or a large supportive community of folks who like trying different games. If the Con you attended doesn't have those, then drumming up interest in indie games can be tough. Most Cons I go to now, I play nothing but indie games because the community turns out in force and essentially provides a seperate mini-con for ourselves within the larger Con environment (GameStorm, PAX, etc.).<br/><br/>4. Sounds like you had a crappy time. That sucks, and I hope it hasn't spoiled your desire to try playing games with other folks. Hopefully talking about it here can make your next experiment better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy" title="TotallyGuy"><img alt="TotallyGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">TotallyGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409103/#Comment_409103" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-15T09:01:45+00:00" title="March 15, 2013  9:01AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I've had people tell me that they signed up because they like the media that I listed in the game description as inspirations for the game's tone.</blockquote>\nI think I'll do that.

It suggests a level of game organisation that just doesn't happen. <br/><br/>In general, there are some slots that start at the same time and nominally end at the same time. People offer up some games to run in those slots on a voluntary basis. Sometimes people will specify which slot they will be running a game in, but often they decide when they get there based on what they want to play and a feel for when it might fit in.<br/><br/>Outside of that model, Furnace decides all of its games in advance and has no games organised on the spot unless someone subverts the system and runs a Slot 0 on the Friday night (ahem...) Conception has a 'Living' set of games going on that run pretty much in the same schedule but muster earlier and have a different sign up board.<br/><br/>Footfall, we're talking 50-150 for most Cons with the odd exception maybe hitting 5-600 people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy" title="TotallyGuy"><img alt="TotallyGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">TotallyGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409109/#Comment_409109" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-15T09:24:04+00:00" title="March 15, 2013  9:24AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I went into a room for an event called "Indie Explosion" at a con in Edinburgh last easter.

My morning game ran, albeit with only three players- I would have preferred four or five- but my afternoon one didn't, probably for reasons broadly similar to those you cite in your OP. Although I got there in plenty of time, I didn't realise sign-ups for all three slots went up at once, so I was slow off the mark in putting the afternoon one down, which could have been why it didn't run. <br/><br/>Professional and elegant looking sign-up sheets- yes, I always forget to do this, and am reduced to scribbling down synopses in my dreadful spidery hand. I agree with 'movie night' type descriptors rather than tags, to put folks in the mood and interested in the game in general rather than the system, setting or GM. I guess some would call that 'creating a buzz'; whatever, it's worth doing. And you've probably noticed in the Thanks thread on the con forum on UKRP a discussion about whether or not to put usernames on sign-up sheets. The advantage of this is that folks who know you from the forum (as you say, building up an online presence is also useful here, and I know you're doing that cos I recognise your id from discussions on UKRP that you've participated in) could well sign up to play your game based on knowing you through your username. <br/><br/>One of the things you'll find as you GM at more and more cons is that folks from one con often go to others, and this will work in your favour because if you run a popular game at one con and the players in that game attend another one your'e also at you've got a head start with those people; hopefully they'll tell their gamer buddies about that fab game you ran at *Con. Judd's right about inviting folks to your game, but you've obviously got to get your approach right: too 'in yer face' and you'll push people away, too reserved and you won't get any response, good or bad. Going back to my previous point, if you're by the sign-up table and someone who played one of your games at another con is also there, they might well be prompted to say to their friends 'Hey, sign up for this game, I played it at *Con, it's great fun'.<br/><br/>As for what type of game to offer, sure, don't bother offering CoC at Indiemeet and hesitate to offer a game poem at Conception, but other than that the main prolem you have with new and unusal games or systems is the lack of exposure, and there's really no way round this but to keep plugging them. W00hoo's right about viral marketing, gathering players in advance via the forums, but aside from that and the above solutions and observations it's the long slog. But don't be disheartened, it's happened to everyone at some point in their GMing career.  As Jason said it looks like you've got a handle on possible solutions, and as J_Walton says hopefully just talking about it here has helped.  <br/><br/>Keep on keeping on dude!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409174/#Comment_409174" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-15T15:43:08+00:00" title="March 15, 2013  3:43PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're essentially hunting, and like hunting, traps often end up empty.

Write a competent-looking blurb. Look as though you know what you're doing.<br/>2. Run something that people are excited about.<br/><br/>And I think the following things don't matter:<br/><br/>1. You don't need to be a Big Name. (At Concrete Cow, I don't think there are <i>really</i> big names.)<br/>2.

Recently, I've noticed it's become essential to arrive well before 10, to ensure you get a game. Perhaps it's become true that you need to put games up early too. I don't know.<br/><br/>Concrete Cow seems to like indie games, with a dash of trindie games such as Marvel RPG. I wonder if Burning Wheel didn't sign up because <i>people know it too well</i>.

That's a particularly odd slot because a fair number of people leave early as they've travelled a long way and only do 2 slots (weaklings! ;-)  )  and if the rest are anything like me they are particularly choosey in that slot. It's also where the big names that are there (namely Scott, James &amp; Neil) tend to come in to their own with large sign ups. For me, I always aim to finish the Cow with a solid game where I either know the GM, the game, or the other players well. Often a bit of all three. I've got a long drive home and I want to start it energised from a good game so while I might risk something for the first 2 slots, the final one is just that bit more important with game choice. Equally, I'll not offer in that slot.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409187/#Comment_409187" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-15T16:26:26+00:00" title="March 15, 2013  4:26PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2013 4:27PM by Graham.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, yes, definitely.

So if your game is something a bit away from the conventions usual focus advetising there might get people to mark it in their timetables and also you can prevent conflict. Like offering a second Burning Wheel game in the same timeslot.<br/>I mostly run popular games at Conventions like Call of Cthulhu or The Dark Eye, both have a build in audience. I got a bit of a reputation as one of the good GMs (especially when it comes to horror) at the hometown con. Just by attending it multiple times. So now people love to have me attend. I safe spots for friends too, so there often allready is a name on the list when I put up the sheet. So people see they won't be the first to join.<br/>On the sheet (and the preregistration on the internet) I usually put a title for the scenario and then the system I will run it in. I usually prepare characters or create them with the players. A little trailer like blurb that explains the mood of the scenario is helpful too and for systems people don't know a little bit about the system too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409283/#Comment_409283" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-16T13:56:16+00:00" title="March 16, 2013  1:56PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run games at cons for nearly 25 years and it it not uncommon for games to not go off.

People are only going to browse through it, so make it very short and as interesting as you can.<br/>- Always be welcoming and inviting when people ask questions about what you're doing.<br/>- Get friendly with whoever is running the con, because people will ask the staff what's fun and cool to do, and you want them to have you in mind.<br/><br/>And lastly, just put in a few conventions.  We offered up indie/small-press games at Dragon*Con for years before anyone sought us out.  Especially at these once a year events, the pace is slow.  If you want PLAYERS NOW you have to offer up the game they are already playing.  It's hard, but try not to take it personally.<br/><br/>Thanks for having the enthusiasm to try.

Good if it's the latter with the others, if it's the former I would also be wondering GM'd or GMless and how much does system matter? I have no idea what these games are (actually, I'd be presuming 'Crossroads' is some form of *World game so if I was right would know a bit more because of it) and am going to spend some of my finite 'being at a Con' resource on them so as written they wouldn't hook me. Not saying they wouldn't get others though. <br/><br/>If they were the only 4 games on offer then 'Crossroads' would be getting my sign up as it feels like the least unknown and the actual blurb sounds the most tempting for what I like to play.<br/><br/>Hope that helps in some way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409333/#Comment_409333" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-17T08:54:40+00:00" title="March 17, 2013  8:54AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2013 9:21AM by catty_big.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Throw together a good hook (situation) and don't mention the game's name unless it's required or important.

But that may be because I run a lot of 3:16 and its flavour for me is very much not 'kill all aliens'. I mean, they turn up and you kill them, yeah, but it's so far from the focus of the game I run that I'd worry about what I was going to get if it was the bit it was sold on. <br/><br/>Specifically for 3:16 I'd want to know tone as I signed up for the game. Trying to recreate Aliens is one option, Carry On Stormtrooping is another...<br/><br/>I guess it's pretty obvious I'm not a fan of bait &amp; switch as a sign up sheet method...<br/><br/>On the 'what I do' front my created sheets will have the bottom half dedicated to space to sign names, show when and where the game is being run, who by and what system. The top half will have a pretty picture on the left hand side, often the cover shot for the game I'm running. The right hand side will be blurb on the game. If it's a GM led game then it'll be flavour text. More often than not if it's GMLess we'll be doing Prep at table so it'll be much more objective 'this is the stuff we'll do' rather than emotive. I tend to add tags at the bottom of the blurb for the time challenged.<br/><br/>I like the punters to arrive at the table with an idea of what they are going to get (because I like turning up at the table with an idea what I'm going to get).<br/><br/>Going further, my Con sign up sheet for Ribbon Drive has the following written on it next to the cover picture from the game. I consider this as wordy as I'd ever like to get, but in this instance I'd prefer to put a player off than have someone looking to turn up to a game where they can roll dice, kick ass and take names.<br/><br/><i>Ribbon Drive is a game about telling the story of a group of people on a road trip. It\u2019s about deciding who they are, what they want and then discovering if they get it or not. The game is GMless with everyone taking one of the characters on the road trip. It is focused sharply on telling their stories with each player framing scenes along the way and moving the story along, or bringing obstacles that may detour it off in unforeseen directions.<br/>The game is based around the mix tapes that get played in the stereo while on the open road. Every player can bring along their own themed mix CD, but I have a bunch with me so it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t have one. We randomly choose a CD and get the game going. We\u2019ll listen to the first two songs and use them to generate the road trip and the characters that are in it. From there the game plays with CD\u2019s in the background, sometimes this comes to the fore, sometimes you barely realise it\u2019s there, but you\u2019ll be surprised how big a difference it has on the game.<br/>The game is very mechanics light but also manages to shine the spotlight on the wants and needs of the characters within it. What rules there are are easy to learn and often barely needed.<br/><b>[tags - GMless, Story focussed, Music based, Heavy player interaction, Minimal system, Adult Themes]</b></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy" title="TotallyGuy"><img alt="TotallyGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">TotallyGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409423/#Comment_409423" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-18T05:05:36+00:00" title="March 18, 2013  5:05AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would rather be upfront about system.

And yes I do know that 3:16 is more about the character interaction than just going to various planets and slaughtering the inhabitants.

If they wanted to make the character interaction a focus of the game, they would've put that in the pitch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409447/#Comment_409447" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-18T07:54:05+00:00" title="March 18, 2013  7:54AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes it just doesn't work out. <br/><br/>Two years ago at Gen Con I was the only person scheduled to run a game of Burning Empires. I had 6 slots, and it was booked withing the firt 30min of registration. Over the next few months I got several request from other people to join the game, and I told all them to please stop by to see if there was room. I had a few flyers up pointing the way to the table, and enthused emails from almost all of the players and they had picked their characters out ahead of time on my website. <br/><br/>Not a single person ever showed up, and they had to pay to play in games at Gen Con.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Generating demand for your con games - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18124/generating-demand-for-your-con-games/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Generating demand for your con games - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18124/generating-demand-for-your-con-games/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Wow.

Yup there's the fact that I have a way that I run 3:16, but it wasn't so much that I'd turn up and go, oh I'd have liked character interaction in my 3:16, more that I've seen 'kill all aliens' 3:16 games and they tend to get a bit samey quite quickly. There's not actually a lot of meat in the alien killing side of things. Now I suspect knowing the Con catty_big was talking about that this wouldn't be the issue because the person running the game may well have also written the game... But I also know people who've played that very gung ho 3:16 style at Cons and come out with a 'wasted 3 hours' feel because it's possible to run the system in a quite dull fashion that way.<br/><br/>So, to cut an exceedingly long story short :-)  <br/><br/>If I wanted to 'kill all aliens' and signed up for that I'd be a bit miffed to sit at the table and find I was using 3:16 to do it because I'd be worried that the game has already taken a step on the path to mediocrity. I'd try very hard to make that not happen (it's a very rare game I'm brave/sensible enough to walk out of) but I'd wish I'd known before scribbling my name down.<br/><br/>More importantly <blockquote>Not a single person ever showed up, and they had to pay to play in games at Gen Con. </blockquote> that's terrible :-/ <br/>Players huh?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy" title="TotallyGuy"><img alt="TotallyGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">TotallyGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409454/#Comment_409454" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-18T08:39:15+00:00" title="March 18, 2013  8:39AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember one time I was running a game at a convention, the slot would have ended at 1:00 AM.

When I sat down at the table it quickly became clear that he hadn't intended very much at all other than to simply run his mate's game (he knew Gregor personally, in fact Gregor turned up to say Hi halfway through). Not saying that was a problem, or that the GM lacked focus, or that it wasn't a cracking game, it was- all the players brought an Imperial ton of enthusiasm and really got stuck into their characters. Having said that, we all roleplayed them in a pretty cardboard way, which the game seemed to encourage; perhaps if it had been tagged as character-focused we'd have played it differently.<br/><br/>As to the bait and switch thing, like Harlequin I'm in two minds: it sure is a good way to get bums on seats, but the potential for disappointment is great; remember, playing one game is always at the opportunity cost of playing another, especially if one is hovering over two or three sign-ups but in the end plumps for the one with the sassy elevator pitch.

For about 2 years (the con runs 3 times a year, so that means about 6 cons), he would schedule a Friday evening slot with Mystery LARP. And the description would be something to the effect of "It's a mystery to me too. I don't know what the game will be. I might come up with an idea while I'm driving up. Or maybe I'll make up something on the spot. We'll see."<br/><br/>He would usually get decent turnout. But he'd been running games there for years, and was working for AEG at the time.<br/><br/>It was pretty much a coin flip as to whether the game would be fun or not. But back then, my time was a less valuable commodity than I currently consider it, so I was totally willing to take the gamble. And I have a soft spot for game experiments.<br/><br/>I remember one of the games, the only "mechanic" was a box of "my name is..." type stickers, and a marker to write on them. jim would ask some provocative questions, and then let your answers inspire what he wrote on your label. Then later, you could come talk to him again and he might change your labels. If I remember correctly, we discovered after a while that we were souls in purgatory. That one came out on the positive side of the coin flip, but kind of just barely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409509/#Comment_409509" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-18T17:09:48+00:00" title="March 18, 2013  5:09PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Oh yeah!
