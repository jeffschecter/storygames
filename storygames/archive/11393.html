It was THREE SESSIONS LONG. That's right. Three sessions long, and took a month to play.<br/><br/>There are some good reasons for this: we were playing online, using Skype and a Vassal module I created (and need to revise), and all four of us...okay, mainly me and Matt are long-winded and have a tendency to go off on (awesome and enlightening) tangents. Also we don't start playing until 11 EST on Thursday nights, and we are all married, with demanding jobs and kids. This brings down the energy levels quite a bit.<br/><br/>The first session dragged a little, and it took us two hours to get set up and play through five scenes. Then we skipped a week. The second session, we were all very tired and finished the first act and the Tilt.<br/><br/>This week, we all had plenty of sleep and caffeine, and we tore through the second act in a little over an hour. The story was hilarious and dark, and Bryan wants me to do a full write-up just in case a film producer happens to be in the habit of reading actual play reports. I think I'll get around to that eventually, along with a real review, but the brain isn't quite up to par this week.<br/><br/>I really liked the way the initial elements were chosen, and the elements themselves inspired a fun and memorable story. The only criticism I have is that I'd like incorporating the elements have some sort of mechanical tie-in with the fiction, but the fiction that emerged didn't really need that, which I guess is the point. It helped that the whole group was familiar with the kinds of fiction that Fiasco is attempting to recreate, and that everyone in our group is pretty experienced at running games.<br/><br/>Fiasco did what it said it would do. The rules were simple, well written, and the playsets helped us create some really funny, brutal story.<br/><br/>I want to play Fiasco again. I'd like to play it early afternoon after a good night's sleep. I'd like to play it with Jason, so I can see if there are any nuances I've missed (and also because I think it would be awesome to play with Jason). I'm going to try playing it with some actors and filmmakers I know, non-gamers, to see how it works out.<br/><br/>If anyone (especially experienced Fiascoteers) wants to organize an online Fiasco in a couple of weeks, let me know and we'll get something happening.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253627/#Comment_253627" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T00:05:14+00:00" title="January 29, 2010 12:05AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason likes to make fun of me because I can't get a game of Fiasco done in 2 1/2 hours like he does. But three sessions?! I bow to you.<br/><br/>Which playset did you use?<br/><br/>How was the experience of playing the game over Skype? Was it tough to come back to the game after a break? I find that the story gets pretty tight very quickly, so I was wondering if you had any continuity issues. Did you take notes for the next sessions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253629/#Comment_253629" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T00:41:07+00:00" title="January 29, 2010 12:41AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We used the Southern Town playset. Lots of Alabama jokes were made at my expense.<br/><br/>Playing over Skype wasn't a problem, especially since we were using a virtual game table:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://brennenreece.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/FiascoMap-e1264754169341.png"/><br/>I'd give out the module, but as you can see, it needs a little help. When I play again, I'd like to use EpicTable (the VT John has been working on which is nearing Alpha). He incorporated index cards into the program specifically because of Fiasco.<br/><br/>It was tough to come back to it, but it think that was due more to our energy levels than anything else.<br/><br/>Continuity wasn't a problem since the story was so damn memorable. John took notes, but I don't think anyone really needed them. We all regret that we couldn't get our sessions recorded.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253640/#Comment_253640" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T05:28:05+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  5:28AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa, is this the game you invited me to play?
