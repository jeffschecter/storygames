Not to learn lessons from someones personal soapbox.<b>Doing anything else besides playing a game for fun is deeply irresponsible, and dangerous.</b><br/><br/>I won't delve into your background--but think on this: Do you have years of experience in the field you want to teach on? The appropriate training? Professional, and moral ethics as held to a doctor, psychologist or similar professional in such a field? A few decades worth of field tests for the game? Studies to back up your methods of teaching?<br/><br/>It be better to approach the world as a journalist, a preacher, a teacher or other person interested in doing good works. Tabletop RPG's? Isn't the place.<br/><br/>I'll be honest: I hope much the same that people learn to overcome these complex and selfish issues for the good of others.  Yet would you want me to utilize my personal stance (which happens to be religious) via a game to teach you how to change things?</blockquote>\nQuoted from another thread.<br/>Matthijs suggested that this line of inquiry be cast into its own thread.<br/>Enter thread.<br/><br/>Straight up, I believe something very different than Silverlion.<br/><br/>I believe that engaging in story, and <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/imaginary-funerals/" rel="nofollow">constructing experiences</a>, it's a vital avenue for learning and growing and seeing new perspectives. Story games can <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/how-to-be-quiet-together/" rel="nofollow">teach us new skills</a>, and help us re-train how we look at <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/no/" rel="nofollow">old skills</a>.<br/><br/>When Silverlion asks if he should use his "personal stance (which happens to be religious)" to teach me how to change things?<br/>Yes.<br/><br/>As a staunch existentialist, I don't get a lot of meaningful interaction with religious ideas. I get a lot of tacky surface stuff, like cheesy fliers about how Jesus is the light. But I don't get a lot of meaningful depth to that exposure.<br/><br/>And, the meaningful depth and exposure I do get is never in an atmosphere where I can really digest it and play with it. It's in a serious, real world atmosphere where I'm more concerned with defending my own beliefs than hearing yours, unfortunately.<br/><br/>What if there was a way to explore and dive into and play with these ideas, in a playful and safe space, where we could check our own baggage at the door and really immerse? What if we could play with big ideas, big consequences and big choices... but rest assured that the weight of world wasn't on our shoulders?<br/><br/>We could learn so much better! Share so much better! Listen so much better!<br/>And doesn't that set up sound familiar?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282896/#Comment_282896" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T08:05:42+00:00" title="July 26, 2010  8:05AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll go a little further.

Not all of them are explicitly and intentionally trying to convert us to their point of view, but it's safe to say that we will like those things more if we agree with them, and that they're going to do their level best to make us like 'em.  Doesn't matter if we're talking about <i>Fahrenheit 9/11</i> or <i>Left Behind</i> or "Friends" or a Lady Gaga video.<br/><br/>So on that level, yeah, I'm fine with the idea of games -- which have to be written by someone at some point -- having an agenda.  These things aren't created in a vacuum, after all.<br/><br/>I get a bit twitchier when people start talking about how to write a game with the explicit intention of teaching something, but only because I worry that it'll make the game less fun even for people who already agree with and approve of whatever point of view is being taught.  (I don't worry about people who disagree, because most of them just won't play it, the same way that most people won't watch a TV show that doesn't appeal to them.)  If you can make a good, fun game and say what you want to say at the same time, more power to you.<br/><br/><br/>There's one area in which I absolutely, 100% agree with Silverlion, though, and that's when we get around to the idea of games-as-therapy.  That's a realm for qualified experts: people who have training, professional ethics, and oversight.  You want to make a therapeutic game, you need to work closely with people who know what the fuck they're doing, because good intentions without the necessary expertise can do more harm than good.  "Deeply irresponsible and dangerous" is a mild way to describe it, in my opinion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282936/#Comment_282936" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T11:17:37+00:00" title="July 26, 2010 11:17AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Wow, you guys all agree<i>so hard!</i><br/><br/>I wonder what the guy you are all dogpiling thinks?

Any game that overtly has some message it carries usually turns me off. Dogs in the Vineyard is one such example, and I only got interested in it because it mechanically does what I want it to do, which ends up having nothing to do with meaning. I also found BSG rather trite with the religious overtones. Even Poison'd doesn't appeal to me given that it tries to drive the message that pirates are nasty, nasty, people. <br/><br/>Now if it's a covert message, I could handle it. I know plenty of people who watch Star Trek just for the fun of it, and they don't see any of the underlying messages, while others only like it because of the underlying messages. That's cool, but if you can't tune out the message and just enjoy, it'll simply turn a lot of people off the game and never be popular. I guess game wise there's A Dirty World - it is about words being more damaging than weapons, and is quite appropriate in a game whose medium is words, but you can set that aside and just have fun telling a story using the creative mechanics, or also to shift the emphasis on that which puts Goku and Vegeta and Chichi and Bulma on equal footing - a way of balancing characters that are inherrently unbalanced with other mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282937/#Comment_282937" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T11:19:25+00:00" title="July 26, 2010 11:19AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1 on the games-as-therapy front.

The glory of god part is just color. Like fighting for Pelor, Paladine, or the Flying Spaghetti Monster. There is actually no need for it, and hence why Dogs can be played in many setting, not just frontier fantasy-Utah. It is unfortunate that people can't get past the color to see the game inside.

There is a difference between my beliefs shaping game aspects, unintentionally from my point of view, and the process of intentionally creating a game designed to convey a specific moral soapbox.<br/><br/>I specifically feel that any probing into psychological issues is too dangerous and SHOULD get someone brought up on criminal charges, if they do so in the guise of a game, unless they are at the least a trained professional counselor using said play/game in a therapeutic environment. (A Role playing game group, not therapeutic environment for the record.)<br/><br/><br/>Some information to understand my background:<br/><br/>I've actually accidentally triggered one players claustrophobia unintentionally.<br/><br/>I've been approached after games because the player's who played (online) felt I was religious and wanted to talk about it at one point. I did not intentionally include moral or religious specifics of my particular beliefs, I did however present religion as positive in this case. I've done the same with beliefs not my own, and have done so as fairly as I can.<br/><br/>I only run games where the PC's are heroes. I don't find exploring the darker side of things interesting, mature, or in anyway entertaining. It is too easy a path to vicarious thrills, and power fantasies, and far far to easy--even for me, to role-play. <br/><br/>I once wrote a superhero story about myself with powers. The end result is NOT pretty, and I'm fully aware, that with the best intentions of such powers, I would slip into being a tyrant. (I just want people to be nice, WHY won't you be nice!") can move from a general moral compass to a dictate upon others. I'm comfortable knowing that I would do my best to do good in real life, and would fight and die for what I believed to be good, and sometimes "good" is protecting other peoples rights to completely disagree with me, but I also know that I take dim view on some peoples actions.<br/><br/>I believe in Evil. I don't believe it needs supernatural impetus, but I believe humans like us, exist who are evil. There are people damaged by society, who can be helped, but there are a lot of people who NEVER will, because they are evil. <br/><br/>I am Christian (but a liberal one with rather stringent views on not having the knowledge to judge peoples actions--I don't know enough, I can but warn them of the dangers I perceive in their choices and leave it God, to sort it out.)<br/><br/>I've been  diagnosed Bi Polar: Type 2, Hypomanic, no psychosis, and with extreme anxiety. I've seen the dangers of mental health PROFESSIONALS who suck at their jobs, so I am always very worried when people think they can change the world by sorting out problems even professionals wrestle with. I've not met a game designer yet I'd want to be delving anywhere into that murky place.  (I'm relatively stable, on medication and in constant counseling--events occurred just prior to the release of Hearts &amp; Souls, that triggered this illness and is not genetic.) .I went from being a relatively functional semi-professioanl customer representative who loved working with people to a virtual recluse. I only went outside my home to see the doctor, counselor, and to game with one group who got my illness well enough and made me as comfortable as they could with their rather abrasive natures. (I love em to death for not changing that even when I was suffering they supported me in their way.) I lost track of several dozen sets of friends locally for a long time, because of that. However, unlike many who suffer these illnesses, I was not willing to stop fighting, not easily. I also am not stupid enough to go off the medications I'm on unless they stop working, or start threatening my life with other health concerns, unlike some bipolars. (I will likely be medicated for life.)<br/><br/><br/>However, Matthijs said he was focused more on teaching people to not be stupid.Which is not necessarily a psychological issue, but does veer very close to it in considerable ways that make it worrisome. Especially since stupidity is highly subjective.<br/><br/>The idea of improving critical thinking, is important to me as well. I just don't think gaming is the way to do so.<br/><br/>How do you think a game can teach critical thinking (that is "not stupidity" as close as I can word it, without delving into deeper issues that are dangerous?<br/><br/>Morally speaking since gaming is not a religion, but essentially a toy--a play thing, a hobby. IS it even appropriate it address such territory?<br/><br/>Why should gaming be the vehicle for it--instead of journalism/lecturing/teaching?<br/><br/>Do you think anyone will buy a game based on the idea of teaching someone's soapbox? (Besides the already sold to choir--like academic papers written to other academics?)<br/><br/><br/>Would this discussion have more suitable method? (So not as to mess up the Zen, as Andy put it.)<br/><br/>Alternately is anyone willing to consider being in error such a polarizing topic? If not, best just to let it go and drop the discussion. I'm more than willing to consider other viewpoints, though I'm not sure how much if at all that will impact my view.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283008/#Comment_283008" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T18:14:07+00:00" title="July 26, 2010  6:14PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 26, 2010 6:19PM by nemomeme.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Silverlion</cite>There are people damaged by society, who can be helped, but there are a lot of people who NEVER will, because they are evil.</blockquote>There's a lot you said that I think is worthy of debate and discussion.  And I think almost all of your concerns are legitimate.  I <i>personally</i> find this part of your world view more troubling than the prospect of any role-playing game designer trying to subtly teach a moral lesson to the players of their game.<br/><br/>The thing about games is they involve a back-and-forth.  Its participants engage one another as equals and learn from one another.  A mindset that views <i>anyone</i> as a lost cause can't engage with others in that mode.<br/><br/>But here might be a possible acid test for whether it's profitable to engage you further on this topic.  Outside of the whole arena of role-playing and gaming, do you think that a professional teacher has the moral authority to attempt to teach critical thinking and ethics via standard commonly accepted teaching practices?  Even where that teaching intersects with and challenges the faith-based understanding provided by the parents or the religious institutions that previously instructed the world-view of the prospective student?  Yes?  No?  At what age?

I've dealt with  counselors doing their practicum, who essentially had no "authority" in the respect I'd use the word,  being merely further along college students than I was at the time. Yet they still had training, study, and more importantly back up and people to lean on in terms of organizational structure to help protect the people involved on both sides of the virtual table. Any authority a professional has--especially in the the vast majority of cases is because we've chosen to give it by hiring them. I had to "fire" and file complaints against one professional but at least I had the means to do that. With a game designer, or a player who isn't the designer, what does someone being exposed to game. out of controlled circumstances, have to protect them?<br/>\n<blockquote><br/>Because of the importance of joy.<br/><br/>Games are made joyfully.

You've got to be extremely cautious in some instances with even joy. Emotions, even joy, can be a tripwire to a bomb. I think joy is generally a good thing, with people who are otherwise willing to embrace it. However, I'm not sure that joy can't be had through learning from teachers, lecturers, etc. (Then again I was in the past a bit of an academic, so I may have a flawed view of them.)<br/>\n<blockquote><br/><br/>You have a friend who faces claustrophobia.<br/>You encountered that in a<i>relatively safe</i>environment.<br/></blockquote>\nExcept of course I lost the friend as a player for further games. Triggering emotional responses can happen, I've had it happen to me and other player in play, however, when the emotions, even in a safe environment can be hurtful, human nature is to avoid hurt, embracing it to learn, takes a specific thought process, that a game cannot guarantee to facilitate because of the differing backgrounds and viewpoints people possess.\n<blockquote><br/>You learned something about the person.

I think its more the subjective nature of the lesson that's at issue. (Teaching math skills is fine, book keeping too.) Of course I also encourage the game for young children to be overseen by their own parent, which is allegedly the person supposed to be most watchful in regards to what their children are exposed too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283017/#Comment_283017" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T18:44:25+00:00" title="July 26, 2010  6:44PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 26, 2010 6:49PM by migo.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: blankshield</cite>Dogs is no more about fighting for the glory of god than is your average D&amp;D cleric or paladin.

The moment I see an indication that the game's trying to send some message, I look elsewhere.<br/><br/>The reason being, if there's some sort of message, it takes precedence over the entertainment. If a game tries to convey how deadly and nasty fighting is, the game will have a system like TRoS, which on the surface looks awesome, but in practice you end up never using the combat system because it just isn't fun. So then there's no point in having the detailed combat if it'll just be a coin toss to see who's absolutely slaughtered and you try to avoid fights at every turn. Now TRoS went in with the purpose of making realistic fighting, so I gave it a look. There was a game I saw about medics (maybe Grey Ranks, or I'm possibly confusing it with something else), I took a short look and decided I'd rather read a book about it. There was another one about black slaves, again, I didn't give it another look. <br/><br/>If the game is very clearly a toolkit for me to play the stories I want to play, then I'm interested. If the game looks like a vehicle to deliver a message from the author, then I'm simply not interested, because it stops being my game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283018/#Comment_283018" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T18:49:40+00:00" title="July 26, 2010  6:49PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Silverlion</cite>I like the way you've put that, while I agree that's important.

Loss of relationships, mental illness, and resultant loss of the employment that you seem to have loved. These things will shape your perception of life and the world. What I am hearing from you is that you have very little trust for people and their intentions for you, and that one of the few gages that you use to test reliability of a person when handling your mental state is professional status. Even then, you say that there are many bad professionals. That is a tough place to be in, and I can definitely sympathise with it.<br/><br/>To share some of myself, I am a senior medical student. I am in the midst of applying to residencies. I would like to share with you a little about games, specifically role playing games, in medical education. This hopefully will shed some light on the professionals who are helping you with your mental illness.<br/><br/>Roleplaying games are core to medical education. Every doctor who graduates from medical school and plans to practice in the US will have roleplayed to some degree. In order to get a spot in a residency in the US you must pass the US Medical Licencing Exams Step 2 Clinical Skills Test. Big name for an elaborate and expensive LARP. Medical students in their 4th year of medical school will converge on a handfull of cities and "pretend to be doctors treating patients". There are rules that I won't get into here, but the gist is that they set up a faux clinic, and you rotate to 12 different patient rooms. Each room has a paid professional actor that you interact with, diagnose, counsel, and then write orders and a clinic note for. There are certain actions that you just pretend to do because of danger and discomfort, such as rectal exams and female pelvic and breast exams. But it is all pretend. No one is sick. And you pass if you play well enough.<br/><br/>This is not the only example of roleplay in medical school. It is used extensively for exactly what this thread is about. Subjects that are difficult to talk about, that make people uncomfortable thinking about, or are just outside of the experiences of most students, we role play them. It sets up a safe place to practice, it allows for an audience and feedback, and it decreases anxiety of students considerably. Subjects such as sex, drugs, drinking, money, homosexuality, religion, cross cultural medicine, and end of life care are some but not all of the areas that medical students role play pretty extensively prior to ever interacting with a patient. They are considered invaluable to medical education, and most people would say that a medical school that doesn't engage in these activities is not worth going to. Your education will suffer.<br/><br/>To give you an idea about how these role playing sessions are actually games and not just free form role playing, I will relate my most recent session. I am currently doing a palliative care rotation. This is the branch of medicine that deals with helping patients make decisions in situations where there are really no good options. The most difficult aspects of this class are that you have to help patients make decisions about care when there is no option that is curative, and the other options have significant negative side effects. Most patients are going to die. Soon. There is a ton of loss that you have to deal with. The stories and relationships are amazing. It is uncomfortable even for people who are good at it.<br/><br/>So here is the game. We were lead through a guided experience. We were instructed to create these cards that each had one thing of significant value to us, each within one of 5 spheres: things we possess, relationships, activities we love, objects in nature of significant meaning to us, and goals that we have for our lives. This gave us each a deck of 20 cards with all the most important things to each of us. We were then told to imagine that we were the character in the following fiction, and the more we immersed ourselves in it the more we would gain from it. The "GM" then read a piece from our perspective that related finding a lump in our armpit, relating it to the doctor, biopsy of the lump, the wait for initial diagnosis, the actual diagnosis of cancer, the treatment, the relapse, the further treatment, the non-response to treatment, the slow decline, and eventual death. Throughout this reading, the "GM" would stop and we were asked to lose a couple of cards at each dramatic moment. Some losses were chosen, some were randomly chosen by a partner. There was one episode of recovery of cards. It was amazingly difficult losing each thing that was important to you. Eventually, you were left, contemplating the very end of your life, left with nothing as you left this world. All 12 of the participants in this exercise were left crying, with a significant sense of loss, and a new understanding. There is no way to really relate the feelings that I got from this exercise, but the exercise reliably created the same experience in all participants.<br/><br/>The understanding gain was that each of us had different things on our cards. Each thing was really important to the owner of the card, but there were some that were more important than others. My experience of taking a friend's cards left me with the thought that I would have liked to be able to ask her what cards she wanted me to take. I devastated her because I took the relationship that was most important to her and the place that meant the most to her. She cried when I did it. To be able to avoid taking those would have been the most humane thing possible at that moment. In real life, we each have imaginary cards, each person has different cards, and through my actions, I will end up taking cards away from my patients. Therapies always have both positive and negative consequences. I will now always ask which cards they value most. My patients deserve that.<br/><br/>In this exercise, I learned a great deal about my own values, my mortality, but for my practice, I have gained an empathy that it would have taken terrible mistakes to learn without the game. The cost would have been great for my patients, but also for my psyche. I do not need to make those mistakes now.<br/><br/>All of the professionals who help you have used role playing games. They have become better healers because of it. Games not only can teach valuable lessons, in my life, some of the most valuable lessons have come directly from role playing games.<br/><br/>The creative use of play can create safe environments for the exploration of dangerous subjects. Simulation has a huge role in the education of people who will manage difficult and dangerous situations. Role playing games, especially table top RPGs, reign supreme in situations where relationships are central to the dangerous subjects. To say that they are too dangerous to use is to throw away a powerful tool for transformation and preparation. Neither the military nor medicine will ever give up RPGs as teaching tools. Their use in other areas is inevitable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283031/#Comment_283031" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T21:16:46+00:00" title="July 26, 2010  9:16PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 26, 2010 9:21PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>Games aren't a special privileged place.

Just because you choose (and I use that word deliberately) to put something uncomfortable or painful into your gaming doesn't mean that you've magically removed it from real life.  It just means you've put it into your gaming, too.<br/><br/>And I would argue that whether putting it into a gaming situation is going to be helpful in real life or not is going to depend very heavily on whether you knew what you were doing.

I think that the lessons that games can teach do not always require training or oversight. What training did Homer, or Shakespear, or Harper Lee have that would prepare them to teach us about life? There are many people who can teach us about meaning in life who have no professional training. And there is no oversight. <br/><br/>RPGs are another artform that can convey meaning, with themes and narrative. Art can transform and enrich us. I would be afraid of the governing body that was set up to regulate which artist were sanctioned to provide us with aproved art. I would be afraid of the meaning instilled by those governing bodies. Art must always remain democratic, and a tool of the people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283040/#Comment_283040" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T22:38:00+00:00" title="July 26, 2010 10:38PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 26, 2010 10:45PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, let's say <b>I have a soapbox</b>, and I stand on it and yell, "Question authority!" all day long.  I rail against blind obedience, and everyone knows that's my opinion.  The people who agree might salute me with a fist pump, the people who disagree might yell, "Shut up!"  Just as likely, the people who find me entertaining will salute, and the people who find my voice grating will yell.<br/><br/>Now let's say that next to my soapbox <b>I have a big chart full of statistics</b> illustrating that humans are better off, individually and collectively, when they question authority.  Now I'm inviting a new reception.  In addition to agree/disagree and like/dislike, I've now got convinced/unconvinced/curious.  Most people will be skeptical of my stats, or just not care about them, but maybe a few people will go, "Oh wow, I didn't know <i>that!</i>  I guess I should question authority!"  Or at least get partway there: "<i>Maybe</i> I should question <i>some</i> authority..."<br/><br/>Now let's say that my soapbox and charts <b>come with hypnotic projections</b> that guide everyone through a brief simulation of following authority to death and bucking it to prosperity.  So now they have an experience that supports my claim.  We've still got the range of reactions, but maybe most are stronger ("annoyed" -&gt; "really annoyed"), and maybe, if I've done a good job with my simulation, more people are convinced I'm right.<br/><br/>And finally, let's say that <b>I'm wearing a clown suit</b>, and so everyone who comes near is thinking thoughts of light entertainment, and is not prepared to be critical of the experience that's about to hit them.  So now maybe I get fewer skeptical reactions, and convince a few more people.<br/><br/><b>Best case:</b> I've just convinced a small percentage (but as high as I could!) of the people who heard me to behave in a constructive manner.  <br/><br/><b>Worst case:</b> I've just convinced a small percentage (but as high as I could!) of the people who heard me to behave in a destructive manner. <br/><br/>So.  Should someone stop me?  Should I have stopped myself?  Or should everyone else just be expected to make their own judgments, the same way they're free to buy or not buy every product they've ever seen advertised?<br/><br/>Once it's clearly proven that I'm giving bad advice, then hopefully my community will warn people about me.  But until then, <b>I'm comfortable saddling my audience with the responsibility to decide for themselves</b> whether to buy what I'm selling on my soapbox.<br/><br/><b>Caveat:</b> in real life, I'm not a hypnotic clown on a soapbox, and I certainly <b>wouldn't offer a message-heavy or emotionally intense RPG experience to someone I knew to be very impressionable or fragile</b>.  I'd be looking out for that, though of course I'd appreciate it if anyone just plain told me!

They have become better healers because of it. Games not only can teach valuable lessons, in my life, some of the most valuable lessons have come directly from role playing games.<br/><br/>The creative use of play can create safe environments for the exploration of dangerous subjects. Simulation has a huge role in the education of people who will manage difficult and dangerous situations. Role playing games, especially table top RPGs, reign supreme in situations where relationships are central to the dangerous subjects. To say that they are too dangerous to use is to throw away a powerful tool for transformation and preparation. Neither the military nor medicine will ever give up RPGs as teaching tools. Their use in other areas is inevitable.</blockquote>\n<br/>Indeed, this isn't counter to what I'm saying though.

One of the reasons I tend to write about the subjects I choose is because they interest me in some manner. Hearts &amp; Souls, takes a different tack as a superhero game, because I think comic books are more about heroism, than powers and stats--is that an un-acceptable agenda/message?<br/><br/>High Valor is a fantasy game "done right," that  is one for my tastes where the game is centered on epic choices. It has things in play like dying when one faces monsters and stopping them from harming people (by will, faith, or valor.) It's not a heavy handed handling of those choices but that in its own way is a "message."  Would that be problematic in a game based on certain folklore and epic stories, one can die--and still impact the world?<br/><br/>Tribes of Mother Night, was a setting  I wrote long ago for someone's system rather than my own, it dealt with prejudice--but it wasn't trying to send a specific message other than be what it was--a setting which had long years of prejudice and such shaping events in the world. Is it possible to touch on these things, without in essence sending a message?<br/><br/><br/>General (to everyone) I attended college for English and Speech, one of the interesting classes I took for speech (communication) was an education class called Storytelling, in it was emphasized that you interact with an audience and you tailor you stories to the audience in some manner to effectively entertain. I think this is the role of the GM in many cases is to guide things and assist the audience (the GM and players) into having fun with the game as both participants and the audience, which makes any gaming likely to create an experience that the group wants, in some manner, regardless of the writer's original goals.(Partially because players may have different desires of outcomes.) Can a distant creator find a way to improve the game by addressing this aspect of play over specific "messages" they may want to send, without sending some kind of message in and of itself?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283058/#Comment_283058" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-27T02:39:01+00:00" title="July 27, 2010  2:39AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2010 3:18AM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Silverlion</cite>Is it possible to touch on these things, without in essence sending a message?</blockquote>\n<i>Hell</i>, no.<br/><br/>When you <i>choose one word over another</i> in constructing any sentence that you write or utter, you choose between different messages.

In a controlled environment you can be more rather than less responsive to issues which arise, so if you believe the moral argument, then a film maker has a greater moral responsibility, because of the lack of interactivity. If someone is getting claustrophobic watching a film, there is nothing the flim maker can do, so the film maker has a greater responsibilty than someone running a game to consider their audience. That is why this moral argument is not persuasive to me at all. You can't censor your game designs on people's potential phobias or hang-ups. A game designed for fun could just as easily trigger a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283116/#Comment_283116" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-27T12:26:21+00:00" title="July 27, 2010 12:26PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've not bothered to read the whole thread, so I may be repeating something.<br/><br/>As soon as the soapbox becomes more important than the game, I lose interest.<br/><br/>I think there is a lot of patting one's self on the back and inflated feelings of importance when you start talking about teaching and directing morality through playing games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion" title="Silverlion"><img alt="Silverlion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/943/nF5ZRHUHC8M5A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion">Silverlion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283142/#Comment_283142" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-27T14:30:41+00:00" title="July 27, 2010  2:30PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/SimonRogers">@SimonRogers</a>:<br/>Is the film-maker morally responsible?

I mean, they are written to scare the shit out of everyone who goes by playing on our fears and comfort zones.  There are even claustrophobia horror movies in particular, where being buried alive is the main fear being played on.  I mean, The Cask of Amontillado is not scary without that.  There's another movie coming up called The Box, about a man buried alive, with a cigarette lighter and a dying cellphone.<br/><br/>To some degree I think a horror movie maker would be thrilled to take moral responsibility for scaring the shit out of an audience. <br/><br/>You seem to think they should be ashamed to?<br/><br/>I will give an example. I watched <i>The Blair Witch Project</i> with my wife (then fiancee). I was pretty bored during the movie. I didn't jump at the jumps, I didn't freak out or anything, pretty much I yawned my way through it, but that night, every time I heard a branch scratch or pebble click outside the window, I shot awake.  Essentially, the sound design of the movie was such that it made me hyper aware and paranoid.  I lay awake in the dark waiting for the Blair Witch to come and murder me, thinking that maybe I shouldn't have been so critical of the movie. The next day I was really tired, but much more happy with the film than I had been when we left the theater.  I think the makers of TBWP would be pleased with scaring the shit out of me that night and keeping me from sleeping due to the creepie crawlies. And I would high five them for doing so.

On what basis would a designer be responsible for some experience someone else had when playing their game?  They chose to play it.  They could have stopped playing it.  They chose not to stop playing it.  It triggered some issue they have that the designer had absolutely nothing to do with.  How is that in any way shape or form the designer's fault.  Regardless of what the designer intended.<br/><br/>Why would you want to even live in a world where you were at risk 24/7 of some yahoo blaming you for some bad experience they had playing your game..  <br/><br/>"Hey Tim, I played High Valor and it made me feel bad about myself because your game is all about having the courage to take a stand and rise to the occassion and stand up for what's good and right, and now I had a nervous break down because I realized I must not be a good person because I'm not strong enough to do that in real life and that's your fault and here's my medical bill..."<br/><br/>Now you might say that since you had no agenda other  than making a fun experience its not your fault.  But that's just a matter of perspective.  I've read High Valor.  Its chock full of Agenda.  I have no problem with that at all...because IMO its impossible to design anything without one.  Whether the world view you expressed in your game was just an organic development of what you personally find to be a fun experience, or something you deliberately set out to put there doesn't matter one whit to me.<br/><br/>It seems to matter a great deal to you.  I'm not seeing why, and I'm not seeing how you'd ever even be able to begin to judge which was which for any given game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283173/#Comment_283173" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-27T17:35:49+00:00" title="July 27, 2010  5:35PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I will give an example.

His own games sound from his descriptions as though they lie in that category.<br/><br/>It's category 2 that's bad/unappealing.  Let's call that the "preaching" category.  But... what RPGs do that?  <br/><br/>I think if you look at games that deal with heavy moral issues carefully, you will see that they do not do this.  Let's take Steal Away Jordan, an example at least as extreme as Grey Ranks.  One might say, "Oh, that game is in category 2 because it preaches the lesson that 'slavery is bad.'  And although of course I agree with that, I don't like it when games preach at me."  However, SAJ isn't really preachy at all, even about slavery.  The players can decide for themselves what effect being slaves has on their characters' psyches.  There's nothing in the game that would prevent a character from being a fawning lapdog for the owners if they wanted to, and then playing out what that would be like.  And that's the entire point\u2014category 3 games allow to us play with issues in a relatively safe way that is tough to do otherwise.<br/><br/>(If I wanted to design a game that *was* preachy about slavery, I'd have it give bonus dice for, like, having solidarity with the other slaves and rising up against the masters, and, like, not allow you to do anything else mechanically, such as squabble with the other slaves.)<br/><br/>So, are there category 2 games?  Well, I know it's a cliche to complain about alignment systems, but I have to say I think they're problematic at best.  However, it's the content of most games that are billed as "just fun" that are most likely to be a) preachy and b) <i>marginalizing</i>.  I know talking about minority groups and -isms is opening up a can of worms in a thread already rife with worms, but I don't think it can be avoided.  Oh, those orcs are evil and so we can just kill them and take their stuff, right?  I mean, I <i>know</i> it's a huge downer to even bring this shit up, because it's no fun to have your nostalgic childhood D&amp;D games shat on, but, I mean, I think this stuff <i>has</i> to be talked about in this thread, so I'll be the bad guy and mention it first.<br/><br/>Let me tell a story.  In the summer of '07, playing in a 3.5 game, going through this module that involved storming the caves of these lizardfolk.  Now, these lizardfolk were legitimately pretty bad dudes, so this isn't a story about questioning the entire premise of the adventure, it's about one particular encounter.  We're walking down this corridor and we see a grate.  We realize it's the top of a deep prison cell, and we see the ousted former chieftain of the lizardpeople stuck down there, having been imprisoned by his own people after losing power.  The other PCs immediately started raining arrows down on him.  I was horrified by this, and declared that my character, a Neutral Good Elven Cleric of Corellon Larethian, was going to throw his body over the grate.  A giant argument ensued that was un-fun and made me think less of my fellow players, though IIRC I eventually won and we got the guy on our side somewhat.<br/><br/>But you know what?  They were right and I was wrong, according to D&amp;D.  That ex-chieftain, even though he was helpless, unarmed, and completely not a threat, was nevertheless evil and thus a legitimate target for destruction.  Thus, I would argue that (most versions of) D&amp;D preaches the following: 1) evil is inherent to some beings, and 2) destroying evil beings using violence is always ok.  Again, let me emphasize the word <i>preaches</i>: there's no room, mechanically, for exploring the question of creatures that are inherently evil or the uses of violence.  You get XP for killing monsters and not for other things, and the alignment system says that creatures, rather than actions, are evil or not.<br/><br/>In other words\u2014guys, seriously, what games are you worried about that are going to preach to you?  That's not at all what Jason Morningstar, Joe McDonald, or any other SG designer is about.  If you want to find games that preach, you're going to have to look to games that purport to have no political agenda.<br/><br/>My conclusions are:<br/><br/>1) Don't dismiss individual games or any category of games based on superficial descriptions of their content.<br/>2) Don't assume a game is not taking a moral stance on issues, *especially* if it appears to be about something that is "just fun," like killing monsters.<br/>3) Lines and veils discussions are awesome, and more gamers should know about and use this important tool.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283198/#Comment_283198" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-27T21:55:08+00:00" title="July 27, 2010  9:55PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>It's category 2 that's bad/unappealing.

Ignoring them may be fun, but not healthy. It's like tequila. Fun in small doses, bad for you in moderate doses, and makes you a bad citizen if that is all you do. Story/indie games originally became interesting to me because they encourage grappling with difficult issues. When a game doesn't grapple with issues it becomes a stealth sermon. I will make an unnecessarily broad statement and say that all bad actions result from unexamined views, and all truly good actions result from examining and questioning views. It is only through questioning our views that we progress.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283206/#Comment_283206" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-27T22:58:21+00:00" title="July 27, 2010 10:58PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, yeah, something else\u2014my D&amp;D example reminded me of this: Silverlion, I also tend to like to play good guys.

Without getting into it, let's just say there are a whole lot of D&amp;D players and writers who absolutely disagree with both of these two statements and consider them completely addleheaded interpretations of the texts. <br/><br/>As just one data point, and again, I'm not saying your point of view is wrong, just that it isn't as obvious as all that, D&amp;D3, in the very first book, before it even gets to the combat section, says very clearly that the only monsters that have mandatory alignments are animals, who have to be neutral because they can't make moral choices, and demons, devils and angels, who are embodiments of their alignment. It specifically and explicitly spells out that any sentient beings can be good or evil, and protecting the helpless is something good characters do.  So there is ample support in the text for the way Deliverator played, and under no conceivable reading could it be said that he was <i>clearly</i> playing wrong and his kill-the-helpless friends were playing right.<br/><br/>Now, there's a reason why "alignment flamewar" is a phrase, so yeah, it could be explained a lot better, but pretending that it's a book explicitly and clearly about genocide is crazy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Because the game always has one of two possible predetermined outcomes for the protagonists, there is an argument to be made that it "takes a stance" in a way that, say, Dogs does not.  However, what I think saves it is the scene that happens when you hit weariness 1, where you *find out* in-character that your quest is doomed.

However, I don't think that all games encourage reflection on real-world morals to the same degree, or among the same people and situations.  Games definitely can lessen the moral reflection they encourage by various choices.  <br/><br/>For example, one of the choices of the Lord of the Rings movies was that they made explicit that orcs were created by magic processes as adults, and were violent from the moment of their creation.  This brief scene swept aside moral concerns about orc women and children, and to a fair degree that orcs could be rehabilitated.  There are still moral issues that are raised in the films, but not about this point regarding racial violence.  <br/><br/>I think reflection on real-world morals depends in part on a happy medium.  If the fiction is too prosaic and/or ordinary, then it may not focus reflection any more than the baseline of ordinary life.  If the fiction is too fantastical and/or outlandish, then the reader may not relate it to real life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283669/#Comment_283669" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-30T09:22:17+00:00" title="July 30, 2010  9:22AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>For example, one of the choices of the Lord of the Rings movies was that they made explicit that orcs were created by magic processes as adults, and were violent from the moment of their creation. This brief scene swept aside moral concerns about orc women and children, and to a fair degree that orcs could be rehabilitated. There are still moral issues that are raised in the films, but not about this point regarding racial violence.</blockquote>\nOff-topic (my apologies), but I never made that connection! I remember that scene well, because my reaction was "Muh? Why did that add that?". I think you're right about it's intentions - innoculating the film morally by making it clear that orcs were purely "monsters", and not "people" of any sort.<br/><br/>Huh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12601/games-soapboxes" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12601/games-soapboxes" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12601/games-soapboxes/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12601%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12601%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
