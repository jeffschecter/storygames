Will it do something good, something bad, both, neither?  I didn't know.  Actual Play was clearly required!<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW, I tried this in a <i>TSoY</i> session tonight, and it was pretty addictive.  We've already houseruled a resource akin to <i>PTAs</i> FanMail ... little chips that we give each other for cool stuff.  I told people before the game started that I was going to try playing with using them (I had two from last session) as pause markers, rather than bonus dice (as we'd been using them previously).  Folks seemed game, but weren't looking to give up <i>their</i> dice in the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt felt <b>really good</b> to be able to hold up a token and focus people's attention on what just happened.  I was worried that it was going to feel like I was all "Hey!  Look at MEEEEEE!", but it was much more "Whoa ... look at <i>us</i>!"  In both cases (yeah, I spent both, and would have spent more if I'd had them) I did it in a scene where my character was not present.  In both cases, I held the token for a scant ten seconds or so.  What I observed during those ten seconds was that people would, one after the other:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Lean back a little (going from "leaning in over the table" to "leaning back in their chairs")<br/>\n2. Raise their eyes from the mechanics of the table, and look at the faces around them.<br/>\n3. After they had made eye contact with each other, they would refocus on the table, but from the same relaxed posture.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not trying to be an anthropologist about this ... it's just that the details of the behavior were <i>remarkably</i> similar.  There were no people who (for instance) looked at each other while still leaning over the table.  The motions were the same for everyone.  I don't know whether that means anything, but I thought it was funky.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people had returned to an attentive but relaxed posture, I would drop the token and we'd resume.  As I said earlier, this took about ten seconds, both times.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to whether it accomplished anything in the game session ... hard to say.  We had a rockin' session, but I'm quite confident that we also would have done so without this technique in play.  I think it may have helped me personally to be (a) a little more on the lookout for the real stand-out moments in play and (b) a little calmer about letting people make their contributions without trying to kibbitz them.  I'm not terrible at that latter thing, but I do it from time to time, and I could feel that the rate was lower this session than it had been previously.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65392/#Comment_65392" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T22:51:31+00:00" title="April 25, 2007 10:51PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2007 10:53PM by Doyce.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, this sounds really neat.

In play I usually use soundtracks for the games I run. Sometimes during game when something important has just happened or is clearly happening, I'll pause for a moment to shift the soundtrack. <br>\n<br>\nNow, this looks like the usual "soundtrack shuffle" thing that makes a lot of people hate using music in game, but the truth is it isn't. I can change the soundtrack in the game (if playing at my place, at least) without looking or pausing the game. I do it one handed, by touch on the remote and by knowing how many directories are on a disk. So when I don't want it to interrupt the game it doesn't. <br>\n<br>\nWhich means, obviously in retrospect, that when I do it I am pausing on purpose. The pause and the shift in the music together change the tone of the game and the sense of importance around what is happening. The body language thing that you described also often happens, as everyone looks and talks to each other OOCly for a moment while I 'fiddle." And afterwards when we get back in it we get intense again, but the intensity often feels more bonded than it did before the pause. <br>\n<br>\nThe weakness in my technique is obvious. Its magical GM. It relies solely upon my reading of the situation and only I have the ability to do it. (Well, kinda. Sometimes players do request a change, but that happens maybe one time in five to me doing it.) So I really like this idea of yours, as it distributes the authority around the table, gives people clear signs for it, and the currency angle of it both gives people the feeling they have the right to do it and keeps it from being used too lightly. <br>\n<br>\nAwesome. I will now have to make "soundtrack chips" a part of game and see how it works.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
