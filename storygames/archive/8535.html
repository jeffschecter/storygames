Let's talk about it.<br/><br/>This game has an unusually intense focus on the stories of the individual characters. Its concept reads like a Story Game pitch: a number of investigators try to sort out their complicated private lives and preserve their relationships whilst striving to solve the crime fo the (21st) century.

Well, it's mostly a joke. I'll elaborate.<br/><br/>Using good board game elements to enrich story game RPG play is something I've been thinking about a lot lately. Android's pretty interesting in this regard, because it sets up a very story game situation using entirely board game elements. When I play Android, I've got a character with a strong person reason to solve the mystery. I've got some NPC contacts all of whom I want something from; all of whom want something from me. Many of my game play choices involve balancing these pressures against solving the mystery.<br/><br/>And then Android has these bits that aren't Story Gamey at all. For example, there's this conspiracy map where we figure out who's tied to the Big Secret. Even though we map out the conspiracy, there's no attempt or desire to make a story of it. We don't try to explain WHY the mining league is tied to the conspiracy. We just know that I get 4 more victory points as a result.<br/><br/>My opinion of Android is that these two faces of the same game are in conflict. This isn't because they're incompatible, but because of how they're executed in Android. Even though my character has (in theory) a fully realized story played out in their plot cards, just keeping up with that story while balancing the myriad other parts of the game creates a conflict in my experience of play. On top of that, everyone else has their own story, and part of what I do is supply adversity for their stories. But I do this, without having the time and ability to track their stories, or even my input into them, in any but the most peripheral way.  <br/><br/>My take is that Android is a really damn good board game, but that it also tries to be more than a board game and creates some incoherence as a result.<br/><br/>Which leads me to wonder what a board game with similar goals but without that incoherence might look like. And I'm really hoping Eero will comment on that vis-a-vis Zombie Cinema.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189081/#Comment_189081" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T16:17:38+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  4:17PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JuddG</cite>Tony,<br/><br/>It is a step between the channels, so to speak.

Players are not trying to spin a story out of why the city hall wanted the miner dead or something like that - they don't care, they are focused on other things in the game. Compare this to some roleplaying game, which often give you exactly the same sort of creative constraints: in a rpg your detective might find out that the city hall is involved in the murder somehow, and on two different fronts to booth, and then you get to tell the other players why this is so. In the rpg this actually happens because the players are interested in what you say about it. In Android it doesn't, as the story doesn't affect the victory points.<br/><br/>So why have so much story material in a boardgame? My current take is that it presents a secondary split-channel source of entertainment on top of the boardgame, essentially a semi-passive, lonely fun experience that gets semi-randomly assembled out of the cards and components the game is made of. Those players who care can get inspired by the color; often this is the majority of the players, as these games run rather slowly and you'll get bored easily if the color's doing nothing for you.<br/><br/>Where this color-layer gets really ambitious is when the game manages to use the color elements to orient and structure the play experience. This is something that boardgamers tend to expect of all games, really - they'll accuse the game of having a "thin, pasted-on theme" if the game doesn't provide orientation in this manner. To take a really obvious example, consider Arkham Horror: that whole game is made of basically random draws where the only shot at meaning from player viewpoint is in how the random draws have been assorted into color-based structures. Thus, to pick a constant example from the game, the choice of where to set your ability slider at any given point is essentially meaningless because you can't know what you're going to draw as an event. Regardless, the player doesn't experience the choice as meaningless because the fiction is structuring the choice for him. Is my character more of a bookworm or a shooter type? Is he going to go to the library to pore over books, or to the bar to listen for hints? I'd call it false strategy, except that there's no strategy involved in these choices, just playing to the color. The point of the game is to set the story-generator spinning and see what sort of godless monster eats Arkham this time.<br/><br/>Arkham Horror shows us the power of the color layer in boardgames at its extreme, but all popular gamer games use color to aid players in getting into the game, seeing strategic choices and making them while the player's understanding of the game grows. For example, Puerto Rico - the game is easier and more fun to learn because of the theme, and the theme aids the players in making choices even when they don't necessarily know what they're doing. It's very easy to remember where you need or don't need to put slaves, for example, thanks to the color. You also remember where they come from, where to put the extra ones, what happens if you don't have enough... the color elements orient and structure the play experience.<br/><br/>There's a dark side to being theme-focused, too. I've played my share of the Descent: Journeys in the Dark boardgame and gotten largely burned out on it because it's ultimately quite boring and makes sacrifices in playability to maximize color. Setting up the dungeons and miniatures, for instance, isn't worthwhile enough for what the game offers. The same holds for titles such as War of the Ring, Memoir '44 and many other high-color games. In this regard I'm willing to accept that there is a sort of incoherency in these games: the attention to color sometimes detracts from playability for purely logistical reasons (there wasn't any room to make a real game of Arkham Horror after adding it chock-full of story, for instance), which means that the game gets boring after you've gotten used to it and start playing for real. These games tend to lack in staying power, in other words.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>The above is a bit lengthy, but my message is clear: As I understand it, Android and other games like it are not to be interpreted as proto-rpgs like rpg hobbyists tend to do for any and all games that have a dash of story mixed in. It's just a game with the color element turned into an independent source of entertainment from its usual role as an orienteering tool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189089/#Comment_189089" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T19:00:14+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  7:00PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had to go back to the Forge glossary and figure out if I was using incoherency incorrectly.

This is what I was trying to nail down. In Android, it's the experience of being handed this story to explore, but then finding that the story is too intricate to follow in the context of having to play a sophisticated board game with several other people at the same time.<br/><br/>I guess what surprised me in Android is how far they go using color to drive the play experience. Here the experience they're after isn't just "pretend you're a space private eye." It's more like "explore what it is to be balanced on the cusp between light and dark where you're choices can destroy you and all the people you love." It's pretty heady territory for a board game. I can't think of another board game in my experience that does something like that. I frankly thought you couldn't explore human relationships that well in gaming outside of an RPG. I guess I'd have to play Android a few more times and see if it stands up to repetition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189113/#Comment_189113" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T00:10:13+00:00" title="January 20, 2009 12:10AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>As I understand it, Android and other games like it are not to be interpreted as proto-rpgs like rpg hobbyists tend to do for any and all games that have a dash of story mixed in.</blockquote>\nReally?  I've <i>never</i> interpreted these games as proto-rpgs.  I always thinks its really weird when people on BGG or whatnot talk about them that way.<br/><br/>I've never bothered analyzing games this deeply.  I still really like Arkham Horror, and I've played it quite a bit.  On the other hand, though I've only played the once, it <i>seems</i> as though Android might have more significant strategy to its game than AH does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189117/#Comment_189117" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T02:17:12+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  2:17AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to say, if your only use of the slider in Arkham Horror is for colour or roleplaying you're not really using good tactics.  Use of the sliders is far from random, generally we make plans for what characters will be doing over the next couple of turns and adjust sliders to maximise their prospects of success, it's definitely not a false strategy as a poor choice can directly impact play.  There's also meaningful information on which to make that choice.<br/><br/>I've played Arkham a few times now, good strategy generally delivers victory even if you get bad card draws, bad strategy makes it much harder, it's a game with a high random element but the strategy is not part of the colour.<br/><br/>Boardgamers by the way don't all complain of thinly pasted on themes, boardgamers with a preference for Ameritrash games do that but they're only part of the boardgaming hobby.  Euro gamers tend not to have a problem, being more focussed on pure gameplay and often disliking Ameritrash games for having as they see it an excess of theme to the point where it impacts gameplay.  They're just different ways to approach boardgames, with different (though often overlapping of course) fanbases.  But it's quite wrong to say all boardgamers expect colour to orient play structure, many (perhaps most) really don't have that as a requirement.<br/><br/>As for Android, like most Ameritrash games (and those are the kind I most enjoy) it looks (I haven't played it yet) like a really good pairing of mechanics and theme and that's the essence of a good Ameritrash boardgame.  I think that's what's missing from this discussion, that mechanics need to naturally flow from and support theme (in an Ameritrash game, Euro games obviously differ) and people are excited about Android because it appears to do that in new and innovative ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189122/#Comment_189122" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T04:27:21+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  4:27AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was reading the instructions for Last Night on Earth the other day and they are obviously written by someone from a roleplaying background.

There's an interesting thread on boardgamegeeks at the moment discussing rpgs, interesting because about half of those in the thread don't play them so we get to see ourselves as others see us.<br/><br/>A common criticism is time commitment requirements from rpgs, though the dependence on a good GM also seemed to come up a bit IIRC.  Both criticisms are ones that I think many here would sympathise with.  If boardgames can learn from rpgs in how to better integrate theme and mechanics perhaps we should look more at them in how to better illustrate rules through examples and have deep strategy evolve from relatively simple rules (by rpg standards even the most complex boardgames tend to be very simple), and for other lessons too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189126/#Comment_189126" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T04:53:12+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  4:53AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Forgot to ask, how do you find Last Night on Earth?<br/><br/>Zombie survival horror strikes me in some ways as better suited to a good Ameritrash boardgame than it does to an rpg, but that may just be me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189136/#Comment_189136" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T06:42:36+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  6:42AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>Forgot to ask, how do you find Last Night on Earth?<br/><br/>Zombie survival horror strikes me in some ways as better suited to a good Ameritrash boardgame than it does to an rpg, but that may just be me.</blockquote>\nI played it for the first time with Caesar_X yesterday.

There's also a great post from an indie gamer which totally avoids the common (on rpg.net anyway) failing of promoting indie games by complaining of failings in traditional ones - this guy just talks about why he loves the games he does and it's a far more persuasive post for it.

The term was taken up (humorously) by hobbyists who first recognized the different design tendencies and preferred so called "German games" (which was the early nationality-based equivalent for "Euro game"). As for why such a distinction arose - it was likely because the Ameritrash games were and are designed specifically by gamers for gamers (they're essentially distant descendants of wargaming), while Eurogames have an origin in a rather tense marketplace that mixes mainstream market and gamer interests seamlessly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189204/#Comment_189204" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T14:16:17+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  2:16PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            'trash can often be seen suffixed to Euro, so I would imagine it's also a wry callback to that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daw65" title="daw65"><img alt="daw65" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daw65">daw65</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189207/#Comment_189207" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T14:36:02+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  2:36PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All this is to the best of my recollection.<br/><br/>For the longest time, the term German Game was used to denote those games, generally coming out of Germany (though with some exceptions), as Eero described above:  shorter play, less subject to the whims of fortune, less aggressively confrontational, more sedate theming, etc., etc., etc.  Once someone realized that not all these games come from German designers, a quandary arose:  if not "German Games", what then?  The term "Eurogames" had been used (derisively, IIRC) by some in wargaming circles, and the name ended up sticking.<br/><br/>At some point in the past (and please don't ask me to pinpoint it) BoardGameGeek's loudest voices tended to be those who espouse the Eurogame philosophy (and probably they still are).  They tended to look down upon games originating in America.  I always thought that was intended to signify the mass market games:  Monopoly, Clue, Risk, Sorry, etc.  But some folks preferred games with more "theme" , more swings of fate, more, um, adventurous theming, and more direct, in-your-face conflict, which tended to be produced by American companies (most notably, Fantasy Flight Games, but there are others).  Well, these folks got pissed.  A class battle arose, and those who preferred the latter style adopted the derisive term "Ameritrash", taking it as their own as a title of honor.  <br/><br/>I'm fairly sure I'm leaving a bunch of stuff out, but I think that covers the basics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189210/#Comment_189210" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T14:42:26+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  2:42PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2009 2:48PM by Valamir.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ameritrash games generally trend more towards the simulation side of things (the real meaning of simulation, not the wonky GNS abuse of the word).  Arguements over such games might hit on concepts of design for cause vs. design for effect or levels of playability but generally all start from the assumption that the game is attempting (at some level) to model the theme so the decisions in a rail game are the same types of decisions a real rail baron would make, the decisions in a space conquest game are the same types of decisions a real space conquerer would make (modeled at some desired level of detail).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's really fun is when you get boundary challenging games like Memoir '44 where certain Ameritrashers decry because the random cards are just a game prop and don't actually simulate anything while other Ameritrashers (who are less rabid and more willing to be Euro) point out that the cards do effectively simulate a lot of Fog of War effects at a fairly abstract level.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother key difference is that many (though certainly not all) Euro games can often be characterized as multiplayer solitaire where the interaction is more between the player and the game than the players and each other.  The games are typically (though this is less universal than other features) less face-stabby, and when they are face-stabby tend to be so in an indirect way (like how in Puerto Rico you can chose a role for how it hoses another player, but you can't really hose that other player directly.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy contrast most Ameritrash designs pit player vs. player where the main part of the game is to actively try to ruin your opponent's strategy (rolling dice to make my guys kill your guys being the most common example).  Ameri games tend to be much more confrontational and as such also much more prone to gamer diplomacy and negotiations around the table for how best to gang up on someone.<br/>\n<br/>\nEuro gamers will at times refer to Amerigamers as aggressive and hostile and Amerigamers will at time call Eurogamers passive-aggressive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference in design philosophy can really be seen in the games themselves, where game-first (Euro designs) tend to have short punchy rules and play to completion in 2 hours or less.  Theme-first (Ameri- designs) tend to have longer rules, lots more fiddly bits whose purpose is REALLY important to theme but often detracts from actual game play, and only recently have they started making them so they play in as little as 4 hours (6-8 to 10+++++++) being much more traditional for such designs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe parallels between Indie RPGs and their short, punchy, to the point rules and short play times and Trad RPGs with their longer fiddly rules and longer play times I think are far more than mere coincidence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189218/#Comment_189218" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T15:03:32+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  3:03PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, if I'm understanding folks right, we're only beginning to see board games that seek a unity of theme and rules in the same manner as the new wave of indie roleplaying games, yeah?

And yet I tend to be most interested in indie rpgs and ameritrash boardgames...  I think one of the key reasons behind this is the interaction aspect.  It's not necessarily that I want to get all face stabby (one of my favorite ameritrash games is Arkham Horror, after all), but sometimes I'll hear people talking about how cool some Euro is (Race for the Galaxy and Dominion being recent examples) and I'll think "I ought to check that out!" but then when I read reviews I see that, while people may love them, they're described as having very little (or extremely subtle) direct player interaction and then I think, "Ehhh, there's no hurry.  I'll pass for now."  RPGs in general, on the other hand, and indie games in particular, tend to have a huge focus on player interaction.  not to D&amp;D bash, but I've played in sessions of that archetypal example of "The Traditional RPG" in which the players only ever talked to the DM to tell him they were attacking or picking a lock or casting some spell, and never really talked to each at all.<br><br>So... I'm not sure the parallels are as clear cut as all that, Ralph.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189221/#Comment_189221" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T15:09:46+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  3:09PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>So, if I'm understanding folks right, we're only beginning to see board games that seek a unity of theme and rules in the same manner as the new wave of indie roleplaying games, yeah?

Take your pick of any old Avalon Hill or SPI title.  What we're starting to see know is some nod towards the idea of streamlining and making the mechanics punchier as a nod towards the popularity of the Euro Games (which better fit into most gamers schedules).<br/>\n<br/>\nAndroid is a great example of this but I think it falls short of the ambitious goal (or should I say "potential" as I don't know what the actual design goal was).  Its still too fiddly and clunky to really allow the roleplaying immersive aspects to rise sufficiently to the surface to be the first to accomplish a solid RPG board hybrid.  GMT games suffer from this alot...they try and try but they just don't GET what makes Euro mechanics successful and they can't completely fight the urge to overly complicate things...its like their core simulation urges overpower their attempt to design more modern games so their latest batch of games wind up falling short on both accounts.  But I give them A for effort.  There's a good number of Old Dogs over their trying to learn new tricks...something we can relate to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189275/#Comment_189275" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T19:41:55+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  7:41PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can someone break down Candyland for me?<br><br>Eurogame or Ameritrash?<br><br>(I don't want this because it'll clarify terms, I just want it for amusement)                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189280/#Comment_189280" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T21:37:04+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  9:37PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Can someone break down Candyland for me?</blockquote>I can't.<br><a href="http://playthisthing.com/candy-land" rel="nofollow">But Greg Costikyan can.</a> </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189300/#Comment_189300" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T02:29:48+00:00" title="January 21, 2009  2:29AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think parallels between boardgames and rpgs of the Euro/Ameritrash - Indie/Trad are deeply misleading in all honesty.

The Ameritrash games seeped in theme, but don't just end up relying on a bunch of die rolls or "cheap laughs that get old quickly", and the Eurotrash games that adopt a theme and stick with it without it being simple window dressing for some Complete Other Game.<br/><br/>Anyway, my classic examples for Ameritrash vs Eurotrash games can be seen in Steve Jackson's board games vs Reiner Knizia's games.<br/><br/>I'll be blunt: Frag and Chez Geek are crappy games, but they're seeped in theme.<br/>Chez Geek has a great theme, but the game is totally broken and funny Once. There are several unusable cards that were created because They Belonged with the Theme, but their effects simply did not work because they were broken (I'm trying to remember my big example from back when; I think one was called "Block Party!" which enhanced the effect of "All X Cards In Play"... but there was only One Other X Card in the game. It's like they were meaning to make MORE, but forgot. That doesn't happen much in Eurotrash games.<br/>Frag is a fucking boring die-rolling slagpile. You appear, you roll to move, you roll to shoot, you roll to dodge, you roll for damage, you roll to soak, and you do it again, and again, and again. The luck is totally wild and devoid of any real strategy, and just the sheer weight of the rolls... it was like in development, nobody really played it more than once; because the rolling becomes fucking tedium defined after that. BUT, the game is seeped in theme. The cards, background and all are all totally soaked in the FPS trappings. But the rules suck; they're plain unimaginitive and chaotically random.<br/><br/>Contrast that to Reiner Knizia, pretty much the King of Eurotrash games: His games are all mechanics, with theme as like an afterthoughts. Like, "Oh, yeah, I better do something with this game, cause right now it's a white board with marker-lines, cards with a few letters and numbers, and plain white tiles with abstract symbols and meanins."<br/><br/>The example from his pile that I like is his game "<a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3" rel="nofollow">Samurai</a>". The game has Jack and Shit to do with samurai and Japan. Instead, it's a tile-laying resource manuvering strategy game, where the board just happens to look like a map of part of Japan rather than "a white log". There is no conquest, no honor, no swords, no nothing. Just a few tiles with names like "The Temple". It could have just as easily been Mario conquering the Mushroom Kingdom by planting Radishes and Bob-Omb and shit. The theme was so transparently tacked on that it's almost painful; like I'd rather it have been simply grey tiles on a marker-drawn board (yeah, I was suckered into getting it because of the stories I heard about this "awesome samurai-themed game").<br/><br/>Now, those are extreme examples of each end of the spectrum between "Classic Ameritrash" ("Grab a theme, and just roll a bunch of dice! It's lots of fun... once!") and "Classic Eurotrash" ("These mechanics make this the most intense game of tile-laying, resource management, harvesting and trade balancing... Oh, shit, I forgot a theme... Just find a graphic designer to make it look like Star Trek/Prehistoric America/Ancient China/France in the 1930s and we can get it in stores!"). Most games don't tend to those extremes, of course... and THOSE are the games that I personally like. Memoir 44 is one that was brandied about before. From what I read, Battlestar Galactica is this as well, it's not just squeezing money but wrapping a theme around a shitty/unreflective rules model. On the other side, games like Traders of Genoa and Puerto Rico definitely have more of a lock on their theme. <br/><br/>Every once in a while, though, one of those games on the far end of the spectrum fall out on the market, and only the people that reside in one camp or the other can really enjoy it. I find most folks tend to be able to straddle both worlds pretty easily, again as long as the Rules are Good and the Theme Actually Means Something.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189327/#Comment_189327" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T08:42:14+00:00" title="January 21, 2009  8:42AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>From what I read, Battlestar Galactica is this as well, it's not just squeezing money but wrapping a theme around a shitty/unreflective rules model.</blockquote>???

That and I'm unpersuaded that Eurogames show more thought about mechanics than the major Ameritrash ones.  They show different thought, but not less thought.  Games like Arkham Horror or Game of Thrones aren't produced by people who're not thinking very deeply indeed about mechanics, indeed I would go so far as to say no major boardgame (possibly excepting those with mass public appeal) has been successful that hasn't had deep thought about its mechanics.

Compared to something like Republic of Rome, I can see influence.  <br/><br/>I differ on how Euro GoT is, but that's not really material to the thread.<br/><br/>On 4e, absolutely, hugely indie influenced, but I wouldn't exactly call it evidence of a trend to simplicity.<br/><br/>Edit:  To clarify, we're disagreeing on slightly different points.  I'm not trying to argue against influence, I'd be amazed were there not, I'm arguing against a trend to simpler and punchier games because I don't think that exists and I'm arguing against the idea that thinking stuff through is a Eurogame contribution as I don't really think that's right.  I think there's a much better case in rpgs that Indie games thought stuff through from the ground up while trad games did stuff as it always had been than there is for Euro and Ameritrash games.  Again, I just don't think the parallels hold.  I don't think Eurogames and Indie rpgs have any meaningful equivalence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189353/#Comment_189353" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T09:49:17+00:00" title="January 21, 2009  9:49AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2009 9:51AM by komradebob.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>This is your issue of the moment isn't it? </blockquote>\nHeh.

I play boardgames about once a month, if we miss a month, no biggie.  If someone can't make it, no biggie.  If numbers vary, it affects what we play but no biggie.  <br/><br/>I play rpgs once every week.  If we miss a week, it disrupts continuity as memories fade of what last happened.  If someone can't make it, it disrupts continuity.  If numbers vary, it's a pain.<br/><br/>Rpgs are just much harder work in terms of ongoing commitment.  Well, most rpgs anyway.  There are others here better qualified than I am to talk about indie rpgs to which none of this applies.  However, I don't think indie rpgs will ever see any meaningful commercial success, and I don't think the current rpg paradigm is likely to be successfully challenged (4e sure doesn't).  As such, I see boardgames as more viable long term than rpgs.  Boardgame companies can sell to an existing base which is simply less prone to shrinkage, as it's much easier to stay in the hobby.  It's also easier to recruit, most folk know what a boardgame is, a different style of one is a sell but not a really hard sell.  RPGs don't have that benefit.<br/><br/>There's more, or expanded detail anyway, but that's the essence.  Boardgames, even complex ones, are more accessible than rpgs and require less commitment.<br/><br/>Edit:  And I agree with your second para on multiple causes, thanks for the reminder.

I always thought that was intended to signify the mass market games:  Monopoly, Clue, Risk, Sorry, etc.</blockquote>\nWell, you know... Clue (originally Cluedo) was designed by Anthony E. Pratt, and originally published by Waddingtons, a British company; Risk was designed by Albert Lamorisse, and originally published in France as "La Conquete du Monde." Sorry is a variant of the classic Indian game Pachisi. Of that list, only Monopoly is genuinely American in origin.<br/><br/>Thanks for the link to my rant about Candyland, fnord3125.  It's American in origin, certainly, though it's what Dave Parlett calls a "theme game" -- no real connection between subject and gameplay. In other words, it predates the class of games that Eurosnobs call Ameritrash -- I don't like the term myself, but "Ameritrash" games really originate in the simulationist impulse of hobby games from Avalon Hill, SPI, and others, and would logically include any number of games of British origin, like History of the World, Civilization (boardgame, not computer), 1830, etc. These games are typically more complicated than Eurogames, take longer to play, and don't have mechanics that are as polished -- but do something to explicate the nature of the subject of the game. In other words, whether you prefer one style or the other is purely a matter of aesthetics. For my part, I like both, but regret that so many excellent games from the older US market are no longer in print.<br/><br/>In any event, to see a sold, unbroken border between the two traditions is quite suspect; the German game market was strongly influenced by Sid Sackson, a US designer of the older abstract game tradition; Alan Moon, also of the US and a former Avalon Hill employee, has had great success in the German market; and many recent US games (like, say, Pandemic) have obviously been strongly influenced by Eurogames. There's a back-and-forth here, and while you can certainly point to aesthetic differences, it's not like American and European game designers are working in isolated silos.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189383/#Comment_189383" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T11:11:34+00:00" title="January 21, 2009 11:11AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2009 11:14AM by Valamir.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Ralph, I wasn't disagreeing about influence, I cited Arkham and Game as examples where mechanics have been thought about deeply not as ones that bore no Eurogame influence.

Arkham and GoT are great examples where mechanics have been thought about deeply*...precisely because they've been heavily influenced by Euro designs.  They are the examples of American Designed games being influenced by Euro thinking just as 4E is an example of a Traditional Game influenced by indie thinking.  Do you really think that Game of Thrones would look like that if it had been written in 1980?  Look at the old Lord of the Rings board game for what a fantasy novel-to-board-game adaptation looked like back in the day and tell me that GoT isn't far more on the Euro side of design than the American side of design.<br/>\n<br/>\n(and as for punchier rules and quicker play, if you don't think 4E plays a ton quicker and punchier than 3E or 2E ever did, we've been playing vastly different games).<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to be clear here because the examples you are using are all pretty recent.  The term Ameritrash was coined in just the last few years to identify a design tradition that was distinct from Euro Games.  But that design tradition goes back to the 60s.  Don't just compare recent games that have been labeled "Ameritrash" to Eurogames and try to see the differences...because the recent games have moved dramatically closer to their Euro cousins.  Compare old 3M games, old SPI games, old Avalon Hill games to Euro Games...then you'll see how heavily Game of Thrones has been Euroified.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'll also see really really interesting examples like Acquire...which quite possibly was the world's first "Euro" even though it was (AFaIK) an American Design.  And games like History of the World and Brittania which show that some American Designers were thinking along the same direction as later Euro Designers in terms of abstracting the theme, though not nearly so radically...which is a key reason why all three of those games have been rereleased in recent years, because despite their age they bear greater resemblance to games of today than their chronological peers do.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at GMT's remake of Blackbeard...a game which was an intentional attempt by a Old School American Designer to bring Euro sensibilities to that old title.  Look at GMT's Winds of Plunder, which is pretty much an American designed Euro, or Conquest of Paradise which is pretty much an effective hybrid of the two philosophies.  Then look at the average play time for these games and compare that to Civilization or Diplomacy or King Maker and tell me the trend isn't towards quicker playing games.  Yes, Fantasy Flight is still putting out some longer play games like Star Craft...but even the games that we consider "Long play" games today would be considered "Normal length" games in 1985.  MOST board games I played (other than parker brothers family games) back in 1985 were 6-8 hours long.  Just try to play Advanced Civilization with 6 players in under 6 hours.  Today if a game goes 4 hours people start compaining about the length.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*for the record, I chose this phraseology to mirror Max's for clarity.  I am not making the claim that pre Euro American designers didn't think deeply.  I am making the claim that they thought deeply about very different things.<br/>\n<br/>\n** I'll also note that the term American and Euro are here being used to identify design philosophy, not necessarily country of Origin...much like "Modernist" Art isn't very modern.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daw65" title="daw65"><img alt="daw65" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daw65">daw65</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189391/#Comment_189391" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T11:50:59+00:00" title="January 21, 2009 11:50AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: costik</cite><br>Well, you know...

I guess I haven't actually seen it dismissed/insulted on an RPG website, but I'm guessing it has been, by saying that "It's really just a board game."  personally, I don't really play it as an RPG myself, but one certainly could.  I just think it's funny that people seem to zoom in on the aspect of it that turns them off and throw it into that category.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8535/whats-the-fuss-about-android" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8535/whats-the-fuss-about-android" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8535/whats-the-fuss-about-android/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F8535%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F8535%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
