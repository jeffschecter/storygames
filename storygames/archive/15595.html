It is a game about writing bad sci fi movies.<br/><br/>In the game the players are writers for the "B Movie" Channel. They are locked in a room and told to write. Quality in not important! To stay sane, the writers turned it into a game. One player throws a toke into the pot and starts the scene. The next player adds a token to the pot and adds to the scene. With each new addition the chance the last writer has to win goes down. Eventually someone calls.<br/><br/>This makes JTS a game of chicken because after the call, the next player can steal the call for two tokens, the next for three tokens, etc. Only the last writer and caller can win the pot. <br/><br/>The players run through five scenes so games don't take long. Story cards guide the players through scenes so each game produces a complete movie. It's all good light fun.<br/><br/>The game includes five story cards:<br/><br/>Surf Zombies<br/>Dead Tide (complete with a zombie shark!)<br/>Return to Planet X<br/>Pirates Ho (adult oriented)<br/>and<br/>Curse of the SS<br/><br/>Look for a little box in you local game store with a couple of waterskiers going by a lounging Hollywood Shark. Should sell for around $19.99.<br/><br/>Chris Engle<br/>Hamster Press<br/>hamsterpress@gmail.com                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
