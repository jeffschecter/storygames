I'd had a lot of interest on RPGGeek, so I pushed it up the production schedule, built a system and had the chance to run it last Saturday when a newcomer to the meetup group chose it out of the three remaining games on offer (we operate a newbie's choice policy where we try to make their choice of game happen). I have to say, all credit to the members of the London Indie RPG Meetup Group - they're always very willing to try out new games. <br/><br/>I'd constructed a GM-led task-based system with peer voting for resolution, which everyone absolutely hated, although they loved the premise, which is that notable scientists from the late C20 have for some reason been uprooted from their home environment and are now sharing a dingy tenement building in North London, where they have to mix it with ordinary people, doing ordinary everyday things while at the same time wrestling with the great questions of the day.<br/><br/>Most of the players were reasonably happy with doing tasks, however one wasn't happy with them being GM-led, and my saying the tone was light comedic meant that they ended up erring towards the one-dimensional caricature. Thus, my exploratory initial task - rescuing a neighbour's cat from a tree - had Tesla fiddling with plugs and wires trying to shock the cat out of the tree; Freud took the tree itself to be a metaphor for... you know, and Heisenberg (who was an outdoorsy type) simply shinned up the tree and hoiked down the cat but then expressed uncertainty as to whether the cat was really there or not. <br/><br/>I still think a task-based system would be viable (my original idea was for something along the lines of <i>InSpectres</i>), but while the players were roleplaying I realised that even that would be to reduce the characters to mere cyphers; why have famous name scientists only to have them just doing mundane tasks? So I think I'll probably switch to full-on storygame mode and rig up a system along similar lines to my game <i>Where The Heart Is</i>, where they both interact with each other and engage in social activities with external NPCs (landlords, neighbours, public officials etc.) against a framework of individual goals, a meta-game objective (integrate successfully into their new environment) and a session by session theme (prepare for a soiree organised by the Royal Institution, say).                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448891/#Comment_448891" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-06T13:06:37+00:00" title="October  6, 2015  1:06PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So it's a 20th Century Big Bang Theory?

Kind of, yeah. I think you could run a TBBT session based off it; it\u2019s the obvious choice. As you may not have seen my earlier posts on the subject, here are the current drafts. I\u2019d be interested to get your opinion about the voting process. The main problem the playtesters had with it was the giving of minus votes; it\u2019s possible that they and other players would have felt comfortable with distributing tokens rather than valences. <br/><br/>One idea I had for re-integrating the tokens into the game, based on something one of the players came up with, is as a representation of the black and white dice in Fiasco, so that at the end of the session the players each have either a bad or good ending according to the number of black and white dice held after the tilt. Anyway, just a thought.<br/><br/><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44973653/Great%20Minds%20(cover).pdf" rel="nofollow">Cover</a><br/><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44973653/Great%20Minds%20(insides).pdf" rel="nofollow">Insdes</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448909/#Comment_448909" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-07T08:37:11+00:00" title="October  7, 2015  8:37AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I'm a bit uncomfortable with players judging each others' performances. This is called "poodle points" in Swedish RPG terminology and I'm not too fond of it. Especially in this version, since it's competitive, it seems to me to break the "Rising principle of gameiness", which says that the best way of playing should be the most fun. In this game, it seems that the best way of playing (i.e. playing to win) would be to cast your votes depending on which player is a bigger threat, ignoring their performance completely. But playing this way would be no fun and probably break the game.<br/><br/>I like the concept of the game, but I'd prefer it to play out more like Keep it Sunny. But that's not a competitive game, so probably not quite the sort of thing you're after.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448911/#Comment_448911" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-07T13:43:14+00:00" title="October  7, 2015  1:43PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2015 2:10PM by catty_big.">edited October 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, that's all I need to completely abandon the idea of voting.
