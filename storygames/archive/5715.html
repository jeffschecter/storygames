(Since I plan to snap up the first job that anyone dangles in front of me, I'll probably be working crazy unpredictable hours until I find something more permanent.) Therefore, the game has to be <i>way</i> more two-player friendly than, say, D&amp;D. Niche protection is fine, "if you don't have a healer in the party, you're screwed!" isn't.<br/><br/>* Kym's a scientist (and an actual, full-time <i>paid</i> one as of a couple weeks ago!) with a sharp analytical mind. Therefore, I want a little bit of system mastery involved; of the "ooh, if I take Feat X in combination with Feat Y, I'll totally kick ass at Task Z!" variety, rather than the "if I foolishly take this cool sounding feat that intense statistical analysis reveals actually does the complete opposite of what it says it does, my character will suck for all time and all the other System Masters on the internet will laugh at me!" A reasonable number of clearly written feats seems about right for that.<br/><br/>* She's also very creative and is <i>damned good</i> coming up with interesting character concepts (in a "writing" context, not just a "gaming" context). I'd <i>like</i> those concepts to have mechanical impact, so ideally I want to work in some kind of freeform traits (i.e., Aspects) without them either detracting from or being overshadowed by the crunchier predetermined feats. This, however, is pretty far down my list of priorities.<br/><br/>* Finally, I have this idea for a framework to wrap around the game where the players "buy" scenes that advance them toward their goals and the GM "buys" challenges to put into those scenes--basically a large-scale cooperative story creation engine that distributes the "what do these random ogres have to do with our search for the Mystical MacGuffin?" questions among the whole group, freeing the GM to play hard at the individual encounter level. That's also something that's very low on my list of priorities right now. If I ever do get around to writing it, I want it to have minimal contact with the "characters doing stuff" rules so it'll be easier to port it over to other rulesets.<br/><br/>So, to that end, here's what's going on in my system:<br/><br/>* 2d6+X vs target Y. (Sound familiar?) Boxcars rock, snakeeyes suck, any other doubles add complications to your success or failure -- who decides what the complication is is up to the group -- if you like surprises, leave the complications up to the GM, if you like screwing over your own characters, make them up yourself.<br/><br/>* Since not every action necessarily has an interesting complication that could result from it, each character has a generic Trouble stat that can be increased through complications. The GM can spring complications on a character at any time by buying down that character's Trouble. (This will also be the point of contact with the larger story economy framework, but I think it's a fun mechanic even without it.)<br/><br/>* Feats (or talents, or whatever I get around to naming them) organized into trees. (Sound familiar?)<br/><br/>* Some feats give you Bonus Dice in certain situation, where you roll three or more dice and take the best two. This increases your chances of success, but it <i>also</i> greatly increases your chance of complications. My rationale: risk is fun, but only ever risking <i>failure</i> is boring. Bonus dice let you get what you want but still risk interesting consequences.<br/><br/>* Raising the Stakes is in there, but abstracted. Again, both Kym and I like surprises, so saying "here's what happens if I succeed, and here's what happens if I fail" is Not Fun for us. Instead, players can wager better results vs. incurring more points of Trouble.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127775/#Comment_127775" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T14:46:37+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  2:46PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2008 2:47PM by Ry.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So far we're on the same wavelength, I think.

The players do all the rolling here, right?  That's a big one for me.</blockquote>\nPlayers Roll All The Dice is an idea I've never cared for, because I mostly GM and I <i>like</i> rolling dice. \n<blockquote>I like the idea with the doubles, but if I roll 3 dice, 6, 5, 5, is that doubles or not?  I'd say not.</blockquote>\nI keep going back and forth on that one and I've finally decided that, yes, all the dice count toward the possibility of doubles. <br/><br/>Originally I was thinking that you'd have lots of different ways to add bonus dice to a roll, so that you might end up taking the best two of a whole pile of dice. In that case, I'd only count the best two dice toward doubles. I was also going to use penalty dice as well, which would take away bonus dice or, if you had more penalties than bonuses, involve adding up the <i>lowest</i> of several dice.<br/><br/>But then I decided that I didn't <i>want</i> players rolling huge piles of dice because that took away from the simplicity of 2d6. I didn't want every roll turning into a D&amp;D 3.x-style modifier fest with bonus and penalty dice taking the place of +/- 2's. <br/><br/>So, penalty dice are gone, and bonus dice are capped at one: you'll always add the highest two of either two or three dice.<br/><br/>Because of that, I want a bonus die roll to be A Big Deal, with bigger risks for bigger rewards. Counting all three dice towards doubles makes a complication (as far as I can tell) twice is likely. What I <i>haven't</i> settled on yet what the bigger reward should be. (Some kind of feat-specific "if you succeed on a bonus roll <i>this</i> happens"? A generic "any time you succeed on a bonus roll you get to inject an additional fact into the narrative"? Something else altogether?)\n<blockquote>Also, Oracles.  Oracles?</blockquote>\nSell me on Oracles. I don't have IAWA, so I don't know enough about them. As far as I can tell, they're just a table of inspirational story elements that you pick from randomly, right? Not that that's not cool, but how does they differ from, like, the "101 Adventure Seeds" or whatever that we've seen in other games? Do they interact directly with the game mechanics somehow?
