It's more dangerous if he's stumbling drunk and mad.<br/><br/>A player wants to disarm him of his weapon. What happens next?<br/><br/>Is it hard to disarm someone whose motor reflexes are significantly impaired by alcohol? I don't know the "real life" answer, but let us consider the fictitious RPG answer: it's a damn sight easier to disarm someone three sheets to the wind than it is when he's sober.<br/><br/>There are a handful of ways one could address this situation.<br/><br/>One. Adjust the difficulty based on the various situational modifiers. The difficulty is reduced by X because he's drunk, but it's increased by Y because you're going to have to move fast to disarm him before he shoots.<br/><br/>Two. Adjust the consequences. He's got a gun. If you fail this roll, you're going to get shot. On a hit / partial success, the gun is going off, but you take reduced damage.<br/><br/>Three. A third way, so to speak, calculating both danger and difficulty separately. I am uncertain if this is even worthwhile, but let us suppose it is for a moment. The fictional position of the "disarming drunk" is dangerous because of the position possessed by the two characters: a man with a gun against an unarmed character. (One could argue that the fictional position is ultimately less dangerous due to inebriation, but again, bear with me for the purpose of the thought experiment.) However, due to intoxication, the overall difficulty of the task is easy.<br/><br/>Two axes are thus present: intent (disarm) and position (potential for taking a bullet). This offers four potential outcomes:<br/><br/>1. Intent success / position success: disarm opponent, do not get shot.<br/>2. Intent success / position failure: disarm opponent, get shot.<br/>3. Intent failure / position success: drunk keeps his gun, but you don't get shot.<br/>4. Intent failure /position failure: drunk keeps gun, you get shot.<br/><br/>Of these outcomes, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> is the least desirable if only because the situation remains relatively static. There are certainly things that could occur (gun goes off, causing a panic), but for most GMs, the situation is that the player is going to roll again.<br/><br/>In the case of the drunk with a gun, the situation could be phrased in the following consequences:<br/><br/>1. Intent failure.<br/>2. Suffering harm as established.<br/><br/>In a high risk scenario, harm as established could be diminished through success, but rarely negated. Example: on a good roll, you suffer 2-harm, whereas a weak roll inflicts 4-harm.<br/><br/>To reiterate myself, variable difficulty allows for manipulation easy intent success while fictional positioning allows for difficult-to-mitigate consequences (and vice-versa).<br/><br/>My question is thus: is this desirable?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464310/#Comment_464310" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-26T02:28:37+00:00" title="June 26, 2017  2:28AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure.

Is a game of changing probabilities really that interesting?<br/><br/>Btw, this is a bit of an aside, but just b/c 5e has rules for dealing with drunk people (they get disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks), here's how 5e would handle it. ("Disarm" is from DMG page 271.)<br/><br/>RAW:<br/>1 Roll initiative. Drunk gets disadvantage on rolling initiative. In the example, let's say they go first anyway (capricious dice!):<br/>2 Drunk shoots at you. They roll, with disadvantage, an attack roll vs your AC<br/>3 You try to disarm them. Contested roll: you make an attack roll, they make an "athlobatics" (highest of athletics or acrobatics) check (they roll with disadvantage).<br/><br/><small>Ugh I have too many house rules, b/c three of them are involved even in a short example like this:<br/>1 Initiative system du jour, never happy with it and always changing it<br/>2 They point their gun at you and stress you out. Make a defense roll with advantage.<br/>3 You try to disarm them, make an attack roll vs their disadvantaged passive "athlobatics" (to take the disadvantaged passive is to assume they rolled a five, and not roll for the NPC).</small><br/><br/>So, a lot of probs changing b/c the drunkenness\u2026 but, more rules to look up or remember. <small>(to be fair to 5e, so much is emergent from so little, which I love. The condition list pulls so much weight.)</small><br/><br/>In a game like AW 1e, you seize it by force (\u2026or, that makes sense to me\u2026? you're after the gun, there's a risk of getting shot etc) and the drunkenness might affect the outcome but not the probabilities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464322/#Comment_464322" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-26T15:46:05+00:00" title="June 26, 2017  3:46PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2017 3:53PM by ValyrianSteelKatana.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The primary reason to have variable probabilities is to allow for vertical advancement. One might argue that this is unnecessary, but character progression is important for game longevity, in my experience. It also allows for characters to encounter challenges that are easily overcome - an "easy win" as a reward for their hardships.<br/><br/>Again, one can easily argue that the commoner with a pitchfork vs. an orc chieftain can be handled fictionally, but that is less satisfying in many respects because, as with D&amp;D 5e, it relies on a high degree of GM cooperation. People who denigrate the OSR refer to this as "Mother May I" gameplay and "playing the GM."<br/><br/>That root problem is one of those things that cannot be solved mechanically (getting everyone on the same page fictionally), but sometimes it's easier just to plop down a statblock and say "this guy has AC 10 and does 1d4 damage, the orc has AC 14 and does 1d10 damage" - if I'm conveying my sentiments properly.<br/><br/>Aside: <br/><br/>In the above scenario in 5e, I would probably handle it more narratively, if only because I do not feel the need to break out the combat rules unless we're running into a situation where the tactical nature of the rules is important. (If death is on the table, the rules are important, so for a level 1 character, yes, for a level 10 character, not so much.)<br/><br/>For a high level character, I'd likely set an "Athlobatics" DC (a good term) that is appropriate, and say:<br/><br/>1. You hit the DC, you get the gun, but it's going to go off and you're going to take damage.<br/>2. You hit the DC by +5, you get the gun and wrestle it from him before it goes off.<br/>3. You miss and you get shot.<br/><br/>That may be unsatisfying for some players, but it allows for a fairly expedient resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464337/#Comment_464337" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-26T20:41:11+00:00" title="June 26, 2017  8:41PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Yeah, good points.</p>\n<p>Three OT asides:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the reason I always mess with the initiative system is to try to remove it, so that it\u2019s not breaking out the combat system to just resolve a quick attack or two.</li>\n<li>I\u2019ve noticed that in official 5e rules, whenever you use athletics or acrobatics <em>defensively</em>, it\u2019s almost always your choice (i.e. \u201cathlobatics\u201d), when you use it offensively, it\u2019s almost never your choice.

I can enjoy simple pass/fail in the right game, but if we're positing a game that wants more from its rules than that, then I'd say your proposal is a solid example.<br/><br/>One problem, though: in <i>my</i> interpretation "and don't get shot" is an implied part of the intent: "disarm".  No one will ever announce the action "I wish to disarm him regardless of the odds of my getting killed in the process".  So in order to wind up with the fictional/mechanical example you used, we'd need a very robust procedure for parsing the fiction and sorting it into those categories.<br/><br/>I might prefer to measure the consequences of fictional positioning as a subset of succeeding at one's intent, and separately as a subset of failing at one's intent.  Then use more developed intents than "disarm".  Thus, if I'm rolling to achieve my intent, I can't get shot on a successful roll.  But I can on an unsuccessful roll, and there are all sorts of other things that can go wrong on a successful roll.  "I intend that everything goes perfectly for me" would either not be an option (player forced to choose among competing priorities, with the lower ones not covered) or it'd render your odds terrible.<br/><br/>As a player, I might really enjoy the choice in how to set my own odds -- better chance of partial success, or smaller chance of perfect success.  (It might actually be really fun in a system with a wide range of skill levels to really milk your overmatches -- dropping your 140% chance of success to 100% chance of getting your perfect outcome or some such.)<br/><br/>Before I keep doing design brainstorming in your thread, <a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">@ValyrianSteelKatana</a> , I'll pause and see if you think this line of thought is worth continuing here.  <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464575/#Comment_464575" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-03T15:02:00+00:00" title="July  3, 2017  3:02PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2017 5:08PM by ValyrianSteelKatana.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Go for it.<br/><br/>I myself have been thinking about this particular issue some more, and I like the idea, but there is an inherent difficulty with regard to granularity. Jockeying for fictional position while also dealing with intent and consequences produces a system that is very much suitable for overall conflict resolution but somewhat poor for dealing with a close narrative lens. Or at least this is after running my thought experiments on the matter. Any scene in which multiple actors are maneuvering the fiction can become burdensome, and individual task resolution becomes cumbersome.<br/><br/>I have been considering how one can handle fictional positioning in the traditional RPG framework. What happens when the dragon breathes fire at the party? In D&amp;D, of course, all the characters roll their saving throws; those who succeed suffer half damage, and those who fail suffer full damage.<br/><br/>Applying this principle to fictional positioning...<br/><br/>Let us say that the dragon breathes fire against the party. What happens? Save-for-half is the result of the worst fictional position, one can say, because even a successful saving throw renders the expenditure of resources (and may kill a PC). Full damave vs. half damage is two outcomes, and by logical extension, there exists a third outcome, in which the PCs take no damage. (This third outcome already exists by avoiding the dragon's ire, but such is not enshrined in the rules.)<br/><br/>Three outcomes:<br/><br/>1. Full damage.<br/>2. Half damage.<br/>3. No damage.<br/><br/>But even this mechanical setup can itself be seen as a framing of a weak fictional positioning because the best outcome is only "you don't end up weaker than you started." In some ways, that may even be desired, because if you rouse a dragon to anger, it is good enough to maintain your health.<br/><br/>A rambling digression here: regarding the granularity of the saving throw, full / half / none is easy enough to remember as three potential outcomes, yet further breakdown could be done. What if, for example, there were four outcomes?<br/><br/>1. 3/3 damage.<br/>2. 2/3 damage.<br/>3. 1/3 damage.<br/>4. No damage.<br/><br/>This could be divided further and further up until the point where we measure the damage in tenths or hundredths or thousandths, but that seems overly granular. As I said, a digression, but somewhat pertinent.<br/><br/>Returning to the three outcomes, there really ought to be a fourth: the critical success, as it were. One can imagine this as the "+1 forward," the gaining of a situational advantage. Such seems unlikely in the case of dragonfire, doesn't it? And mechanically, it is a bit suspect, I suppose, that the dragon's deadly flame somehow opens the dragon up for retaliation...but for the sake of argument, let us suppose it exists.<br/><br/>Thus:<br/><br/>1. Full damage.<br/>2. Half damage.<br/>3. No damage.<br/>4. Situational advantage.<br/><br/>This allows a convenient breakdown of fictional positions.<br/><br/>Worst position: full / half damage.<br/><br/>Middlemost position: half / no damage.<br/><br/>Best position: no damage / advantage.<br/><br/>However, that renders us with scenarios undesirable. The best position carries no risk and all reward. That itself might be considered a benefit for canny players who can manipulate the fictional positioning, but it's not particular exiting. Where's the drama? The danger?<br/><br/>Fictional positioning revised:<br/><br/>Weak position: Full / half / none.<br/><br/>Strong position: Half / none / advantage.<br/><br/>Binary fictional positioning? Nothing in the middle? Hum. Uncertain how I feel about that. Returning to granular saving throw outcomes...<br/><br/>1. Full damage + the character is on fire.<br/>2. Half damage, but the character is on fire.<br/>3. Half damage, and the character is not on fire.<br/>4. No damage.<br/>5. Advantage.<br/><br/>Fictional positioning revised, <i>revised</i>:<br/><br/>Weak: Full + fire / half + fire / half.<br/>Middle: Half + fire / half / none.<br/>Strong: Half / none / advantage.<br/><br/>Yet all of this seems almost laughably extraneous the more I think about it. An overload of granularity and excessive complexity. Return to the initial three outcomes and translate them to PbtA:<br/><br/>6-. Full damage.<br/>7-9. Half damage.<br/>10+. No damage.<br/><br/>And one could simply assign a +1 or -1 to the roll depending on fictional positioning. So much needless complexity...<br/><br/>But I'm not done with this idea yet.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464576/#Comment_464576" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-03T19:43:24+00:00" title="July  3, 2017  7:43PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2017 8:28PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the coolest part of your idea is the interesting resolution outputs -- like gaining advantage while dodging dragon fire -- and not the inputs (best position / strong position / etc.).  I'm inclined to settle on whatever inputs will best help us get the outputs we want.  So, focusing on the outcomes:<br/><br/>Let's say we divide up all the risks characters face, all the bad things that might happen to them, into a few basic categories.  How about AW's MC Hard Moves for starters:<br/>- Separated from allies.<br/>- Captured (I'll add Trapped and Pinned).<br/>- Injured.<br/>- Lose possessions.<br/>- Lose resources.<br/>- Action turns back on them.<br/>- Enemy able to do special action.<br/>- Belongings' downsides manifest.<br/>- "Put in a spot," which I'll elaborate into Prone, Disoriented (Stunned, Blind, etc.), Surrounded, Outnumbered, and Facing a dilemma.<br/><br/>For each instance of resolution, if we could assess which of these are apparent risks, and establish what the acting character is doing to mitigate them, then perhaps we'd be in good shape to generate those interesting outcomes you're pursuing.<br/><br/>Facing a blast of fire, I can instantly envision these in play:<br/>- Injured.<br/>- Lose possessions.<br/>- Enemy able to do special action.<br/>- Prone.<br/>- Disoriented.<br/><br/>Playing my character, maybe my priority is to avoid getting myself into an even worse position, where a flying leap leaves me prone or disoriented or set up for the dragon's next attack.  Accordingly, I'm going to keep my feet and stay under control as I attempt to dash away from the blast of fire.  This is not the number one ideal way to avoid injury to myself and my gear from this particular blast, though!<br/><br/>Once the dragon's committed to breathing fire, this may be all I can control -- "Run or Dive?"  If I anticipate this attack before it's underway, though, maybe I can do something to buy myself some reaction time, increasing the chances of avoiding damage even though my priority is to not wind up prone/etc.  Maybe my adventuring party fans out, or I chuck something toward the dragon's eyes, or feint like I'm going to run left just before I run right.  So that's where the potential for clever fictional positioning comes in, if the system allows for anticipation prior to action.<br/><br/>Obviously if I anticipated incorrectly, there could be consequences to that as well.  So the system should probably help/allow us to assess that too.<br/><br/>So let's say I think there's a good chance the dragon's about to breathe fire, so I drift toward my companions preparatory to a sudden turn and dash away from them.  And then I'm right, the dragon does in fact breathe fire.  Let's call my reward for correct anticipation and useful action a +2.<br/><br/>So now I've got to choose, Run or Dive.  Our die roll(s) will determine injury to myself and my stuff, as well as whether I'm knocked into a bad position.  I choose to Run -- let's call that a -1 to avoid injury and an +1 to avoid a bad position.  I then apply my prior +2 where it makes sense -- in this case I'll say +1 to each category.  So now I'm neutral on avoiding injury and +2 to avoiding being prone or disoriented or right where the dragon wants me.<br/><br/>These bonuses and penalties could be to whatever categories you're using to generate outcomes.  Let's say we have 5 categories: No Risk, Great, Default, Bad, No Hope.  So my <i>avoiding damage</i> is left at Default, and my <i>avoiding bad position</i> winds up at No Risk.  We then roll accordingly.  If we're using PbtA trinary outcomes, the categories could be:<br/>- No Risk: 10+ extreme success / 7-9 success / 6- mixed success<br/>- Great: 10+ extreme success / 7-9 success / 6- mixed failure<br/>- Default: 10+ success / 7-9 mixed success / 6- failure<br/>- Bad: 10+ mixed success / 7-9 failure / 6- extreme failure<br/>- No Hope: 10+ mixed failure / 7-9 failure / 6- extreme failure<br/><br/>So for me that means my two die rolls are effectively sorting between these possibilities:<br/>- self and gear uninjured / slightly injured / injured<br/>- great position / fine position / fine position but something is less than ideal<br/><br/>How well does that fit what you're going for?<br/><br/>(This is actually a bit different than what I was thinking in my previous post -- here, I was trying to draw inspiration from the last thing you wrote!

I didn't know that's the angle you were coming from.  I like playing that way too, but I'll have to switch gears here.  So, okay, rather than using dice rules as your <i>primary</i> interaction with fictional positioning, you're keeping in-fiction logic primary and just trying to add on a little extra on top with the dice rules?

I mean, I mostly play OSR I and I sort of hate that meme as it is applied to that kind of game because rolling the dice is fun\u2014I much prefer David's framework of positioning letting you choose which dice to roll (and in D&amp;D it very much is which dice, since they are all formally different as well as different in stakes, unlike for example PbtA games which give you a standard sort of roll but more leeway to think up different stakes to offer on them).<br/><br/>On the other hand, a Saving Throw specifically stands out as a die you don't want to roll in most circumstances. That's it's special flavour, and when the whole party has to roll, they know they've messed up. But this part:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Full damave vs. half damage is two outcomes, and by logical extension, there exists a third outcome, in which the PCs take no damage. (This third outcome already exists by avoiding the dragon's ire, but such is not enshrined in the rules.)</p></div></blockquote>\n...isn't true! D&amp;D is packed with tools to use rules (both dice and non-dice rules) to avoid the dragon's breath entirely\u2014we roll to see if the dragon is sleeping, we roll for surprise, we roll to see if the dragon likes us, we talk about movement rates and positioning and look at the rule for the area of effect of the dragon's breath. These things are 100% enshrined in the rules! And so are Hit Points, which are really our last measure of variable difficulty from fictional positioning here, after the Saving Throw is rolled.<br/><br/>This is incredibly time consuming, but it's because this is specifically a game about fighting dragons, in a large part. In a game where dragons are fought incidentally, it makes sense to flatten them down, to produce these outcomes out of a single determination. But this framework is about giving players a decision making power over the thing that will likely be a central part of play, and is expected to take a long time.<br/><br/>I think the real question is: what are you hoping to save time <em>for</em>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464597/#Comment_464597" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-04T18:07:27+00:00" title="July  4, 2017  6:07PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 4, 2017 6:08PM by ValyrianSteelKatana.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>So, okay, rather than using dice rules as your <i>primary</i> interaction with fictional positioning, you're keeping in-fiction logic primary and just trying to add on a little extra on top with the dice rules?

Basically, a method of adjudicating fictional position in the form of improved outcomes. Regarding the dragonfire example: Bilbo's wearing his ring. Smaug breathes fire. Smaug can't tell where Bilbo is, but the fire is going everywhere, so Bilbo still has to make a saving throw. Shouldn't Bilbo have some kind of advantage based on his fictional position?

Either Bilbo's player was clever enough to achieve a fictional position where the fire can't reach him, or he wasn't.<br/><br/>This is why your system proposal seems weird to me.  Any GM who's used to reading the fiction to make rulings like these already has some sort of option(s) for "sort of" or "maybe".  "Make that roll you'd normally have to make, but with a bonus" isn't uncommon, is it?  Codifying the GM's options might be nice, but codifying overlapping concerns once the mechanics have been invoked strikes me as redundant or clashing, unless you want to change the GM's job description.<br/><br/>It could make GMing easier, if you want to change the GM's job a little!  I dunno.  Are you interested in that?  Moving from "yes/no/spot ruling" to "yes/no/rule from the book"?  I mean, the rules we've been discussing here could along belong to a "whenever the GM doesn't have a complete Yes or No" class.  The new way to GM would be: If the GM decides that Bilbo's ring is neither irrelevant nor instant success, then they think no further about save modifiers or whatever, and instead invoke the dice rules.<br/><br/>"I rule that the ring doesn't matter at all.

In this way, the dice are telling us whether Bilbo is safe from the Smaug's fire. Did he get to safety? Roll the dice and let's see. But the the binary yes/no save that dictates half/full damage is unsatisfying for me. As I said earlier:\n<blockquote>Yet all of this seems almost laughably extraneous the more I think about it. An overload of granularity and excessive complexity. Return to the initial three outcomes and translate them to PbtA:<br/><br/>6-. Full damage.<br/>7-9. Half damage.<br/>10+. No damage.<br/><br/>And one could simply assign a +1 or -1 to the roll depending on fictional positioning.</blockquote>\nSimpler, yes, but when I write these posts, I'm spitballing. Putting the ideas on paper (good and bad alike) helps me sort through them in my head.\n<blockquote>It could make GMing easier, if you want to change the GM's job a little! I dunno.

Difficulty and fictional positioning are determined not by modifying rolls (as in D&amp;D, say), but by choosing which moves we are making in the first place.<br/><br/>You want to shoot someone? It might not be a move at all, if you very well positioned. Or it might be 'go aggro', if they have a chance to get away. However, if you don't have the drop on them at all - no fictional positioning advantage - you're rolling "seize by force". It's worse than that? If your fictional positioning is really terrible, you'll probably be "acting under fire" (or even acting under fire just to get INTO position to be able to shoot).<br/><br/>That's why, when I make a hack which doesn't have moves which allow to differentiate for fictional position, I like to add a way to influence outcomes - e.g. <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21014/pbta-elemental-world-moves" rel="nofollow">Elemental World Moves</a>, or <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17652/apocalypse-world-for-kids-the-bureau-an-aw-hack-with-different-die-types" rel="nofollow">The Bureau</a>.<br/><br/>Second, on the topic of "player skill" and "tangibility":<br/><br/>There is a sliding scale here which really depends, in my experience, on player attitudes, culture, and the approach to play. <br/><br/>Anchoring outcomes as closely as possible to fictional situations and actions makes the game feel "more tangible", up until you cross over into the territory where everything becomes "up for grabs". If you have no idea what your mechanical odds are when you're doing X, it's really hard to simply "play your character", since the mechanics we agree upon help us establish the consistency of the fiction we are working with.<br/><br/>I've seen games lose "tangibility" because they felt like "button pushing", divorced from the imagined fiction... but go too far the other way, and I've seen games lose "tangibility" just as much because the lack of agreed-upon ways to determine odds and outcomes means that you're just "playing the GM", and the process of play turns into a game of social influence - again, divorcing the process from the imagined fiction.<br/><br/>I'd imagine each group's - and each player's - lines at either end of the spectrum will really vary, so it's a tricky topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464662/#Comment_464662" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-06T19:38:38+00:00" title="July  6, 2017  7:38PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Why is player skill identified so strongly with avoiding the roll here?</blockquote>\nTo piggyback of <a href="/forums/profile/2097%27s">@2097's</a> response: avoiding the roll means you're being so clever that success is guaranteed.

Not sure what the 3 ranges would be. <br/> Three-part outcomes aren't very trad...  <br/><br/>Could replace each with two yes/no rolls...<br/><br/>Weak:<br/>Horribly bad? <br/>- No = roll for 1 vs 2 Bad Things<br/>- Yes = rolls for 2 vs 3 bad Things<br/><br/>Average:<br/>Bad?<br/>- No = roll for 0 or 1 Bad Things<br/>- Yes = roll for 1 or 2 Bad Things<br/><br/>Strong:<br/>Fantastic?<br/>- Yes = roll for +1 fwd or not<br/>- No = roll for 0 or 1 Bad Things<br/><br/>If loosey-goosey is the enemy, maybe get rid of the GM picking and just divvy up the bad outcomes across those rolls?

The above is the general formula, while specifics would be outlined by the specific source of the harm. Example:<br/><br/>When the **spider attempts to sink its fangs into your flesh**, roll +whatever.<br/><br/>1. You step aside with ease, and are poised to strike. Take +1 forward.<br/>2. You nimbly avoid the spider's bite.<br/>3. The spider's fangs graze your flesh - take X damage.<br/>4. The spider's fangs drive deep into your body, and venom burns through your veins. Take X damage and you are poisoned.<br/>5. The danger comes to bear against you, worse than you thought. Take 2X damage and you are poisoned.<br/><br/>There are a few ways I'm considering doing this.<br/><br/>1. As a matter of simplicity: setting up variable difficulty levels and simply having various positions add modifiers.<br/><br/>2. More complex: roll vs. variable difficulty and tally up potential Good Things and Bad Things beyond that. The initial roll would be a yes/no ("Did you avoid the spider's bite?") and then additional Good/Bad Things would be things like:<br/><br/>\u2022 Take +1 forward.<br/>\u2022 Increase/reduce damage by X.<br/>\u2022 The spider runs out of venom.<br/><br/>To detail these mechanics further: the basic yes/no roll would be 2d6 + modifiers. Every die that comes up a 6 is a Good Thing, every die that comes up a 1 is a Bad Thing. If you're in an advantageous position, you roll an extra 1d6 that <b>only</b> counts for Good Things; if you're in a disadvantageous position, you roll an extra 1d6 that only counts for Bad Things. Or maybe it works like 5e's advantage, so you get the d6 to difficulty and Good/Bad Things.<br/><br/>I think the second system is more interesting, for what it's worth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464762/#Comment_464762" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-12T01:58:01+00:00" title="July 12, 2017  1:58AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, okay, gotcha.
