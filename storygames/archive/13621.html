I still like to give some sort of moniker to the works I produce.<br/>Most of the time, when thinking of a name, I try to do something that evokes the feel of the game, without stating outright what it is. For example, my stormtrooper game is called "Screw You Rebel Scum!," because it evokes what the characters generally think, without being a title like "Stormtroopers Killing Rebels."<br/><br/>More difficult is with the hack of Dungeonslayers that I've been working on for many, many months. Originally I was calling it "DungeonCrashers," which was originally going to be a comic I was sketching out when living in Japan, and it just kinda fit for the game. But someone mentioned somewhere (I think it was on the Praxis page) that they were going to be naming their game DungeonCrashers...so I decided to drop my hold on the name (just cuz).<br/>Currently thinking of "Adventurers &amp; Artifacts," though the "name + name" thing has been done to death.<br/><br/>But anyway, it helps to get out a huge-ass Thesaurus (avoid online ones, since I find them to be lacking in depth), and look up some words that you think best describe your game.

Most of the time adding one extra search criteria in Google will fix that, in this case "RPG" or "Game." This works on single word games like <i>Fiasco</i> (getting the right result first or second in the Google search).<br/><br/>There are certain words / titles that this wouldn't work for, <i>Do</i> being one of them. You would have to own the top result for the word "game" or "RPG" with the word "do" on it, for it to show up as a top result. That isn't going to happen. I've been considering the name <i>C0DE</i> for a game I'm working on and running into the same problem. People who search "code + rpg" or "code + game" will never get my game as a top result. <br/><br/>However, <i>Loom</i> shouldn't have that problem. It should be as easy to find as <i>Fiasco</i> (after a reasonable amount of time, and a little online promotion).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307937/#Comment_307937" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-12T13:46:17+00:00" title="January 12, 2011  1:46PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RichD</cite>How likely your game will be found on Google is also a concern when naming.

I feel like coming up with titles for things is highly situational. I know that, generally, I look for things that are euphonic (that is, sounds good), that have an enigmatic element while still being very clear, as well as something that googles well.
