We were bear and hippo on voyage from Poland to Africa. There was also a captain, but he decided to stay in his african home and soon bear and hippo took over the ship and had many adventures during the sea trek to Poland again. We were eating fishes, octopuses and sharks, sailing through storms, avoiding huuuge waves and pirates, being stranded on numerous islands, splashing in shallow waters. Also brief time exploring Africa and climbing really high mountains.<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting facts:<br/>\n- captain was left in Africa because nobody wanted to play him<br/>\n- usually it was Ksawery who came up with ideas, funny thing happened when I proposed something outside his knowledge. There was brief WTF look in his eyes and then he quickly got back to safe route (Look, there's a shark swimming by, let's eat him!)<br/>\n-  use of piano - my nephew played loud during the storm, low notes when pirates attacked, quiet when the sea was peaceful, etc.<br/>\n- changes between stances - one time he was playing his character (hippo) and another he jumped to the piano and directed events<br/>\n- there was this voyage back to Poland, but he quickly forgot about the destination and had fun with adventures at sea<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's all.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175226/#Comment_175226" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-16T15:10:19+00:00" title="October 16, 2008  3:10PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Y'know, I'd love to hear more about the use of the piano, if you've got any more to say about it.  I've been trying to think of formalized ways to use extemporaneous musical accompaniment in roleplaying for a long time now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
