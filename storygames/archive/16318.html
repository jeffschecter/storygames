I think it was on a narrative control podcast episode where they were talking about using timers to increase tension, during D&amp;D; games one of the hosts had actually given the thief one of those 3D dimensional puzzles to solve while the others battled to their death. There's the tower in dread of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo players usually enjoy the extra bit of player skill involved, do things like coins for money, maps, minis, shotgun shells in Apocalypse World. What are peoples' experience with them both behind and in front of the screen?<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean just looking at the kickstarter project for a spoken magic system <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/500894669/serpents-tongue-a-new-magick-experience" rel="nofollow">Serpent's Tongue</a> really makes me want to adapt it for use in an RPG.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372675/#Comment_372675" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-13T07:14:31+00:00" title="April 13, 2012  7:14AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm all for props as props, things to inspire and create ambiance.

Agon's attack and defense dice in separate hands is very visceral and effective too, and I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that my (now free!) game Mist-Robed Gate uses a knife as a state indicator, literal prop, and symbol of the violence inherent in communication all at once, and it is very effective at getting its message across.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372698/#Comment_372698" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-13T09:36:44+00:00" title="April 13, 2012  9:36AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1 for the prop love.<br><br>I haven't done a just-for-show prop since I was in high school (candles, goblets, decorative dagger, all that ren faire crap), but if I have the time I do love to do up stuff for my games that actually conveys information or context.<br><br>A good hand-drawn map is priceless, especially if you're savvy about designing it so it's imperfect. I did a fantasy game that had 3 different maps of the same area drawn by three different in-fiction characters (and fabricated by me and two friends who weren't in the game), because I really wanted to push this unreliable-witness thing in the game. The Templar dude was all about holy sites and claiming certain areas in the name of his god. The tomb robber dude was all about where to get loot and how to avoid the authorities. I think there was some forest nymph character who did up the map in terms of which spirits ruled which areas. And they shared only a few landmarks, so the game became matching up each of the maps to come up with a "true" idea of the surroundings. And they were all drawn at different scales and by different people, based only on verbal directions from me. Probably my all-time best set of props.<br><br>My current favorite prop is the fancy Tiddlywiki file that the SWN Generator pumped out. I've been <a href="http://www.z-com.com/SWN/PCindex.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">editing the file and dolling it up so it can be an in-game resource for the players.</a> We have a couple tablets available so they just load up that page and it's their characters' information source. Probably the tablets are more the prop; the file's just a file. But it gives the players a physical interaction, which Shreyas points out above is super cool.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372700/#Comment_372700" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-13T09:45:29+00:00" title="April 13, 2012  9:45AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I'd rather have good props from a GM who's otherwise winging it than have more GM prep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372770/#Comment_372770" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-13T17:33:06+00:00" title="April 13, 2012  5:33PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Has anyone taken systems from other games and used them in their games for flavor as well? Like putting experience keys or aspects in D&amp;D; worked well for my group. I'm pretty sure it was on narrative control again, back in the day, that they talked about adding minigames to simulate tension and make for a big set piece.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe they talked about using <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3728/ker-plunk" rel="nofollow">Kerplunk</a> in a game to simulate tension and the scene exploding into a gun fight or <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6481/phoenix" rel="nofollow">Phoenix</a> in an infiltration scene, mostly for the cool factor but to also make sure that all the players had something to do, all had some buy-in.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone done anything like that in their games? A quick google search turns up a ton of fan created MTG projects where they actually their decks to play as well, for example.  I'm seriously thinking about incorporating Serpent's Tongue into an RPG but I'm hesitant to incorporate other games into an existing game and staking systems on top of systems. To make it work all the players would have to mages obviously, I'm guessing it would work better if an rpg was built around it instead of trying to incorporate it into an existing rpg. Do people think it'd be worth doing or is there a place for boardgames and Serpent's Tongue, etc over here and then a place for rpgs over there and it's best not to mix them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
