Got two players to join who hadn't tried it yet, and Mike <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> (or was it <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>?...) who had participated in the previous game with the Psychic Gestalt Warlord.<br/><br/><b>\u201cLittle Messy Miss\u201d</b><br/>The first feature was a still-in-development reskin of <b>Pocket Danger Patrol</b> based on the cartoon series <b><i>Powerpuff Girls</i></b>. (I\u2019m still tinkering around a bit with this one, but I\u2019ll probably try posting it early next week).<br/>The episode opens in the classic fashion:<br/>[In a calm voice] \u201cThe city of Townsville\u2026\u201d [and then screaming] \u201c\u2026is being VANDALIZED!\u201d<br/><b>Little Miss Mental</b> (a rival of the current Powerpuff Girls) and her <b>High-Pitched Henchmen</b> are tagging all the buildings in Townsville with spraypaint! Apparently, it is some kind of magical spraypaint, that, when enough buildings are tagged, will cause the citizens of Townsville to believe that it all belongs to Little Miss Mental!<br/>Enter this season\u2019s new <b>Powerpuff Girls</b>!!<br/><b>Sparkle</b> (played by Tyler), the Shy Daydreamer with lightning blasts and really good skin!<br/><b>Twinkle-Toes</b> (played by Mike #2), the adorable Curious Prankster, master of ventriloquism and knot-tying!<br/>And <b>Holly</b> (played by Phi), the Silly Delinquent armed with a party cannon and a \u201cYou Don\u2019t Recognize Me\u201d mask!<br/>But where are the Townsville Police? Turns out they\u2019ve been corralled by Miss Mental\u2019s partner-in-crime, the angry celebrity <b>Bush Tucker Bill</b> and his pet incendiary dinosaur, <b>Burnasaurus Rex</b>.<br/>Sparkle starts off by going to clean up all the paint with some experimental turpentine from Professor Utonium\u2019s lab, and BOOM, wipes out that threat in one shot. (silly me, I should\u2019ve made it a staged threat\u2026oh well)<br/>Holly follows up by inviting Little Miss Mental to a party! (apparently her secret desire was to be \u201cpopular\u201d and she fell for the bait). Holly describes Little Miss Mental leaving the scene, only to show up at a party where she becomes the target of prank after prank!<br/>Twinkle-Toes decides that Burnasaurus Rex is too dangerous to be wandering around the flammable Townsville, and does everything she can to make herself look extra tasty, luring the beast down to the docks, and onto a pier that had been handily weakened when some of its support struts were sawn in half. However, it looks like the creature\u2019s tail whipped around a bit too much, as several buildings had caught fire!<br/>Sparkle apparently lost her temper, and beat up a group of Henchmen, and Holly followed suit. But without their leader, the Henchmen were no longer henching, but had become full-fledged looters and rioters. Their actions were completely unpredictable, as they did some very un-supervillain-like things\u2026like stealing televisions, throwing bottles, and otherwise acting like soccer hooligans.<br/>Still, at this point, it didn\u2019t take long to mop up the remaining henchmen, and after insulting Bush Tucker Bill\u2019s Australian heritage (though it turned out he was from New Zealand, but with a name like \u201cBush Tucker,\u201d who was to know?), he was handily defeated as well.<br/><br/><b>\u201cMurder on the Martian Express\u201d</b><br/>The second feature was proper <b>Pocket Danger Patrol</b>.<br/>The episode opens with a Gravtrain Express rushing across the Martian desert, taking members of the Martian Archaeological Dig back to Rocket City. But tragedy strikes when the head of the expedition, <b>Professor Zood</b>, is found dead in his cabin, his detachable head missing, and his torso head-dock destroyed! His cold titanium arms are holding a strange, glowing, and increasingly loud device in a death grip! Elsewhere on the Gravtrain, some malignant psychic influence is turning passengers into mindless maniacs bent on mayhem! Thankfully, the Danger Patrol was on the scene!<br/><b>Kent Batemen</b>, the Atomic Detective (played by Tyler) uses his special temporal vision goggles to look back in time to view the last moments before Prof. Zood\u2019s death. He discovers that Zood\u2019s murderer was someone known to the Professor, and was wearing Venusian Lizard-Leather shoes that squeaked on the floors! And whoever it was used the Professor\u2019s atomic power source (since Zood was also an Atomic) to power the glowing device \u2013 a extradimensional focal point to allow the <b>Gigantic Conqueror Bartok Sigma</b> to enter this reality!<br/><b>River Jane</b>, the Psychic Warrior (played by Phi) in the meantime is wading through waves of maniacal passengers, trying to discover the cause of the psychic disturbance! She discovers a strange antenna attached to the roof of the Gravtrain, wired into the control sub-systems. She sabotages it, but not before the otherworldly mind of Bartok Sigma tries to take over her mind!<br/><b>Lance Larson</b>, the Intrepid Explorer (played by Mike #2) decides to put a quick end to the Conqueror\u2019s evil plans, and tosses the glowing device from the train, narrowly missing River Jane\u2019s head as she climbs back into the passenger car! It indeed detonates, imploding in on itself, but releases a psychic shockwave that causes intercranial pain on all biological lifeforms within five miles!<br/>Meanwhile, Kent Batemen uses his superior deductive reasoning to discover that the murderer was none other than Professor Zood\u2019s own assistant, <b>Perry Dongle</b>, who was the disciple of Bartok Sigma! Without mercy, Kent shoved Perry Dongle into the arms of the ravening passenger maniacs, to be torn apart!<br/>River Jane, hearing the screams of Perry Dongle (but not immediately recognizing that he was getting his just desserts), tries to fight off Bartok Sigma\u2019s influence, fighting him back with her psychic power! She succeeds, forcing him back into his own dimension, but in the process her higher-functioning consciousness is trapped there as well! This leaves her body firmly in control of her savage and blood-thirsty instincts, and she turns on her own team!<br/>Thinking quickly, Lance Larson traps River inside one of the passenger cars, and separates it from the rest of the Gravtrain, leaving it to drift slowly to a stop! Hopefully they can get some interdimensional psychologists to help put her mind back together!<br/>Finally, with Bartok Sigma\u2019s influence gone, Kent is able to break the mind-control that has been affecting the passengers, and the day is finally saved!<br/><br/>One thing I am beginning to notice is that it is really hard getting these adventures to run longer than a single action scene. So far, either the heroes have saved the day completely, or been completely wiped out. I'm currently tinkering around with some ideas of my own to help build multiple-scene adventures, which will probably center around having villains that somehow escape in the middle of a scene, to return with new machinations and reinforcements in later scenes. Still <i>not quite sure</i> how it would work yet...<br/>Nevertheless, it was still quite a bit of fun.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dr_Stone" title="Dr_Stone"><img alt="Dr_Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dr_Stone">Dr_Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375640/#Comment_375640" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T16:21:25+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  4:21PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've not played it, yet, but my guess on structuring multi-scene adventures was to have the threat be staged.

A few rolls of the dice determines what kind of Threats you'll have on the board during a single action scene, each action scene having 3 Threats + the number of players.<br/><br/>In previous editions, the "Previously On" segments would create a whole slew of ideas that could then be tied into the adventure at a moment's notice. This plays in with your suggestion of the "staged" threats. And yeah, I could still be doing that here, but the dynamic feels a bit different with Pocket Danger Patrol, at least so far that I've experienced.<br/><br/>Right now, my thoughts are of splitting the adventure into, essentially, two acts: Before Commercial and After Commercial.<br/><br/>The first act introduces several minor threats and the vestiges of the plot. Before play begins, the players would do their "Previously On" bits, which would provide ample fodder for ideas later on. The action happens, stuff blows up, Threats are defeated, heroes get scuffed up, and hints are dropped about the villainous machinations behind the threats in the first act.<br/><br/>Right after the first act, the heroes get a chance to recover, gather their forces, and discuss their plans. This would be their chance to gather intel, travel to new locations, and talk to various authorities. The GM in the meantime gets to do some kind of "behind the scenes" reveal, setting up the stage for the next act.<br/><br/>The second act would be much like the first, but with more Threats, and a Boss Threat. This Boss would have one to three linked Threats, which serve to protect it. These threats may actually be bodyguards, forcefields, environmental hazards, or maybe even superiour kung fu techniques, all of which must be defeated before the Boss can be dealt with. This Boss could also be a Threat recovered from the first act, who, when defeated, retreated instead of surrendering or being knocked out. The episode ends once the boss is defeated (and the credits roll with the surviving Danger Patrol members laughing heroically), or once the Danger Meter hits 10 (in which case it ends in a cliffhanger).<br/><br/>...at least, those are my thoughts so far. Not much science to this, but instead based on observation of the flow of the action in the old B&amp;W sci-fi serials and action cartoons.<br/><br/>For example, in act one, Zoltar the Space Conqueror and his minions attack Rocket City, trying to carry off shielded containers of material from a military base. Danger Patrol intervenes, and defeats them, but Zoltar gets away (since he is the boss). The heroes do some research into the materials Zoltar was trying to steal, discover they are elements necessary to power some great battleship, and learn that Zoltar has returned and used traitorous soldiers to procure the elements he needed. The second act is a fight between the Danger Patrol, Zoltar, his battleship's defense systems (the linked Threats), and the aforementioned traitorous soldiers.<br/><br/><br/>...so, yeah, kinda like what you were saying. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>I just need to set up some kind of standard or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dr_Stone" title="Dr_Stone"><img alt="Dr_Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dr_Stone">Dr_Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375683/#Comment_375683" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T18:19:26+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  6:19PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I wanted to watch some of these source materials, do you have any suggestions of ones which are readily available?

It has a lot of really mind-meltingly bad shows that are, nevertheless, surprisingly good sources of inspiration (like <i>Here Comes Tobor</i>, <i>Rocky Jones: Space Ranger</i>, and <i>Space Angel</i>, and some timeless classics (in particular <i>Undersea Kingdom</i>, <i>Phantom Empire</i>, and the B&amp;W TV version of <i>Flash Gordon</i>). Not sure how available it is outside of the United States, but where I'm at, it's dirt cheap (like $10-$15 for about 150 mixed episodes).<br/><br/>There's also a DVD collection of the old <i>Green Hornet</i> movie serials, as well as the WWII-era <i>Batman</i> series (though it is painfully racist).<br/><br/>...and, though it may seem bizarre, the new <i>The Aquabats Supershow</i>, which seems like it was practically written using Danger Patrol (especially if you watch the "Previously On").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
