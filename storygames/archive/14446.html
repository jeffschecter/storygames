It was set in a small town on the Oregeon coast in 1920.  Most of the sessions for the show/season had been pretty dark; racism, despondency, stubbornness, abuse, marital strife, irredeemable family members.  A few murders...<br/><br/>The main sources of much of the external conflict came to an end in the final scenes; the corrupting town patriarch and the wayward brother who could never fit in.  And each of the protagonists had been showing at least some promise in grappling with their internal issues.<br/><br/>We rewarded ourselves with some pretty positive epilogues that felt earned, both from the previous fiction and from some earlier scenes where we were engaging with the game's mechanics.  The epilogues themselves had no mechanics, but were simply narration - individual and by group consensus.<br/><br/>Do you like games with epilogues recommended or mandated by the game itself?  Do you prefer some kind of mechanical accounting that guides or requires a specific kind of epilogue?  Do you find yourself appending epilogues to games that don't necessarily describe their use in the text?  Why?  What sort of things contribute to these epilogues feeling "earned"?  Can you recall a time when epilogues felt like they had a jarring shift in mood/mode?<br/><br/>Fiasco has a mechanical sub-system to guide your epilogues.  I think it works pretty well in the context of a one-shot for the kind of game experience it sets out to facilitate.  Does this design space interest you and what other kinds of games might benefit from a similar method?  Or do you prefer to just make them up guided only by the fiction that came before?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328680/#Comment_328680" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T21:11:38+00:00" title="June  8, 2011  9:11PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco has been one of the few games where an Epilogue seems to work as part of the system. Of course, I can't remember any other game in recent memory where an Epilogue has been required or even suggested...I know I've seen one, but it obviously didn't make much of an impact on my brain.<br/><br/>But as a part of the fiction, I do tend to use Epilogues often enough, at least in the shorter campaigns. It adds a bit of closure, and sometimes is satisfying for the players (at least I think it makes them feel a bit better about the crap they've had to wade through to get to the conclusion, if they hear what fruits their actions have bore...bared...uh...damned English language...)<br/>I want to allow, in the future, to have players create parts of an Epilogue, but most of my friends aren't into the self-narration thing yet. Oh, they'll give plenty of suggestions, but so far they don't really want to take the reins of major game narration just yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mr%20Sitouh" title="Mr Sitouh"><img alt="Mr Sitouh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mr%20Sitouh">Mr Sitouh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328707/#Comment_328707" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-09T00:39:55+00:00" title="June  9, 2011 12:39AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bliss Stage has something epilogue-like - once all the Hopes for the campaign are resolved, the last player gets to narrate the way things all wrap up.

I'll try that next time I do any major GMing. But I know there'll be at least three players (out of nine...we got a big group) who will completely balk at the idea. Of course, they're also the ones who quit playing if there isn't enough combat...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328936/#Comment_328936" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-09T23:25:12+00:00" title="June  9, 2011 11:25PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first long campaign of Apocalypse World we played, we ended up adding epilogues at the end. While I would say I generally like games where the epilogue is mandated along with some kind of mechanical guidance (eg. Fiasco), in this case that wasn't really necessary, and probably would have been annoying instead, because we had played the characters and interacted with the setting for so long (15+ sessions IIRC.) Having dice decide what happens to them after that long would seem silly, compared to our ability as players/authors/audience to simply consider what results seemed likely or interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329068/#Comment_329068" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-10T20:41:48+00:00" title="June 10, 2011  8:41PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I often use epilogues in Matrix games.

It seemed appropriate that the players would get to narrate a final sweeping snapshot of their characters without any interference from the other players or the system.<br/><br/>On the other hand, for Mars Colony, I specifically say in the rules that the players are not allowed to narrate an epilogue.  You narrate the end of the story, but that's it.  There is no way to narrate how Kelly Perkins ends up in, say, 10 years.  Mars Colony has a very different scope.  I want players to feel like they've played through this quick gut-punch of a story-line, and then have no recourse to make it alright.  The story just has to sit there and fester: "Bam! You're done.Now deal with it."  That was the design goal, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
