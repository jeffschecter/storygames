It was great fun, and everyone enjoyed themselves, although not all the game mechanics worked as smoothly as I was hoping.<br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing is an AP from my first time running this game, posted partly in hopes that any comments might improve my next game, and partly because I'm such a fan of the game that I want to share the experience with others. The AP, being long, is divided into two posts, story generation/set-up and the game itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nThe group was a mix of gamers and non-gamers, all close friends. In addition to myself, there was James (who regularly plays RPGs), Mary (who said she thought I was bringing a board game, and said that I had "tricked" her), Edward (who has played some D&amp;D in the past, and was not all that into it), and Chris (who has never played an RPG and previously was only willing to do so if he "lost a bet"). Part of the reason for selecting IAWA was that it was very different from traditional RPGs, which I knew would not go over very well.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone was willing to play, however, and the game set-up went great. I thought I'd explain the rules as we went along, so we jumped right into generating story elements and characters. The group agreed on "The Unquiet Past" as an oracle, and each player chose a card. The elements we ended up with were:<br/>\n<br/>\n-- The secret shrine of a temple to forbidden gods<br/>\n-- A long-dead queen, still trying to defend her realm<br/>\n-- The awakening of three powerful and malignant genii<br/>\n-- A necromancer who steals the knowledge of the dying<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were some obvious characters in the elements (the queen's spirit, the necromancer, the three genii, and the last priest of the forbidden gods), to which the players added an evil monarch (who had overthrown the queen), the king's daughter (who loved the necromancer), and (for some reason) a magical coin possessed of a split personality. This first part of the game went beautifully. Everyone got right into creating the characters and setting with very little prompting from me, and came up with many cool bits. <br/>\n<br/>\n-- Chris' character: The necromancer/royal undertaker, who had learned about how good things used to be back in the days of the old queen during his routine theft of knowledge from the dying (which he did merely as a way to pass the time), and who was newly dedicated to the overthrow of the evil king.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Edward's character: The evil king, who wanted an "interesting life" for his daughter, and had a terrible fear of the magical coin.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- James' character: The three genii (yes, all three), who were nominally in the employ of the evil king, but who really just wanted to sow chaos and see human misery.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Mary' character: The last priest of the forbidden gods, who wanted to see the evil king overthrown, but did not want to get involved with helping the necromancer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe actual mechanics of character creation went fairly smoothly. Assigning dice to the forms is pretty intuitive (once the non-gamers got past the weirdness and social stigma of polyhedral dice), as is assigning best interests. I stressed the need to have everyone's best interests in conflict, and the players did that well. We also put together a relationship map, which I started, but Mary understood and helped with (She must have encountered that concept in some non-gaming context, but I forgot to ask her about it).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only part that was a bit difficult was particular strengths. The idea is not hard to explain, but I think I threw the doors open too wide in my examples, because everyone chose a pretty abstract concept for their strength (no fear of death, the ability to sense motives, terrible allure, and stillness amidst chaos). I put some emphasis on the mythic, fairy-tale nature of the game, and everyone made their strength a little more concrete and supernatural (for example, the king's ability to sense the motives of others was dependent on him being close enough to breathe in their breath). The hard part was assigning forms and a power to the strengths. At this point we hadn't been over the conflict rules in much detail, so those things didn't mean a lot yet. Since we had been working on this for a while, I hurried things along, and I think everyone just kind of picked something without much thought ("Okay, uh, I'll say 'broad'. What the hell, right?"). Which was not such a big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter creation was a big success, and an enjoyable part of the game in and of itself.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183201/#Comment_183201" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T12:46:40+00:00" title="December 13, 2008 12:46PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After we had characters, I went over the conflict rules briefly, and we got right into it, with the opening scene being a room in the castle where the headstrong princess was demanding that the undertaker (Chris' character) immediately ask her father for her hand in marriage, which he did not really want to do. The scene moved quickly to the throne room, where we added the king (Edward's character) and the evil, scheming genii (James' characters). It was a long, funny scene, and everyone enjoyed it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, the plot we had all been implying in the creation stage (a rebellion led by the undertaker against the tyrannical king, in the name of the old queen) never quite materialized. The plot turned into more of a wacky comedy, with everyone conspiring to get the undertaker married off to the princess against his will, and the genii running around making life hard for everyone else. The king also turned out to not be so big a villain after all. Edward said afterwards that once he was playing the character, he didn't really want him to be such a bad guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were only a few issues (I wouldn't call them problems, since the game overall was very successful).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne was the lack of conflicts. Entire scenes would go by with no dice hitting the table, and most of the conflicts were me pushing the characters into something with an NPC. We only had one conflict at the end of the game between players. The scenes were great, and the level of role-playing was absolutely terrific, so a couple of times the conflicts seemed almost forced. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe characters had been well-designed, and were well-played, so were almost constantly in "conflict" in a descriptive sense, but it was mostly clashes of words and motivations. The game rules are quite explicit about not using dice to resolve those kinds of confrontations, we I didn't. A couple times, the players were ready to use dice, but it just didn't seem appropriate, such as when the genii (James) wanted to convince the undertaker (Chris) to marry the princess and kill her off (or something like that). I was tempted to use the conflict rules more like Burning Wheel's Duel of Wits, but the game text seemed firm on that, so I settled for pushing the players to escalate conflicts to action of some sort.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may have been off in my ideas about when the conflict resolution rules should enter the game, or perhaps, being mostly non-gamers, were more content than most to simply role-play their way to the next plot development. Like I said, the story was enjoyable, so it wasn't a big issue. There were maybe 4-5 dice conflicts in the course of a three-hour session (not including an hour of prep/set-up).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dice rules themselves worked pretty well, even though we didn't go to them often. Despite my lack of familiarity with the rules, I didn't need to consult the text more than once or twice. Advantage dice make sense, and I can see how they work, although the players didn't quite get that bit, and always seemed surprised (but pleased) when they had earned an advantage die. At first I wasn't sure whether particular strength dice were added to the high roll, or were just an extra number you could use. I went with the latter, which I *think* is correct.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe players didn't use their dice very strategically, until the final conflict, when they were crafting their responses to make use of their best forms. I guess that just comes with experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother issue was that no one made it to the "We Owe" list. I explained the concept, and everyone got it, but the conditions never worked out to get anyone on the list. Probably because we had so few dice-based conflicts. Edward explained the list as representing what the story itself owed to the characters, which I thought was an awesome way to put it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, the NPCs fell by the wayside somewhat. We never lacked for forward story momentum, so I think that was fine; better to have the player-characters drive the action. One NPC, the princess, was in quite a  few scenes, and drove a lot of action. Another, the queen's spirit, never made it into the story at all, despite a couple half-assed attempts on my part. The third was the magical coin, which we all liked (it's best interests were to protect the evil king and to destroy him; it had an image of the king engraved on one side, and an image of the overthrown queen on the other), but it's really hard to work a coin into scenes without having it turn into the One Ring. It showed up in one scene, in a bag of ill-gotten gold, and it got into kind of a fight with the evil king, but after that it disappeared. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo all in all, the game was a big success, and everyone had a good time. Everyone was startled at how late it was when we wrapped up, which is always good. We discussed it a bit afterwards, and everyone agreed its not something they would have ordinarily done, but they'd like to play again. We didn't really talk about another chapter in game terms, but we agreed it would be cool to go back and see how the evil king managed to overthrow the old queen, and figure out what the hell was up with that weird coin.<br/>\n<br/>\nI definitely intend to run this game again, hopefully with both this group and others. I'd like to see the dice hit the table more often, but maybe that will come naturally when the players have a better understanding of the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nOften, after I run a game for the first time, my main goal for the next time is to understand the rules better (pretty much every BW game I've ever played), but that wasn't a problem at all with IAWA. I'd run it again tonight with no prep. That is OUTSTANDING, and nothing I've ever experienced before. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn case I haven't made it clear, this is a terrific game, and beautifully-suited to introducing non-gamers to role-playing. The issues raised above were more along the lines of things that didn't work like I expected, not things that didn't work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183212/#Comment_183212" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T13:23:16+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  1:23PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, congratulations!

I've been throwing buying this game around, and this thread pushes me towards springing for it.<br/><br/>A question, however:<br/><br/>Most of the gamers I play with are very "traditional." They find things like Houses of the Blooded's player-created setting material challenging and like to have jealous control of their own characters, like characters that are real, singular people (rather than groups of people, coins, or other such weirdness) - stuff like that. Does In A Wicked Age support more traditional imagining of character and narrative, or will people like my people find it frustrating. Alternately, will they find it playable - even fun - but will the <i>game</i> lose something in the translation?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183270/#Comment_183270" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T22:03:35+00:00" title="December 13, 2008 10:03PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark<br/><br/>In my play of this game, I've only ever played the game with singular real people as characters. The characters can be demons and gods, but it's pretty rare for them to actually be more than one person. Also, I'm unsure of how a REALLY trad group would handle it because there is a bit of setting-building at the beginning of a game but that can be glossed over and done really GM-directed in style. Otherwise, uh it should be golden. The conflict mechanics are even described in traditional game terms in one of the subheadings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183271/#Comment_183271" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T22:06:04+00:00" title="December 13, 2008 10:06PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2008 10:08PM by Brian_Minter.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If, by "traditional" characters, you mean swordsmen and wizards and pirates instead of coins and talking rabbits, then you have nothing to fear.

One character is consistently pointed at as being the villain by everyone except the player of that character, who insists that he is simply being misunderstood and abused by the table.

Two characters (the undertaker and the monk) had best interests that involved bringing down a third character (the evil king), but one of those two (the monk), had a second interest that prevented her from working with the other one (the undertaker). So there's a fairly complex web right there. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother character (the genii) had an interest about causing misery for humans, along with an interest about serving the most powerful character, so he was pretty tied in to things as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I mentioned before, I don't think the characters weren't created well, I think the players just didn't get involved in dice-worthy conflicts very often.

Also cool.<br/><br/>Totally not worth stressing about, so I recommend you continue to not worry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184346/#Comment_184346" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-19T19:15:39+00:00" title="December 19, 2008  7:15PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Me too.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184439/#Comment_184439" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-20T19:59:18+00:00" title="December 20, 2008  7:59PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks to all for the help and responses.

It's just not their thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my social network, I have some friends who have gamed for years and years, and others who have never gamed and have no interest in it. Surely it can't come as a surprise to anyone that the perception of role-playing games is not always positive. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case, I'd been looking for a good game to play with some of my non-gamer friends. Not to make gamers out of them, just because I have creative and smart friends, and I thought we'd all enjoy it. I had considered some other games for this, most notably Dogs in the Vineyard and Spirit of the Century, but in both of those cases I felt like the inherent setting would have been too far out of context.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe moment I read In A Wicked Age, I knew it was the perfect game for this, and I was absolutely correct. The "setting" doesn't require any explanation or buy-in (unlike DitV), the rules are fairly simple, and the character/story generation process is a great way to draw people into the game and get their creative energies flowing.<br/>\n<br/>\n* The one modification I made to IAWA's implied setting was to stress "myths and fairy tales" instead of "sword and sorcery".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
