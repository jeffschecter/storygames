Maybe ping or re-ping some radars out there. Hopefully at least one of the following items generates some interesting discussion, because I really enjoy talking about my game. I'm kind of an expert on it or something. <br/><br/>It uses a step-die system. This was all inspired last year when I read a <a>very short thread on RPGNet's Game Design Forum</a> that asked what the chances were of a d4 beating a d12. The answer is 1 in 8. And I thought that was a pretty cool number. If d12 is an expert and d4 is a novice, you can pretty much count on the expert winning...but the novice can always get lucky. And that's what I think is cool about step-dice \u2014 before you roll the dice, everyone has a chance.<br/><br/>I really wanted to play to the strengths of the step-dice idea. All the math is in the dice already, right: each step up means a greater average roll and a greater maximum. I didn't want any math to happen after you chose which dice to roll. Whatever number shows up on the die <em>is</em> your result. That means no adding of static-modifiers and no adding dice together. AGON is obviously the biggest inspiration here: roll multiple dice but only keep the highest result. Awesome. In my case, I decided bonuses could be represented by adding dice to your pool and penalties could be represented by removing dice from your pool. By keeping only the highest die result, you still have this nicely contained range of results.<br/><br/>I like that limited, contained feel because I was writing a game about history. It's historical as in there are no fantasy elements: no magic, no monsters. Which is a very liberating restriction to have in your game. I didn't have to worry about issues of scale which ate up so much of my time in previous games I had worked on. I didn't have to worry about how the game handles fights between giants and halflings or between pixies and dragons. Everything in CF is deliberately in the human scale. It's all human versus human conflict. And step-dice fit into that because, yeah, they're hard to scale, but there's so much you can do with the 5 steps between d4 and d12 if you focus on that range.<br/><br/>The idea of mentors as a character creation tool is something that stuck with me from a previous game design. I had been working on the predecessor for two years. I shelved it once it just got too weighted down with the baggage it accumulated over the years and decided to start fresh. Well, almost fresh \u2014 I couldn't shake how cool I think mentors are.<br/><br/>So in historical fiction, and even non-fiction, you can look at the protagonist's skill set and then point to the person in their lives who taught those skills to them. A character might have learned to carve stone by being an apprentice to a mason, or learned to ride and fight by being a squire to a knight. So that's what the mentor system does in CF. You pick the three mentors (each a kind of template archetype), and they each teach you skills and give you tools. Then once play begins, you want to maintain your relationship with these mentors because they can help you advance your skills. And you want to create new relationships with additional mentors because they can help you advance the skills you haven't learned yet. So it's a little bit life-path, but it starts to create a relationship map at the same time because they are important people in your character's life.<br/><br/>Backgrounds are another thing that are kind of unique to CF. Bailywolf had been talking about this idea of the <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=406057" rel="nofollow">character sheet as a game content voting ballot</a> over at RPGNet and talked about this cool thing he calls 'gimmes'. The idea being is they are flags that tell the GM what elements that the player doesn't want to deal with in the game. I thought this was an important thing to have in a historical game, where the setting is rife with material you might not necessarily want to see creeping into your escapist fun. So I stole the idea from Bailywolf (with his blessing).<br/><br/>Here's an example <a href="http://www.therpghaven.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=539" rel="nofollow">I used at The RPG Haven</a>. It's been quoted around these parts before:\n<blockquote>I should think it might be fun to play an Arab or African character from some Islamic province who is traveling through Europe and having adventures. The fact that he is Muslim might be an important detail that I want my fellow players to know about. It's part of the flavor of the character. But I don't want game sessions where at every turn, my character is confronted about his religion. Having a background says that I've dealt with that already and we can move on. Or that if it comes up, we'll assume my character will win that discussion and we'll fast-forward past it.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if I trust that my GM and fellow players up to exploring the issue in a mature way, I could switch it to being an aspect we could play out one of these confrontations and see where that leads us.</blockquote>\nSo backgrounds are an anti-flag which I think provide a nice symmetry with aspects which are the ultimate pro-flag.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231578/#Comment_231578" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T07:57:18+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  7:57AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2009 4:53AM by Jeremy Keller.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Which brings me to aspects. Aspects did what I want in this game so perfectly, that if I had designed something of my own here they would have just been the aspects mechanics but with different names: like facets or something. I needed a good way to conceptualize those bonuses and penalties that I mentioned would work into the step-die system without having to enumerate each one. And aspects do that \u2014 they describe something beneficial or hindering (or preferably both wrapped into a nice little package). It's a slick mechanic that does a lot of the heavy lifting in the system. It replaces the need for attributes, advantages, disadvantages, situational modifiers, and a lot of other exception-based design that one finds in trad games.<br/><br/>Here's what I do differently with them. They have ranks - just because that fits in well with the whole step-die thing. Besides invokes and compels, I added the ability to <em>endure</em> aspects. Which simply means that the aspect causes a penalty in exchange for an Ardor point. It's not as harsh as a compel \u2014 it doesn't completely prevent you from doing something \u2014 it just makes it a little harder. And then I tweaked the terminology a bit. I don't use the term 'tag'. The word just didn't seem to fit into the atmosphere I was building with the narrator. So you just invoke other people's aspects. Instead of invoke or tag for effect, you make a <em>declaration</em>. Aspects that are the results of maneuvers are called <em>conditions</em> and those that are the results of an attack are called <em>injuries</em>. Instead of Fate points, you have <em>Ardor</em> points.<br/><br/>Hopefully some of you are still with me. So feel free to ask questions or let me know what you think is interesting or terrible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231610/#Comment_231610" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T08:56:24+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  8:56AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have any questions, because I have the game (and it made me scrap my own agon-influenced mediaeval design, dammit), but I thought the idea of Mentors rather than, say, careers or lifepaths or whatever, was a stroke of genius for a medieval game.<br/><br/>Backgrounds are very neat too.<br/><br/>I'm still undecided on stepped aspects, but I do think the endure tweak is a very good addition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231622/#Comment_231622" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T09:12:25+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  9:12AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeremy,<br/><br/>I have a question in regards to the layout of the game.

So partially, I would say, it's because it's what I know. But <i>Chronica Feudalis</i> itself has an academic or scholarly bent to it, so I always thought it worked. Plus, given the conceit, there's a little bit of a narrative to how the rules are explained. I didn't really want the flow interrupted by spreading it out too much.<br/><br/>The adding in of the illustrations and the decorative elements breaks things up a bit and makes it a pseudo-illuminated manuscript, but over-all I'm happy with the way it looks.<br/><br/>But how does it read? Does the density make it more difficult to read? Is it hard to look-up and reference rules and such?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231664/#Comment_231664" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T09:56:22+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  9:56AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeremy,<br/><br/>Honestly, I didn't pick it up at GenCon because I had trouble finding the core elements of the text.

It's got pretty healthy margins, and the numerous indented examples help to lighten things up. The illustrations ("illuminations") are perfect (no clip art. hurrah!). I'd say it's about on par with "Don't Rest your Head" in terms of the impression of the text on the page--perhaps not quite as much leading, but more befitting of the translation of a scholarly tome.<br/><br/>That said, it hasn't really been a book that I tried to just "flip through". I more or less have just read it straight through a couple of times. Perhaps it gives a better impression upon reading versus scanning. It's very well organized and leads naturally from high level concepts into details. <br/><br/>As an aside, CF's implementation of Aspects is what finally got me over my inability to grok the implementation of aspects in various Fate-based games.

Some of my favorites include: early Spanish Reconquesta up to about the period of El Cid especially.  Early Norman England, aka Ivanhoe times.  Early Hundred Years War featuring the Black Prince, or Palestine in between the 1st and 2nd or 2nd or 3rd crusades.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of these period feature the clash of cultures.  Relatively newly emplaced nobles trying to hold on or expand their holdings.  And a great mix of politics and fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there's plenty of online sources that will give you broad overviews and bibliographies for deeper reading.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231756/#Comment_231756" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T12:18:14+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 12:18PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2009 12:24PM by Jeremy Keller.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's very nice to hear, John.

If I've had a hard time answering it, it's perhaps because it's the reverse of how I've approached the game.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Chronica Feudalis is a game about human conflict. The skills come in four different categories each aligned with a particular conflict type: combat, parley, chase, and subterfuge. The tool list really focuses on tools that can be utilized somehow in conflict. Each mentor, no matter how much of a non-combatant they may appear to be, teaches three skills that relate to conflict. The advancement system encourages getting into conflict. Human versus human conflict with all the consequences that entails.<br/><br/>It's not that the game is the perfect game for the medieval setting, it's that I feel the medieval setting makes such a great setting for highlighting the brutal things people do to each other with plenty of adverse factions and vectors for starting wars and rivalries. Not that setting was an after thought, it was always a consideration in the design of the game. From mentors, to the skill list, to the way tools are weighted into the resolution system, to the way that Ardor and Vigor feel like medieval concepts. But ultimately the history part is a backdrop to what I hope is solid game about adventure and drama.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231883/#Comment_231883" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T16:32:35+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  4:32PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know about the history buffs, but that answer makes me like the game even more, Jeremy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231949/#Comment_231949" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T21:16:52+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  9:16PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm thinking about using <i>Chronica Feudalis</i> for an adventure set in the middle of the First Crusade.

The important thing was that the players really incorporated their mentors into their character concepts and defined each relationship: which mentors are parents, which mentors are a rung up on the social hierarchy, and so forth.<br/><br/>It turned into a nice little murder mystery. The only NPC that wasn't already statted out by the nature of being a mentor died in the first act. And the hijinks ensued from there.<br/><br/>There's a <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=473479" rel="nofollow">full AP report here</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1" title="forlorn1"><img alt="forlorn1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/n6SIEC3F01EX7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1">forlorn1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234941/#Comment_234941" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T18:46:57+00:00" title="September 30, 2009  6:46PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sigh...

Quite the accomplishment for my atrophied brain.  The text is incredibly tight in my opinion.  Congrads to both you, Jeremy, and your editor.  It is a joy to read.<br/><br/>I really like the fact that all 4 subsystems use the same base mechanic, and that the skills are broken down into sets for each subsystem.  And of course Aspects make everything better.<br/><br/>I will likely be using it later in the month to run a (blasphemous) Mouseguard game for some folks who are taken with Savage Worlds but have an active dislike for BW.  And since the mice are really just tiny knights anyway, the fit should be pretty good.<br/><br/>It also calls to me to do a 1066 Norman invasion scenario.  Maybe by Dreamation.<br/><br/>If my game actually happens I'll try to send you some AP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234944/#Comment_234944" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-30T19:01:13+00:00" title="September 30, 2009  7:01PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ran the second session of a CF game over irc yesterday.

I feared the narration would be dense and chalk full of antiquated language, but it was not (the translation I read was very accessible). That helped give me the courage to write CF with a similar conceit. So I take this as quite a complement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
