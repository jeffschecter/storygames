I'm trying not to plan too much for the first session, but I know I want to start the PCs on a trek through the deep desert. I'm planning to ask them a few questions toward the beginning of the game, like, "What hazardous and possibly foolhardy quest has brought you so deep into the Sea of Sand?" <br/><br/>I want to start the game with action, though, and I thought a sandstorm would be cool. But how do I do that? Custom move? Could any of you maybe help me think through this?<br/><br/>According to some quick research, sandstorms can... deal damage (abrading the skin), destroy your supplies (do I need to be more specific on that one?), cause blindness (if sand gets in your eyes), get in your lungs and suffocate you, bury you alive, and impair visibility (causing you to get lost). Bear Grylls (<span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-3Yl6pLk90fk?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Yl6pLk90fk"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/3Yl6pLk90fk/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span>) says suffocation and blindness are the two major concerns.<br/><br/>Another point is that I want to give them a chance to escape the storm... first they'll see it on the horizon, moving toward them quickly (soft move). They *might* be able to outrun it, at least long enough to get to a rock formation in the distance (where other dangers might perhaps await).<br/><br/>Any ideas?

I'd suggest starting with a dungeon; perhaps already in it. Then, if they have to trek through it to get back to the Steading, a sand storm might be appropriate.<br/><br/>Maybe write up a <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=2204.0" rel="nofollow">Dungeon Starter</a>?<br/><br/>I say this because it's your first time running it. So, yeah! Sandstorms! Keep that tucked away for when it comes up. But just follow the rules on page 175. Which means that you should like read about deserts too. Maybe the Crusades? Cool archeological stuff in deserts? What kinda monsters live in deserts? What are the locals gonna be like? <br/><br/>That shit is gonna come up so daydream about it a bit, and sack wikipedia for plausible info and ideas. <br/><br/>But like this "there's gonna be a sandstorm" and "I want to give them a chance to escape it" and "first this'll happen, then that" talk is gonna wreck your game and make not fun. <br/><br/>Do exactly what it tells you to do in the First Session chapter. Which means that where the players all start is a pretty collaborative process. Having a few dungeon maps and some strong imagery about deserts is all you need. Don't worry about planning events or set pieces. <br/><br/>And oh man do not worry about Fronts until the second session at the earliest.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kurisu" title="kurisu"><img alt="kurisu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kurisu">kurisu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408610/#Comment_408610" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-09T23:08:54+00:00" title="March  9, 2013 11:08PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I was also thinking there could be a rock formation concealing caves inhabited by the mysterious Fremen-like sand goblins... <br/><br/>Or perhaps the PCs have been sent to investigate trouble in the Sultan's spice mines?<br/><br/>But I still want to figure out how to do a sandstorm.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kurisu" title="kurisu"><img alt="kurisu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kurisu">kurisu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408611/#Comment_408611" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-09T23:17:35+00:00" title="March  9, 2013 11:17PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Orlando, why is it better to start in a dungeon?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408612/#Comment_408612" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-09T23:55:21+00:00" title="March  9, 2013 11:55PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few reasons: you start as close to the fun stuff as possible (combat, exploration, danger, weirdness!) and the party is already together, and like, First-time, first-session, it's hard to go wrong with a dungeon. It's easy, it's manageable, it's familiar.<br/><br/>You totally don't have to start in one though! Start where ever makes sense for the party and the characters. That's something you won't know until you get there. <br/><br/>So, yeah, Fremen-goblins, sure, and a Sultan and spice mines! Cool. Make one of <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B654TXP1tdnxOWUyMTJlZDYtZTNmZC00NTI3LWI5NTUtYzFmYTA3NjY2YTBh/edit?hl=en_US" rel="nofollow">these</a> for the desert. Seriously. <br/><br/>Then, like, during character creation be like, so, does anyone know the desert goblins? Who's an exslave from the mines? Escaped from the Sultan's harem? Does the Sultan venerate the same gods as the Cleric? That sort of thing. <br/><br/>A plot and a kicker usually fall out of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kurisu" title="kurisu"><img alt="kurisu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kurisu">kurisu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408615/#Comment_408615" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-10T00:17:51+00:00" title="March 10, 2013 12:17AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you!

Then the players must either make a player move to avoid/thwart the doom or to acquire the opportunity. That back and forth is the whole game. GM move. Player move. GM move. Player move. <br/><br/>"Separate them" and "take their stuff" also seem very sandstorm appropriate.<br/><br/>I don't think you need a dungeon to start. If you want them in a sand storm, do it. That sounds awesome. Think up a hand full of sand storm issues that can be phrased ways that are likely to induce player action, describe one of them, and ask "what do you do?" And you've got yourself a game.<br/><br/>Maybe ask a lot of questions about the characters' goals if they make it out of this storm. Maybe have them talk  important places on the map beyond the storm. When the winds subside, you'll have plenty of ideas for what comes next. <br/><br/>I feel like I'd definitely engineer a risky camel rescue in a sandstorm scenario. :P<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408664/#Comment_408664" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-10T14:10:51+00:00" title="March 10, 2013  2:10PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe they're all stuck in a palace during a sandstorm in the middle of a coup.

That's great. Here's an example of a storm-related front I ran recently; it's snow rather than sand, but it works similarly.

I was totally considering using Darude.<br/><br/>Anyway, here's what happened: we started in a forest. Yeah, I know. We started making characters, and as the guys were filling out their chosen sheets they started talking about how they were in a forest and how they had met each other, with the ranger having rescued the fighter and the dwarf cleric from a caravan that had been attacked by goblins. Something about the way the character sheets are set up, with the bonds and everything, just naturally led to that happening. And I was fine with it--I started asking them a bunch of questions about their bonds and before I knew it, we were off and running into the action of the game. <br/><br/>I guess if I had really wanted to do the desert thing, I should have said so before I even passed out the character sheets. Oh well--now I know. But the game went really well and I will post about it in Bite Sized AP. I am definitely keeping this desert sandstorm thing in the back of my mind for future use, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
