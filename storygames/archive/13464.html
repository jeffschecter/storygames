The SMBW units look like large and burly garbage truck. The operators toss dead bodies inside, and this, well, <i>things</i> come out of the other end. The Soviet soldiers call them <i>grusninki</i>, ghastly little creatures. They are smallish (~1 meter high) agglomerates of human organs, highly mobile and semi-sentient. They are usually set to storm the enemy as cannon fodder. When enough of them are present, they can cause a stampede. The grusninki are directed by certain radio signals transmitted by the operators.<br/><br/>In the battlefield, the presence of an MBW unit means that a unit of dead soldiers can be used completely neutralize an enemy squad or charge at a strategic location. Sometimes, no dead soldiers are available. Sometimes, they are created on the spot, prior to the beginning of the battle. When supplies are short, the soldiers aren't even given the courtesy of bullet to the chest prior being dumped inside the MBW.<br/><br/>In a civilian setting, the MBW units are notoriously easy to camouflage, and civilians, being civilians, are notoriously easy to kill. This means that unless the controlling units are all destroyed, an army of grusninki will grow to massive proportions.<br/><br/>So yeah, I guess this puts them in the Zombskis category.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rune" title="Rune"><img alt="Rune" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rune">Rune</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303676/#Comment_303676" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-08T10:21:03+00:00" title="December  8, 2010 10:21AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh God.

A minor theme would be the idea that the Soviets don't really have the esoteric knowhow and patience to get up to anything fancy here. Sort of a pathetic gloss on stolen German technology, they take what was considered failures and primitive basic chassis, gave the monstrous project a new suitably Communist name and started mass-production. Were I the GM, I'd probably go with a theme of let down expectations and banality of evil here; instead of dazzling the players with horrorful, unique images I'd have the SMBW simply be your basic Romero zombies controlled by means of electric whips or such. Laughably crude and not even that effective militarily in any normal conditions, but still deployed by the proud bureaucrats keen to prove their cachet in the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P" title="Adrian P"><img alt="Adrian P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P">Adrian P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303754/#Comment_303754" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-08T23:36:46+00:00" title="December  8, 2010 11:36PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some really, really cool ideas here - I think Anton may be the win, but I'm not sure if he'll have the effect I'm looking for - he may be too urbanely surreal.

As panic began to set in and the first incidents of Soviet weapons hitting British shores by way of insertion flights ( and other means) became known, alll sorts of rumors of monstrous "Fifth Columnist" activity made the rounds.<br/><br/>At the same time, the political unreliables interned in the industrial and public housing buildings of the Isle of Dogs began agitating for better conditions and making other demands. Some began demonstrating openly, getting into street fights with the ad-hoc army and police units cobbled together to guard them and keep them contained.<br/><br/>The end result was an atrocity. Rumors persist that in fact, some sort of Sov Weapons actually were deployed into that neighborhood. Perhaps there were actually some sort of upgraded Fifth Columnists actually captured in the round ups of communists and union organizers.<br/><br/>All that is really known in the end is that some sort of riot occured and began spreading. Police and Army personnel panicked and wiped out the entire area.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P" title="Adrian P"><img alt="Adrian P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P">Adrian P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303921/#Comment_303921" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-10T12:04:13+00:00" title="December 10, 2010 12:04PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>The Sov Bio-Weapons are real and ghastly, but the whole thing about the incident at The Isle of Dogs is a total lie..</blockquote>\nYou know, that sounds a whole lot more likely than the advertised 'victory'. Would make a pretty awesome discovery in a game - a SSG team looking for abandoned Soviet tech in the Isle of Dogs, finding none, and constantly getting redirected and sent on wild goose chases by officials trying to keep the atrocity covered up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
