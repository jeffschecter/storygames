Post in this thread or send me an e-mail if you want to.<br/><br/>If you GM an event that actually happens, you get at least 1 RinCoin, each is worth $5 at any vendor in the Con, or which can be redeemed for materials at our prize table. As an enthusiast GM I have never gone to a RinCon and not left with a net profit.  Yes, that's right. We will pay you, the GM (or game organizer, for GM-less games), to come and run games at RinCon.<br/><br/>Post questions here, whisper me with ideas here or shoot me an e-mail at jasondcorley at yahoo dot com. (I will have a RinCon address soon for official stuff, but it seems silly for me to worry about that with you folk.)<br/><br/>We have a smoking deal with the hotel, they are really cool to us, so if you're coming, you can get a good deal.  If you can't afford even the smoking deal at the hotel, e-mail me, we'll find something.<br/><br/>See you there!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284681/#Comment_284681" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T14:55:17+00:00" title="August  6, 2010  2:55PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After hearing how awesome this was last year, I'll definitely be attending with games ready to roll.

To us, that means you, the GM, are a volunteer providing 4 hours of programming. Thus you are entitled to 2 RinCoins for each game session that actually happens.  What is a RinCoin? Well, it's a little plastic coin that can be redeemed at any vendor at the con for $5.  Yes, that's right, if you preregister for RinCon ($20), and run 2, count them, 2 RPGs, your attendance will be <i>completely comped</i>.  Not a discount, not a "special GM's rate", fuck that, you will be comped into the con like a fucking VIP.  If you run more than 2 sessions, you will walk away from RinCon <i>with a profit.</i> <br/><br/>And furthermore, RinCoins can be used to purchase books at our prize table. Last year I walked away with a $40 White Wolf book for 2 RinCoins, so they can be worth even more than five dollars.<br/><br/>But that's not all, that's not good enough for me, because I'm not going to rest until we have the best RPG setup ever.  I've set up three "tracks" for game experiences that are going to be featured at RinCon:<br/><br/>* Play with the Creator. This includes not just what it did last year, but, if I can swing it, will also including playing a game with the creator <i>also playing</i>, not organizing or running the game. <br/><br/>* Lovecraftiana.  Chaosium has been a big supporter of RinCon, and as I noted above, last year, we had a ridiculous overflow of Call of Cthulhu players. This table won't exclusively be Call of Cthulhu, though, I intend to run a Cthulhutech game, I want someone to do the Penny Cthulhu scenario, and also Trail of Cthulhu and maybe even Pokethulu!  Anything even remotely Lovecraftian will work at this table.<br/><br/>* Classic Gaming.  That's from 1977-1992, the first 15 years of the hobby.  Dig out those crates and fish around in the shed, show these young kids how it was done back in the day.<br/><br/>If you run a game on any of these tracks (and I'm working on adding more tracks, these are the ones I'm confident I can fill tables with), you will get <b>three</b> RinCoins instead of two. Oh my god, do you know how fucking insane that is?  Run a Call of Cthulhu scenario and you're almost all the way comped.  More than comped if you get a good prize at the prize table!<br/><br/>This is completely crazy.  Take advantage of this before they realize I'm giving away the farm this year!<br/><br/>Also, game registration/creation should be up and running on the website soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293560/#Comment_293560" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-15T23:07:26+00:00" title="September 15, 2010 11:07PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey RinCon attendees, I'm looking for a roommate to split a room at the con.
