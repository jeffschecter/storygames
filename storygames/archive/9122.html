Is the ability to capture the spirit of an age (or a subculture of an age) the most important contributing factor to success in a game?<br/><br/>I wonder about another thing though: to what extent, if any, is the gaming market shrinking (figures, citations)?  Does making beginners' games necessarily mean that more complex games will be played?  Or does that matter?<br/><br/>As an example, the Wii has expanded the market for video games.  But even though I like playing videogames, this doesn't really affect me; people willing to play Wii specific games (Fit, Sports, Etc) as new users are still not interested in playing the games that I play (jrpgs, tactical games, the odd FPS).  And I'm not terribly interested in playing the Wii games either.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm saying that I'm not altruistic enough on behalf of story-gaming that I am happy to help it achieve success by creating games that I would prefer not to play if this does not lead to getting players that want to play the kinds of games I would prefer to play (and I apologize for that sentence).  It's not that I don't like these people, these non-gamers; perhaps we can play boardgames or knit, or watch movies or go backpacking.  But I suppose the interest in making special games for beginners would make more sense to me if I thought that playing story-games was an end in itself, by definition more satisfying than other social activities and independent of whether the system or content was of interest to me.<br/><br/>Too many unknowns.

Distribution via the web has totally transformed the field, so the audience for this sort of essay is now, well, everyone. But back when I wrote it, it was for Steve Jackson, Robin Laws, Jon Tweet, Sam Chupp and all the rest of those cats who actually had some say in what games saw the light of day. In fact this went into The Oracle, which was Lou Prosperi's effort at maintaining the terrific first steps made by Interactive Fiction (which, also, wasn't really for the masses back then).<br/><br/>EDIT EDIT: I see it says 1999 but I'm sure I had drafted versions of this essay at various points prior. 1996 was at the top of my full-time writing/designing phase, so it makes sense that my first drafts happened after my Big Meltdown. <br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201854/#Comment_201854" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-13T15:29:51+00:00" title="April 13, 2009  3:29PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What do you think of it now with the passing of ten years and a different environment?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201855/#Comment_201855" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-13T15:35:30+00:00" title="April 13, 2009  3:35PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I was on the mark.
