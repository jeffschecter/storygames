So if you're interesting in being on a podcast with (I hope) some loyal listeners who want some pure gaming content.<br/><br/>A couple of things to keep in mind: <br/>This is not a podcast for the easily offended<br/>I'm in Eastern time<br/>This would probably be over Skype or some other such thing.<br/>I suck at GMing, but can do it if necessary.<br/>I'm looking for a group of about 3-5 including myself<br/><br/>So if you wish to be a host, either talk to me on here or send me an email to lbtddbtd@gmail.com.<br/><br/>Happy gaming all                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
