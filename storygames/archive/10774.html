Looking down, I had a flashback where I saw my wife talking to the plant foreman - she wanted to know if I could be released for the rest of the day. She looked serious. I shook off the memory and went into the trunk room, where the smell of sewage made me nod in sympathy for whoever the poor guy who had to clean it last was - it used to be my job. I went through the service door into the control room, and the memories of good, productive times made me immediately forget about whatever it was in the trunk room. Anyway, I got a hold of myself and went out into the scrap room. On top of a pile of rusting scrap there was a brand new polo shirt, which totally terrified me. It was the first evidence I'd seen of anyone actually here, and the new newness of the shirt against all the decaying remnants shook me.<br/><br/>I got a hold of myself and went into the furnace room, and had another strong memory - the foreman coming to congratulate me that I was going to be a father! Oh man, I could remember the look on his face when I went to hug him. I settled for a strong handshake. It was great news! My wife and I had had a hard time conceiving, after all. But then I remembered where I was, and I kept going. Next I checked out the coil room, and something made me think of the "happy giraffe" that had been my daughters favorite toy. I didn't know if I could go through with what I was here to do. But I kept going anyway, I couldn't stop now.<br/><br/>I went up the decaying fire escape ladder to the top floor, and emerged onto the work line. There was an old broken plastic train set on top of a dirty mattress in the corner, and it reminded me of how, when I was my daughters age, I had wanted to be a train conductor SO BAD. I swallowed, crossed the room and started up the ladder to the roof, but the door out was rusted shut. When I came back down, I turned and saw her. She hadn't been trying to hide or anything, just sitting there half-hidden by shadows, and when I saw her she smiled, but it was all plasticy like she was copying those magazines that her mother had always had lying around. And I knew that my daughter, my true daughter, was gone, replaced by this faded thing, and even though my heart was beating fit to burst, I reached into my pocket and...well, I did what I had to do. And now I'm staring into this barrel and I think I know what the last thing I have to do is. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>So I obviously embellished and fleshed it out a bit, especially at the end, but I think you can see where I was guided by the game. It's a pretty sad story I got there, which is totally ok. I liked how pushed my motivations around. I started out with the idea that I was trying to save my daughter from something, but one of the rooms made me think I had a less noble mission and it spiraled from there.<br/><br/>My main mechanical question is what happens when you draw an Up as your last card (which I did)? I just treated the last room I'd draw before it as the last room, but switched my edge letter to the one where I had put the Up.<br/><br/>I had to puzzle out for myself what you meant by "condition" and "life status" in the details instructions. Also, I totally didn't notice that there were more than 10 fill-in-the-blanks on that list, so I ended up with a much bigger detail deck! I don't know if that matters, I can't imagine it does.<br/><br/>There's four endings, right? So replay value is pretty limited, though it could be expanded by having more cards, or maybe being able to go back through rooms or something? I don't know if that's a concern.<br/><br/>I also thought that this could be cool for two people to play, each with an individual detail deck, and each entering from a different part of the plant but able to go into a room that was already played rather than draw a new card. I imagine that would require a slightly larger plant deck and some kind of interaction rule (though as simple as "if you enter a room with the other player in it, each of you draws a detail and incorporates it into a short discussion). If you wanted to take the game that way, of course.<br/><br/>I hope that's helpful!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239089/#Comment_239089" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-25T21:42:06+00:00" title="October 25, 2009  9:42PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 25, 2009 9:51PM by whiteknife.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played it. I worked out a character that was pretty interesting, and I sort of felt the flow. I thought it was a bit short to develop much, and while the descriptions of the machinery were sort of unerving I had a hard time properly picturing a lot of them (from not hanging around in plants ever I suppose).<br/><br/>I did end up with an interesting story though. I had creepy music on, and I drew an up card immediately. I pictured my character as a sort of woodsman type guy, who lost his daughter in this weird abandoned gun factory that he was really distrustful of. I kind of had a whole "false memories" thing going on thanks to instruction 19 and ending 22. It created a sort of "uncompleted mystery" type narrative for me, which I thought was a pretty cool effect.<br/><br/>Mechanics wise I think I only got the less likely option once (on my last card) so that was that. <br/><br/>All that aside though, the best part by far was instruction 21. <br/><br/>Brilliant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239106/#Comment_239106" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-26T04:35:24+00:00" title="October 26, 2009  4:35AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 26, 2009 5:44AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys, that's really good feedback and very valuable to me.  <br/><br/>Were you dissatisfied with the endings?  They are really the only place where you don't have a hand in what's going on - you are told something for the first time.  I worry that it is either unnecessary or anticlimactic.<br/><br/>Nathan, I love the idea of a two-player variant.  I'd only gotten as far as "author details for each other and swap them" (which I think would be very effective and powerful).  I don't know how concerned I should be about replay value - turning the endings into open-ended questions would help with that, and I could buff it out with further detail and complexity, but I'm not sure it really supports that.  What do you think?<br/><br/>Also, thanks for the confusion about ending the game on an Up card - that sentence got cut off on "The Last Card" instructions.

Took about 10 minutes to skim over the instructions again and make the cards, and it took about 40 minutes to actually play (i was also taking notes on each step, both to be able to give you feedback and because it's easier for me to visualize something if i write it down).<br/><br/>The ending wasn't anticlimactic, per se, but I did feel like it was a little abrupt. I didn't really resolve it in my head until I sat down to write my report, above. I feel like the endings as they currently exist actually should happen shortly before the "real" ending - I'd like a chance to incorporate that hard stop of "this is how you feel" into my conception of the character and story. Part of the abruptness was also that I was prepared to keep going, and it was the end. The game could be longer! Though I see no reason there couldn't be a variable-length dial whereby you only use as many rooms as you have time to play - unless that messes up the math.<br/><br/>I thought I had was that maybe the Up cards have their own descriptions, and each of those is something like how the endings currently are. "As you ascent to the next level of the Plant, you hear her voice laughing and a door slamming somewhere above you. Your heart rises into your throat." or whatever.<br/><br/>I don't know if replay value is particularly important, I was more bringing it up as something for you to think about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239135/#Comment_239135" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-26T08:15:40+00:00" title="October 26, 2009  8:15AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, E, you could play by cutting up squares of paper or something as well.

Seven interrogative moments, three "refreshes" that also have some mechanical weight in that they privilege the less likely outcome in the following room.  I hope there's some thematic resonance with the notion of climbing higher and higher as well that may color narration.  Like in your game, nathan, you found your daughter on the roof of the highest point in the plant.  <br/><br/>It'd be easy to tweak it to be longer or shorter by controlling the number of plant cards.  Each card requires three new sections, which are no big deal to author.  That'd aid replay a lot, so if replay emerges as something people want, I'll add some, maybe double them and have you shuffle as many as you want to play with, from 3 to 16.<br/><br/>I like the idea of offering some kind of player-authored final section.  I'll think on that.

I played two games this afternoon in my local coffee shop. Rules reading took 10 minutes, and each game took 10 minutes. I play fast.<br/><br/>Figuring out what the edge letters are was weirdly confusing. I kept drawing a new card and playing it, thinking I needed an edge to my next room. Then I thought I was the edge I passed through to get to this room (which makes more sense). I accidentally skipped a room due to this confusion. <br/><br/>Going "up" felt thematically compelling, but didn't mesh with the fiction .I kept finding myself in these heavy equipment rooms that felt like they wouldn't be high up in a factory, but rather on the ground floor. That's a pretty subjective observation, I know.<br/><br/>Room 19 felt a bit weird at first. I thought you were telling me that the previous room never happened. Isn't it odd to remove a part of the story, when there's so little story to begin with? Then I realized that this is more of a psychological statement. It's not that it never happened; it's that I shake it off as though it never happened. The fact that I keep the anger/fear I learned is a good hint of this.<br/><br/>I'm a little at a loss to adequately describe what happens when you play this game. Game play produces a skeletal framework, over which a character (the protagonist) and a story (his/her life) can be hung. Your imagination fills in the gaps. I like this a lot. It's like reading a short-short story. The best part is what isn\u2019t said.<br/><br/>I played twice. Both games gave me something interesting. In the first game, I got the picture of a bitter, defeated man whose hopes and dreams have died along with the town and the plant around him. But he finds redemption in caring for his daughter. Like him and the town she's hurt, but unlike them, her injuries can be treated. <br/><br/>The second story was bleaker, though right up until the ending it felt like it might have a positive outcome. When a man's brother dies working in the dangerous, poorly maintained factory, he finds himself comforting and eventually marrying the brother's lover. Except that's the story he tells himself, and it's not true at all. The truth is far more brutal and sad than that. And he made the wrong choice.<br/><br/>The difficult part with the ending is taking a determinate end and making it match the skeleton of a story you\u2019ve already assembled. The more skeleton you give, the harder this becomes. Right now the length seems about right. If you decide to make this longer, I wouldn't add more than 1-2 rooms. Alternately, you could add more rooms, but take some out every time you play. That would also add re-play value.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240487/#Comment_240487" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-04T13:42:01+00:00" title="November  4, 2009  1:42PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2009 1:42PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Tony, that's really useful feedback.  I'm glad you enjoyed it.  <br/><br/>I feel like the game is at the sweet spot regarding length, but I'm going to add three rooms and let the player adjust for available time and commitment - make up between four and ten plant cards, and number them anything between one and ten, not overlapping.  This adds some replay value, too - six new questions, three new areas to explore.<br/><br/>The absolute/determinist ending still sort of gnaws at me - it feels like an arbitrary constraint.  I'm not sure what I'd change, though.  Leaving outcome completely up to the player is no good, and "You have a SEMI-POSITIVE outcome" seems even weaker.<br/><br/>I'll adjust the language at 19 to make it clear, and I'm already working on revising the instructions for how edges mate and what to do with them.  I'd love to hear some alternate terms or ideas for how to communicate that.<br/><br/>Thanks again!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
