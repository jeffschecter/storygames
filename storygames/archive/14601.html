These game mechanics are tools which cover way more than any group will likely ever use. The GM is the master craftsman, who will select which of those tools too use, filtered through a lens of Best Practices. Some tools will be used more frequently than others. The GM, as Master Craftsman will occasionally alter or add tools as they see fit depending on their own set of best practices. Best practices come from both GM advice (perhaps appearing in said toolkit rulebook or other sources) and a feedback loop of response due to the reaction of the other participants.<br/><br/>System Matters<br/>The selection of tools + selection of best practices is what the Actual System is in play. This is different from system=mechanics alone. If you were to examine a group's use of best practices + mechanics and the frequecy with which they were used, you could isolate them, formailze them, and write them down. <br/><br/>Why is this good? <br/>You could make a vastly more focussed text, which would then allow you to share just that. You could cut right to the heart of a given sort of play experience and come closer to replicating it between groups.<br/><br/>Why is this bad?<br/>Added responsibility to learn multiple rule-kits for different effects, with burden for this being shared out more amongst the play group.<br/><br/>As for folks knowing what they like, per Jason's post, I believe that folks absolutely know what they like. <br/><br/>For the vast majority of character players, what they like is participating in a kind of verbal-costume party where the person hosting and organizing the party has put some limits on the theme of the verbal-costumes the invitees can create and has a bag of party theme related games to play and party theme related activities to particpate in.<br/><br/>If the themed verbal costume party goes really well, they want to do it it again and again. Their verbal costumes will become more evolved and intricate, and they expect the party host to likewise make the party themed activities and games more involved or challenging and more geared to their evolving verbal costume.<br/><br/>What's in it for the Party Host: Dude, you have people who love the parties you throw! They love it so much that they keep begging you to throw more! And they're really into it, even suggesting ideas to you by the way they constantly evolve their costumes.<br/><br/>The downside? Most of them will never, ever bother to throw a party of their own. For some, it's because they are just plain having too much fun at yours. For others, especially those who join later parties, they're just plain intimidated by what they see and don't realize just how basic things really start out. They're also likely intimidated by the thought of trying to please the other party-goers who regularly attend your intricate shindigs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/otherdoc" title="otherdoc"><img alt="otherdoc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://otherdoc.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/jimsquared32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/otherdoc">otherdoc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332466/#Comment_332466" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T08:48:03+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  8:48AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This strikes me as something that depends a lot on the context.<br/><br/>Saying "it's all about the GM" on the surface appears to deny the involvement of the players, but I'm assuming this kind of thing is discussed mostly by players who are more into the kinds of games where the GM does most (if not all) of the narration.<br/><br/>I can understand someone saying that it's all about the GM if what they really mean is, "If the Game Master sucks, the game won't be any good no matter WHAT system you're playing." or conversely, "If the Game Master is great, the game will be good no matter WHAT system you're playing."  In this case, they're not really talking about the merits of a system but how much fun they'll have in a game.

That's what matters. Not arguing over terminology and voice and narrativism vs. storytelling, etc. For most people, role playing game means adventure game. People can't differentiate between those two terms because they are consumers first. Not connoisseurs first. They're not trained to (nor should they be).<br/><br/>System, to most gamers is "what kind of die do I roll." It has nothing to do with playing a game that feels like the world/story you are trying to invoke, i.e. Game X playing the way Game X is supposed to play and Game Y playing the way Game Y is supposed to play. People play Game A, the same way the play Game B. It just has different monsters and different treasure types. (Yes, that's overly contrived.)<br/><br/>But to illustrate my point\u2026<br/><br/>Scott Haring said something amazing once about a book he was reviewing. "Oh look, it's another world setting where they've changed the word "sword" to something I can't pronounce." I thought, then. And I still think it now, that this is the most important statement about the first 30 years of RPGs. Companies that are still make products like the "Lost World" books aren't seeing anything but the trees. And people arguing about syntax and system are only seeing the forest.<br/><br/>To use the above Cthulhu example, so long as the game play is about stemming the tide of madness, it doesn't matter what "system" you use.

All too often the system matters crowd are really arguing for a redefinition of terms, and I just don't see any value in that.<br/><br/>Usually therefore when I see someone argue that system matters I just move on. It's not worth my time. If the statement is that the actual rules used may impact play, that's a truism. If the statement is more than that it's usually a redefinition of the word system to something other than the normal usage, and I don't find semantics particularly helpful.<br/><br/>As a general rule, I assume that when people say something is true for them it is in fact true for them. So, when someone says that system doesn't matter I assume that's true for them. If I found that surprising I might try to learn why it was true, but I wouldn't assume that I was better at saying what matters to someone than they are themselves. If someone tells me they can immerse in character while playing Dogs (as someone once did) I assume that's true for them. I can't see how you could do that, but they're not me and I don't assume my truth is theirs.<br/><br/>The problem with the original post is it assumes the people speaking are wrong in what they say. I think that assumption ends conversations. If you assume they're right in what they say, that opens them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332479/#Comment_332479" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T10:05:35+00:00" title="June 30, 2011 10:05AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Some folks like playing in a way that prioritizes technique and player chemistry in such a way so that the mechanics of the game either don't matter or fade away, discarding anything that get's in the way of the techniques.<br/><br/>Such is life.</blockquote>\nQuite. Importantly, if in play your goal as a player is for the system to fade away, a system which matters - which makes a noticeable difference to play - is a problem. In that scenario system doesn't matter because when it does matter the system is discarded in favour of one that doesn't. Ironically of course that means that system does in fact matter since certain systems can get in the way of play, but they don't matter in the way the phrase usually means.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332480/#Comment_332480" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T10:07:34+00:00" title="June 30, 2011 10:07AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On a related note, I can't even play boardgames with my wife, because she's not interested in following the rules.

I was anti "System Matters" for a long time.  Till i thought about it.  Then i became very pro "System Matters," until i thought more about it.  Now i just see a whole lot of elements to the very specific games i play.  It's helped me understand what i want from gaming, what i want from a specific game, what i want from a group, and what i want from any group i sit with.  But most of all it's helped me know where to engage and where to abandon the 'system' of any game i play, depending on group, situation, and, heck, even my mood.<br/><br/>So, yeah, it sucks when people want to throw arguments around rather than explore what different perspectives can offer.  The only way i've gotten anything out of it is to try and ask questions.  Like you did at the start of this thread!

When you ask someone "why do you like this" they will give you an answer they are confident in but it may not really be true. If everyone knew why they really liked things the world would be awash in brilliance. <br/><br/>It's like feed back when play testing, you should almost never listen to what people tell you, should watch how they act. feelings change when they are expressed.<br/><br/>It is true that you should not argue with them though, unless for some reason that's what you like doing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332610/#Comment_332610" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T22:17:31+00:00" title="June 30, 2011 10:17PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's make T-shirts that say "I AM SYSTEM"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332612/#Comment_332612" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T23:42:49+00:00" title="June 30, 2011 11:42PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>BURN IN HELL CORLEY!!!</blockquote>\n<img alt="image" src="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/images/macro/fieldspunch.gif"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332642/#Comment_332642" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T06:25:50+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  6:25AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>I take from your original post that you sometimes see threads and you'd like to participate and help but you realize it won't be worth your time.</blockquote>Yep. This. <br/><br/>I want to play better games, run better games, and that means thinking more clearly about games.  If people want my advice for their games IRL, and they're my friends, then we talk for a long time and make sure we understand each other.  If I'm critiquing something they show me, I often have to explain some concepts so my advice makes sense.  <br/><br/>I like giving advice and stuff, and people tell me my advice is great, to the point that people seek me out for it.

That's a problem that arose because someone was being a bit of a pedantic dick.<br/><br/>Probably from the best of motives. Probably from an excess of enthusiasm for the game. God knows I'm not immune to being a pedantic dick myself (few of us are I suspect). But that doesn't feel to me like a system matters issue. I don't think those guys are saying you must run the rules as written precisely as they are written. I think they're just saying that what rules you choose and how you implement them as part of a larger framework of behaviour makes a real difference to play. <br/><br/>To be honest I always understood system matters as more of an issue for game designers than GMs and players. If you're designing a game with certain goals in mind, what will help achieve those goals? That might take you to considering the strict mechanics, the fluff, social rituals, tons of stuff. You have a goal and all that matters to how you achieve it. I don't think it's about how I struggle to remember the brawling rules in Space 1889 (which I do, and they're not even complex god help me).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332680/#Comment_332680" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T08:26:48+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  8:26AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: thadrine</cite>But, if they at least seem to understand what it is they like, then that is what they like.

I think that the line should be:  <b>"System does matter to me.  And here is why...</b>".  Now, you've put the target on yourself.  Not the other guy.  Taken a bit of the sting away.  And you've got a segue to why it matters to you.<br/><br/>for the record:  System DOES matter to me.  I want elegance and genre support out of my game systems.  I don't want to struggle through/past systems in order to get the vibe/feel the table wants.  But I can understand someone who wants to use D&amp;D 3rd ed for everything because that's what they know and they don't want to be bothered learning other games, other systems.  <br/><br/>As for not diagrams, no textbook.... I think it is really hard to point to some manifesto of "system matters" because system matters to different people for different reasons.  Although if there was to be a manifesto...

They only know what they are comfortable and familiar with.

I changed for a few reasons, but one of them was a desire for a break from fruitless arguments.<br/><br/>I'd find myself engaged in pointless theory wars. Arcane discussions about which I could get quite worked up, but about which I don't actually really care. So what was that all about?<br/><br/>Buggered if I know. It wasn't making me happier though. I post online because I want to talk about games. I want to share enthusiasm. I want to read about someone's cool Exalted game even if I don't like Exalted at all, and help someone else build their ideas for their Dogs game even though I don't particularly like Dogs either. I want, ideally, to share the love (but without hugging, I am British). I don't want to be some bullshit internet warrior.<br/><br/>So, routinely now I open threads, think of a response then walk away. Sometimes I write a response, then delete it. Occasionally I post a response, then come back later and delete it. It's not worth the hassle. I'm not an educator and nobody is asking me to educate them. If people want help that I can give they're competent to ask for it themselves.<br/><br/>I occasionally fail. On this very thread I discussed system matters, a topic which I have strong views on and yet don't actually care about. So it goes. But in response to the OP, yes, routinely I find myself seeing a discussion or where one is heading and I decide just to move on. I don't always manage it, but the times I do are the happier times. <br/><br/>Something may be wrong on the internet, but it doesn't need us to stay up to fix it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332704/#Comment_332704" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T08:59:16+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  8:59AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you go into a discussion thinking you're <i>explaining facts</i> to people, it's probably best to stay out anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332717/#Comment_332717" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T09:31:11+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  9:31AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2011 9:31AM by Joe_Beason.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ry, do you find it's just this issue that you're pulling back on, or a whole type of interactions?<br/><br/>I ask because I find myself becoming less interested in engaging in forum arguments in general, regardless of the type of forum or question at hand.  It's a mix of disinterest in arguing, less time to spend in forums, and a sense that there's a variety of situations where my opinion is not really needed, despite an urge to provide it.  <br/><br/>I think it depends on context, too.  "Systems doesn't matter" could be a topic, a vote, or a derailment, and my interest in engaging is going to be different for each.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332823/#Comment_332823" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T18:33:00+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  6:33PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ry</cite>But there's a bigger gap on the internet, and there aren't good (i.e. not TLDR) resources for closing that gap.</blockquote>\nI hear you, Ry!<br/><br/>But the optimist in me thinks: there must be a way to offer advice in a constructive and helpful way without getting into a bunch of nerd rage wars. After all, I myself benefited tremendously from advice from people on the internet, and my gaming life would not have been half as cool if they had decided to shut their mouths. It seems only right to return that service as much as possible: pass along good advice and smart ideas.<br/><br/>I really don't think it's impossible. I've seen lots of people do it well, including Vincent, Ralph, and Jason.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, staying away from certain terms is becoming more and more necessary, which makes the jargon much less useful. For instance, you'll find fewer and fewer people bring up "GNS" or specific Creative Agendas in online discussions, even those who still think in those terms. They set off some real rage for people, or at least some very real misunderstandings. <br/><br/>But you can still say, "Hey, it sounds like your game has this really cool thing where you try to one-up each other by moving around these tokens. Have you considered that this other rule might actually make that part less fun?" ... without saying, "Hey, so clearly you're writing an Incoherent game, partially based around Gamist Agendas. You need to remove Simulationist tendencies from this aspect of the System."<br/><br/>Anyway, I think it's worth the effort and entirely possible.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, like much about human comminucation (and especially online communication!), it is a difficult skill to acquire and maintain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332917/#Comment_332917" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-02T19:32:31+00:00" title="July  2, 2011  7:32PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.
