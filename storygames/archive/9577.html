I ran it.<br/><br/>Adam played the eponymous Lady.  Thomas played Cap'n Cyrus.  Aaron played the goblin Snargle.  The other PCs didn't exist.<br/><br/>Upon finding themselves locked up in a waiting room, Cyrus hatched a cunning plan for Natasha to fake a choking fit, getting them escorted back aboard the Owl in order to get her "medicine".  Snargle hid behind the door, stole the keys, and headed off in a different direction.  Splitting up the party early and often seems to be a theme with us.<br/><br/>Snargle poked his head in an adjoining cell and found a dozen goblin slaves awaiting execution, so of course he let them go.  And of course they just followed him around.<br/><br/>Back in the Owl, Cyrus tried to knock out their escort through repeated blows to the head, while Natasha tried to talk him into surrendering.  Cyrus won this round.<br/><br/>Snargle led his newly-acquired troops into the landing bay where they got into a big fight with Imperial guards.  About half of them died.<br/><br/>Cyrus and Natasha disembarked the Owl just in time to see a platoon of the Space Marines show up.  (Technically they were Sky Marines, but we called them Space Marines throughout.)  Natasha tried to command them to stand down, which didn't work so well, and they responded by shooting her.  Then she unleashed a lightning bolt on them, which fried most of them to bits.<br/><br/>The humans tried to order the goblin slaves around, but that didn't really work out for them.<br/><br/>Snargle told me he was waiting around for a cutter, so he could open the hatch.  Hunh.  So one wandered by.  A big clockwork mecha like a chainsaw on legs.  He climbed aboard and piloted it towards a hatch out of the bay, to cut it open, which he did.<br/><br/>Cyrus and Natasha eventually got up to the hull of the Hand of Sorrow, where Natasha started summoning this enormous solar-magical flare.  Cyrus notices one of the huge ship-to-ship guns traversing slowly towards them.<br/><br/>"Is there some way to get into the gun?"<br/>"Well, you could climb down the barrel."<br/>"I'll look for another way in."<br/><br/>He got into the turret and jammed the gun, while Natasha's spell completed and blew off the engines and most of the stern of the Hand of Sorrow.<br/><br/>They made their way back down to the bay, where the Owl was surrounded by burning fuel and dying people and such, and they made good their escape.<br/><br/><br/>Natasha decided she wanted to get a message off to Uriah, and it just so happened that Cyrus knew a guy over on Nightport, so off they went.  Natasha sent her message, which was kinda whiny and melodramatic and all "ooh I ran away from my fiance to be with you again etc etc."  But at least she got a response:<br/><br/>"If you are who you say you are, you should have known better."<br/><br/>Natasha didn't seem to like that all that much for some reason.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Cyrus and Snargle... just kinda flailed around a bit.  I dropped the ball a bit at this stage.  Eventually I figured out that, hunh, you guys hear word of a special slave auction coming up tonight.  Apparently they captured some nobles.  They'll be auctioning off Count Carlowe.<br/><br/>(A quick digression on slavery:  Goblins, as the native lifeforms being ruthlessly civilized by the Empire, are part of chattel slavery.  Humans get something closer to debt slavery.)<br/><br/>That got things back on track, and they eventually got their way into the auction site.  Natasha sorta hung out in a balcony box, while Snargle climbed out onto a catwalk, and Cyrus (eventually) headed back stage, to where the slaves were being kept, in the galaxy's worst green room.<br/><br/>Cyrus eventually found the enslaved Count Carlowe, who... looked and sounded and acted just like Ruby Rhod, the Chris Tucker character from The Fifth Element.  Cyrus eventually conned him into physical contact, and then warpblood-teleported him away onto the catwalk, beside Snargle.  Thomas was perhaps a bit too coy here; he could have been clearer about what he was trying to accomplish.<br/><br/>Cyrus ended up being shoved onto the stage as Count Carlowe, when... stormtroopers kicked in the door.  It's a raid!  People running, screaming, shots being fired, etc.<br/><br/>They eventually make their way to the roof of the building, where the hovering Hand of Terror ("How many Hands does this Emperor have?") blots out the night sky.  They run off to the Owl without much incident, and take off.  The Hand of Terror is apparently in pursuit, escorted by her usual compliment of TIE Fighters.<br/><br/>They're running and getting shot at and such, when... they hear a slow golf clap from behind them.  "Well done, Lady Blackbird, on your marvelous effort to 'rescue' me."  Count Carlowe is not such a buffoon after all!  Him and Natasha mince words for some time, to no significant effect.  He doesn't seem bothered that the Hand of Terror is trying to blow them out of the sky.  Eventually Cyrus tires of this and drags Carlowe down to the Brig.  Snargle cuts the engines and they drop on a ballistic trajectory into the acidic lower Blue.<br/><br/>They hear a bang, and, hunh, hey look, it's Count Carlowe flying off our port bow.  You don't see that every day.<br/><br/>At that point, Snargle decides it'd be a good time to restart the engines, and, with a crushing NINE SUCCESSES, he does so.  In light of his stupendous roll, I give him the option to suck Carlowe into the engines (or not.)  They're happy to see him become a surprised cloud of pink mist, and so it goes.<br/><br/>I already have some ideas of a few things to throw out there for the next session, including the name of someone who might be able to tell them how to get to Uriah's secret hideout.<br/><br/><br/>In general, the game played pretty well out of the box.  Running with only three PCs probably wasn't ideal, but I think we did alright.  About halfway through I got lazy and stopped telling the players what the difficulty was and just told them to roll; I was defaulting to around 2 or 3 obstacle.<br/><br/>I think the players might have been shorting themselves as far as taking rewards for Key-hitting, but maybe not.  I might just dump an advance or two on them at the start of the next session.  It feels like we're about halfway through the story.  Playing time of this session was about three hours.<br/><br/>The silliness factor was down compared to playing a gang of Kim Jong-il clones, which is probably good, and it was still a lot of fun all around.  Looking forward to our next session in a couple weeks.  Thanks for the game, John.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212423/#Comment_212423" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T14:40:20+00:00" title="June 15, 2009  2:40PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was key-baiting constantly, but nearly every time I would get into a situation where my Nobility could be an advantage (or a hindrance) I would either get what I wanted without having to be imperious or special, or the Nobility-related problem I had set up would resolve itself before it ever really became a real problem.<br/><br/>Similarly, it was never clear if I had fooled anyone when I was trying to lie low. I never had to roll to maintain my disguise. People either just bought it (in which case I took my XP) or didn't. At least once I took XP for successfully fooling someone (Carlowe) only to find out that I hadn't actually fooled him. Not sure whether I should give that XP back.<br/><br/>One thing I noticed, just based on fortune, is that every time I tried to take command, the dice would abandon me, but whenever I wanted to cast Blowshituppus! I inevitably got 4-6 successes.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what the intended rate of advances is for <i>LB</i>. I scored one advance over the course of the game, so I suspect that's probably about right.<br/><br/>The not telling us what the difficulty was (even in general terms) caused a fair bit of confusion, because we didn't know how many personal dice to risk on the activity. It makes resource management really tough when you don't even have a vague sense of how likely success is. Furthermore, it meant we didn't tend to know if we'd succeeded or failed, which means we didn't know if we were gaining personal dice or not. I noticed several times after one of us would roll, we'd sit there, hesitantly, waiting for the announcement of the outcome.<br/><br/>I think being a bit stricter might work well, too: let the high difficulty numbers burn up our personal dice and force us into refresh scenes. We only had one refresh scene through the entire game, but I think that a lot of the meat is in that aspect.<br/><br/>I suspect I saw this somewhere else, long before I ever played the game, but I think some explicit element of degree of success would be nice, so that rolling nine success would mean something concrete within the game, rather than just being really cool. In fact, something like <i>Wilderness of Mirrors</i>, or better still, <i>Houses of the Blooded</i> where better success gives a greater degree of narrative control might work brilliantly here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212476/#Comment_212476" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T17:04:12+00:00" title="June 15, 2009  5:04PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did you do the Mountain Witch/asking questions thing, with letting the players develop the setting?  <br/>In my online game, some of the players have really dug that and some, not so much. <br/><br/>It's interesting how some setting elements, like the goblins and the empire, vary so much between games; we figured out in <i>our </i>Wild Blue that there are goblins serving as irregular shock troops in the empire.

I briefly considered doodling a blackbird image on the Lady somewhere, like a pendant or cloak-pin, but then I realized I didn't know what they looked like! I was also trying to figure out what sorts of behaviour traits might earn a noble family the name "Blackbird", so I looked it up on Wikipedia. Ta-daaa.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I based her more-or-less on the character nicknamed "The Blackbird" in the Bernard Cornwell "Grail Quest" trilogy.<br/><br/>Oh, also, our goblins are slaves I think more out of lack of organization than anything. Aaron's shapeshifting went from very small to very big with a wide variety of utility in between. Although I think he said he kept basically the same strength regardless of size.

This was relevant because they'd just fed Count Carlowe, a powerful mage, through the port engine nacelle.<br/><br/>They figured out that a big sky squid was approaching, and tried the usual things:  running away, shooting it in the eye, etc.  Then they tried the usual unusual thing: flying into its gaping beak.  They decided it was better than the alternative, once they noticed it was trying to mate with them.<br/><br/>Turns out being swallowed whole by a sky squid isn't all that bad.  Snargle had to contend with some giant stomach flukes -- big flat worms about a yard long -- but he made quick work of them.<br/><br/>Natasha mind-melded with the squid, using the flukes as a material component, and calmed it down.  They eventually flew back out its mouth.<br/><br/>Fun Goblin Fact:  Goblin females are non-sentient fungal masses.  Goblin males rub up against them, and then a new goblin polyp forms on their body and eventually pops off.<br/><br/>Natasha remembered the estate house of a nearby family friend (whose name escapes me) and they hung out there for a while.  <br/><br/>Cyrus remembered who would know the secret of how to get to Uriah Flint's hideout -- the pirate queen Captain Jezebel Flint, his estranged wife.  Who also had a fling or two with Cyrus.  And who currently terrorized the skyways aboard The Vagina Dentata.<br/><br/>They met up in a pleasant summer dance.  I tried very hard to get Jezebel into a swordfight with Natasha, but it was not meant to be.  They didn't like each other much, though.<br/><br/>Jezebel:  Of course, I cannot just turn this valuable Secret over to you for simply nothing.  What do you offer for it?<br/><br/>Cyrus:  Snargle.<br/><br/>Jezebel:  Accepted.<br/><br/>Cyrus:  Ummm...<br/><br/>So that was fun.  Cyrus eventually weaseled his way out of it and Snargle declined joining Jezebel's crew of his own free will.  Cyrus was left owing her an unspecified favour.<br/><br/>Later in the evening, Natasha got hammered and decided it'd be a good idea to sneak aboard The Vagina Dentata.  Snargle tagged along.  Once aboard, they got a little lost and stumbled into a large cargo hold.  Full of zombies.  She figured out that was bad, and snuck into Jezebel's quarters and stole an old ship's log full of incriminating evidence -- while Jezebel was in the room, relaxing in a bathtub full of blood.<br/><br/>Next morning, Cyrus goes over to The V.D. to get the Secret.  He has to put on the Helmet of Knowledge.  He's extraordinarily hesitant, but eventually decides it won't be a fatal idea.  Then he feels something crawl into his ear, and teleports himself out of there faster than a horny sky squid.  It's simply the Worm of Knowledge, though, so, thus reassured, he puts the helmet back on and the Worm of Knowledge crawls into his ear, and eventually dissolves.<br/><br/>Deadlytoque had a very clever theory about how it was the larval form of sky butterflies that have this psychic beacon network for navigation or something... I'll let him get into it.<br/><br/>So anyway, they have the Secret now, so it's time to finally go track Uriah down.  They fly into the Remnants, which are mostly deserted, and finally reach Uriah's hideout -- The Throbbing Member.<br/><br/>Natasha chats up Uriah, who still thinks she's just a silly noble girl out to play pirate.  They part on relatively bloodless terms.  Then Natasha decides she wants to be a freelance pirate hunter, and recruits Cyrus and Snargle into the endeavour.<br/><br/>The game wrapped up, and we're looking eagerly forward to the next installment from John Harper.<br/><br/>Systematically the game worked a bit smoother this time, although it also felt a bit... lower energy, which is possibly just me.  I need a bit more practice filling up the quiver of bangs, I think.  But it was a good time all around.<br/><br/>Big props to the players, who were hard-working and never really sent me the "it's your job to entertain us" vibe.  And of course another big thanks to John Harper.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215562/#Comment_215562" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T16:35:02+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  4:35PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>Deadlytoque had a very clever theory about how it was the larval form of sky butterflies that have this psychic beacon network for navigation or something...

They live mostly in the deep blue, eating whatever bacteria and strange plants survive down there, and serving as food for any number of strange sky-creatures. Think of them as big, pretty plankton. When they are ready to mate, they fly to the Remnants, pick out a nice island, have confusing butterfly sex, and then lay their eggs all over the place. The caterpillars grow, cocoon, turn into butterflies, and then soar off back to the feeding grounds. But when they are grown, they can always find their way back to where they underwent metamorphosis, even if the specific island they were on has shifted position.<br/><br/>Oh, and did I mention that the body of the caterpillar is made out of a substance not at all unlike human brain tissue?<br/><br/>So, to navigate the Remnants you must;:<br/>1) catch two or more adult lepidascerbia;<br/>2) take your new pets to the island you want to be able to find;<br/>3) let them get busy;<br/>4) harvest the eggs;<br/>5) raise the caterpillars;<br/>6) put the caterpillars into your brain, and let them melt into goo;<br/>7) ???<br/>8) profit!<br/><br/>Of course, you still need to be a damned skilled pilot, what with all the rocks and crap everywhere, and you need a new butterfly every single time you want to make sure you can find a new place, but, hey, them's the breaks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215888/#Comment_215888" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T19:09:08+00:00" title="July  1, 2009  7:09PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2009 7:10PM by deadlytoque.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://picasaweb.google.ca/deadlytoque/UntitledAlbum#5353678828879659666" rel="nofollow">Snargle</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215897/#Comment_215897" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T20:22:44+00:00" title="July  1, 2009  8:22PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Love it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215918/#Comment_215918" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-02T00:12:43+00:00" title="July  2, 2009 12:12AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/deadly">@deadly</a>: Sweet merciful jesus!
