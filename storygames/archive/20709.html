The description of the move ("go aggro") is not a terribly clear fictional trigger. What does it actually mean?<br/><br/>The explanatory text says:\n<blockquote><br/>Going aggro means using violence or the threat of violence to control somebody else\u2019s behavior, without (or before) fighting. If the character has the drop on her enemy, or if the enemy won\u2019t fight back, or if the character is making a show of force but isn\u2019t disposed to really fight, it\u2019s going aggro.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>If the target forces the character\u2019s hand and sucks it up, that means that the character inflicts harm upon the target as normal, determined by her weapon and her subject\u2019s armor. At<br/>this point, the player can\u2019t decide not to inflict harm, it\u2019s gone too far for that.<br/></blockquote>\n<br/><br/>It occurs to me that violence OR the <i>threat of violence</i> covers some pretty different territory. We are instructed to use "seduce or manipulate" if the character isn't actually planning to hurt their target, just bluffing. (Not sure why this handled with +hot instead of *hard* in this instance, but that's neither here nor there...)<br/><br/>One possible interpretation of the move is that the acting character is <i>already in motion</i>, carrying out this violent act. (Like firing bullets at someone - covering fire - to force them to keep their head down.) In this instance, it's really clear why the victim has the choice to suck it up or give in.<br/><br/>"Go aggro", here, means quite literally to behave in some way like a violent maniac. This suits Apocalypse World quite well! <br/><br/>And the back-and-forth is satisfying: one player starts the action, the other concludes it.<br/><br/>However, what if it's just the *threat* of violence? I've always had a problem with this. <br/><br/>"I stick my gun in his face and I tell him to hand over the money!"<br/><br/>Go aggro, right? It's "...using [...] the threat of violence to control somebody else\u2019s behavior, without (or before) fighting." <br/><br/>But what if we're playing and the MC says, "Whoa there! I don't have the money!" (And it's true.)<br/><br/>Now what do we do? By the rules, it's "too late" - if I rolled a 10+ and Dremmer can't hand over the cash, I can't decide NOT to shoot him.<br/><br/>This feels awkward in play. I'm tempted to carry out *threats* of violence through regular roleplaying/conversation, and only bring in the "go aggro" move when the PC actually commits to acting with violence, as the move implies. <br/><br/>(In our example, then, there would be no roll. We'd just play it out, with the PC having the option to just "inflict harm" - pull the trigger - if they don't like the NPC's response. After all, they maneuvered themselves into a position where his life is in their hands. Alternatively, we could use the "seduce/manipulate" move.)<br/><br/>Am I making sense, or is there a better solution? How do you handle this?<br/><br/>(Also, if you like my suggested solution, how would you recommend deciding when to just play it out and when to bring in seduce/manipulate? I'm not sure where the line would be drawn there.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454777/#Comment_454777" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-07T23:44:47+00:00" title="July  7, 2016 11:44PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2016 12:00AM by Paul_T.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another example is that "the threat of violence used to control someone's behaviour, without (or before) fighting" can cover territory that is clearly NOT "go aggro". <br/><br/>For instance, I stand outside your hardhold's walls and I shout: "Hey, fucker! You, in there! Open the gates right now or I'm going to cut you in half with a chainsaw!"<br/><br/>Clearly not a good match for the move.<br/><br/>However, here's another thing:<br/><br/>In the Second Edition, Vincent uses the "go aggro" move for attacking someone out of the blue. This makes a lot of sense! <br/><br/>However, a lot of the options a character has on a 7-9 look rather like response to <i>threats</i> of violence, rather than actual violence. "Tell them something they want to hear" is more of a response to someone intimidating you someone attacking you.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear how this plays out in your games.

That move is explicitly for "when weapons are out on both sides" -&gt; there is no way to avoid or forestall fighting. In other words, the fighting has already started, and on both sides. Go aggro is for when that's NOT the case - essentially, one side is not ready or willing to fight.<br/><br/>2. True. I included some fictional detail in my examples, though.

However, it doesn't solve the issue in a very elegant way.<br/><br/>Essentially, in one case the player has *already* fired their weapon. In the other, they are threatening with it, but haven't actually carried through yet. However, in the latter case, the move does not give the player the option to "change their mind", which is a bit awkward if new information comes up during the resolution of the move.<br/><br/>It's weird to take away player agency in a situation where the character very much *should* have the option to choose. So, we have to either accept that limitation, re-envision the move a different way diegetically, or, as you suggest, try to make sure we get ALL the information out in the open BEFORE we roll.<br/><br/>I'm seeing some dissonance in the design of the move - it's trying to cover two quite different actions and the possible results sometimes suggest one and sometimes the other. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454891/#Comment_454891" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T22:19:50+00:00" title="July  8, 2016 10:19PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one small detail is getting lost in technicalities.<br/>At least, as far as I have always played and understood the moves in any PbtA.<br/><br/>Go Aggro happens when you use violence (or the threat of it) <b>to force someone to do something</b>.<br/>If they can't, or if they are already willing, the move does not trigger. It makes no sense!<br/><br/>If Shithead wants the money Dremmer stole, but Dremmer does not have it anymore... many things can happen.<br/>But the moment Shithead describes the use of violence to get the money, the MC has to think "<i>what is happening?</i>".<br/><br/>It is the same as asking "<i>are u bluffing or are you ready to do violence for real</i>?"<br/>Only now the MC asks herself what's going on with the NPC.<br/><br/>If Dremmer does not have the money, no Aggro happens. He is unable to do whatever Shithead asks.<br/>So the MC tells "I have no money!!!" and it is now the player's turn again.<br/>Do you trust his words?<br/>&lt;&lt; No, I shoot his foot and scream "Tell me the truuuuuuuth!!!" &gt;&gt;<br/><br/>Now THIS could again be an Aggro... the player is asking for something that CAN be obtained: the truth, or at least to be convinced that Dremmer is telling what he believes to be the truth.<br/><br/>But again... MC, what's going on?<br/>If Dremmer is already scared shitless and opposes no resistance, just spilling the beans and doing all he can to tell the truth... then the Move does not stand.<br/>It is just fiction and conversation.<br/>I do this, therefore that happens.<br/>Move on.<br/><br/>A different matter is if the MC thinks:<br/>1) I know Dremmer would not tell the truth just like that, let's see if Shithead convinces him<br/>2) I don't know if Dremmer would just talk, let's see what happens<br/><br/>In such cases then YES, you roll Aggro.<br/>Same applies to Seduce/Manipulate ... it's a Move meant to CONVINCE people to do something for the PC.<br/>If they are already doing it, or ready to do it... the move is not rolled.

I'd think it would be a very positive thing to be able to point a gun at someone and ask them to fly to the moon by flapping their arms! Sounds like something lots of psychotic post-apocalypse wackos would try...<br/><br/>The disconnect occurs later, when the player is *forced* to shoot them if they refuse, for no apparent in-fiction reason.<br/><br/>That's the crux of the matter: are we imagining this as the PC attacking their victim ("going aggro" on him), or as the PC threatening someone ("before (or without) violence")? One works well with the 10+ choices; the other seems to fit better with the 7-9 choices.<br/><br/>Not rolling for it when the NPC can't fulfill your demands also seems at odds with AW's "if you do it, do it" ethos.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454914/#Comment_454914" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-09T06:02:31+00:00" title="July  9, 2016  6:02AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So you say:<br/><br/>"I point my gun at the guy and yell 'start flappin' your arms or else!'"<br/><br/>And the GM says:<br/><br/>"He yells 'screw you!'

It isn't. But it does work. Paul, I think you're involuntarily being all "Zeno's paradox" about it and making it not work by overthinking it, really.<br/><br/>It's not that the game "forces" you to pull the trigger, it's that the moment you roll+hard you're <i>committing to</i> pulling the trigger.<br/>The move is about getting what you want by murderous violence\u2026 The moment you roll, it's a statement that successful murder sounds like a favorable outcome to you, even if there's something you'd like even more. Reaching for the dice is saying one of <i>three</i> things:<br/><br/>1. There's this thing I really want, but I'll settle for retaliative murder (the default stakes) if I can't have it.<br/>2. I mostly want them dead, but I wouldn't mind settling for X instead.<br/>3. I want them either dead or dead, and won't compromise on it.<br/><br/>On a 7-9, you fail to murder them - maybe you missed, maybe you flinched, maybe they dodged or ran very fast - but you still get <i>something</i> out of your earnest murderous attempt, like having them out of your way, maybe even permanently.<br/><br/>On a 10+, and that's the catch, it's not you but the MC (or other PC) who has a choice between handing you their head on a platter (successful murder) or that other thing you might have wanted (if any). That is, you win and the other side has a choice between meeting your arbitrary, un-negotiated demand, or conceding the default stakes of murderous violence (injury and probable death). I trust an MC to choose according to agenda and principles; as for another PC-player, it's only fair it's their choice.<br/><br/>Now, for the special cases discussed in this thread (have any of these actually happened in your game/s, or are we practicing the fine art of debating hypothetical scenarios?):<br/><br/>* If you tell a guy to flap his arms all the way to the moon, and you mean it, then I assume it's <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> - you want them dead or dead, right?<br/><br/>* If you demand money from a broke guy (what do you mean by "money" in Apocalypse World, btw?), that's the same as the above arm-flapping scenario and you should <i>know</i> - because that's what honesty demands and we aren't playing gotcha with hidden information in AW.<br/><br/>* If you think you're going aggro on them and you roll 10+ and earn your successful murder and <i>now</i> you realize you don't <i>want</i> them dead: cool. It's just a do-over. Turns out the fictional trigger wasn't there after all. Nothing happened.<br/>It's clear from other parts of the book that AW assumes these things do happen sometimes, and it's no big deal, and it doesn't need to be specifically regulated or anything: it's just players making a mistake with the rules and then realizing they did and fixing it. This goes for most games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454919/#Comment_454919" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-09T07:51:23+00:00" title="July  9, 2016  7:51AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2016 7:51AM by Rafu.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            deleted for double post                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454930/#Comment_454930" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-09T17:36:23+00:00" title="July  9, 2016  5:36PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, gents.

Maybe trying to handle them both the same is the issue here?<br/><br/>That's what I'm speculating about.<br/><br/>I'm cool with going, "Ok, hang on.

If the player's bluffing, they should decline to roll the move.<br/><br/>If you go aggro on someone and demand that they do something impossible, and hit the roll with a 10+, the only choice they have is to force your hand and suck it up. You're making an excuse to shoot them. You should still roll the move, though, because you might miss or you might hit with a 7-9.<br/><br/>If you go aggro on someone when you aren't in a position to hurt them - like you have a chainsaw and they're on the other side of a stronghold wall - then I don't know what you're thinking, but if you're serious you can still roll the move, because you might miss. If you hit, though, they can just choose to force your hand and suck it up. Since you can't inflict harm from where you are, they can choose it perfectly safely.

Do you include fictional detail to explain why the situation is such that it's the other party who is choosing to suck it up (or not), or just understand that this is how the rule works and narrate accordingly *after the fact* (as Hasimir suggests, above)?<br/><br/>I'm basically looking for a "Best Practice" on how to make this smooth in play, after all.<br/><br/>It's kind of a weird cousin of "always misdirect" and "never name your move" - do we lay bare the bones of the rules and say, "Hey, so since we decide this was a 'go aggro', now let's make up something which makes this outcome make sense", or do we shape the fiction in that direction before we even roll?

I don't get it.</blockquote>\nI get it. A player can commit to going aggro, knowing that their character will flip out and just murder the guy if he doesn't give the player what they want, but does the <i>character</i> know that? I think the answer is yes \u2013 otherwise it's just not the right move.<br/><br/>But this text from ApocalypseWorld-1up.pdf implies something strange about the advanced "go aggro" move:\n<blockquote><i>On a 12+, they have to cave and do what you want. You\u2019ve overwhelmed them; they can\u2019t possibly bring themselves to force your hand.</i></blockquote>\nExcept they have to force your hand, if they can't deliver! The confusing part about all this, for me, is that the move seems to demand a sort of metafictional knowledge to use, and you get metafictional knowledge out of it if the target can't deliver.<br/><br/>Anyway, I don't think I've seen a viable use case for this move posted in this thread, so I'll try to construct one:<br/><br/>You've captured three people, and you're pretty sure at least one has information that you want. You've tied them to chairs that are up against a wall. You choose one of them and put your gun to their head. You tell that person to give up the info, or else you're going to shoot them as an example to the others. You roll a 10+, and they don't have the info, so they suck it up and force your hand. You shoot them, like the big jerk you are.<br/><br/>Incidentally, such a target wouldn't be able to take most of the normally available actions on a 7-9, so they'd have to either "tell you what you want to know (or what you <i>want to hear</i>)" or force your hand.<br/><br/>In a case where you genuinely intend violence but you care about keeping your target alive, it doesn't make sense for your character to go aggro with lethal intent. Threaten something frightening but non-lethal instead. Maybe shooting out a kneecap, like the big jerk you are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454991/#Comment_454991" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-10T16:43:09+00:00" title="July 10, 2016  4:43PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 10, 2016 6:30PM by jangler.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or one of your friends is injured in a fight, and some member of the opposition has surrendered.

However, your further examples, I think, aren't actually problems. "Going aggro" isn't a magic bullet, is it? It's just your guy doing some nasty and violent to get other people to change their beat.<br/><br/>My interpretation is that the <i>thing you want</i> is handled *fictionally*, not at the level of the rules between the players. If I'm pointing a gun at you, then I have to gesture or speak or otherwise communicate my desires to you. Sometimes I might be able to simply limit your options enough to get you to do what I want (e.g. covering fire). I<br/><br/>I think it's pretty clear that when you're asking someone do something, therefore, you're not putting some kind of rules-backed pressure on the fictional reality to conform to your wishes. No, it's better to see it as putting pressure on the *character* you're dealing with.<br/><br/>And, in that context, it's pretty clear that the most you can ask is for the victim to <i>do as much as they can</i>. <br/><br/>In other words, ask someone to fly to the moon, and the most you'll get is them flapping their arms. In my view, they have fulfilled your request by doing so - whether they are *capable* of it or not is not an issue.<br/><br/>Vincent,<br/><br/>Ok! "Sometimes" means a 'no'. In other words, this isn't a concern for you. That's cool.<br/><br/>I personally find this flow of events awkward, though, and I suspect I'm not the only one:<br/><br/>A goes aggro, rolls 10+: "I run over to him and stick my shotgun in his face. 'Pick up that barrel and give it to me!'"<br/>B responds, revealing new information A didn't have: "I'm shaking and I can barely talk. 'W-w-wait! The barrel is rigged with mine... I move it and it blows!'"<br/><br/>or:<br/><br/>B responds, revealing new information A didn't have: "He reaches over to grab the barrel... and you can see there's something on the back of the thing. A limpet mine?"<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>There's a point, there, where the *character* should, by rights, have a <i>decision point</i> (whether to carry through with the threat or not). The way we're imagining the fiction, it seems very natural. <br/><br/>However, the *rules* tell us that they don't get that choice. That feels a bit funny at the table, you know? It seems like we either have to ignore the fiction or ignore the rule.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, the MC is not supposed to make a move there. However, there is a "beat" here where the victim responds, and the whole reason the aggressive character is holding their fire is to give them a chance to do so. Whether it's a PC or NPC, we need to know how the character responds, so someone has to narrate *something*.<br/><br/>Now, the guy going aggro deliberately didn't shoot *first*, because he wants to give the victim a chance to respond. That's the whole point of holding his fire: he wants to see what's going to happen, and then he can decide whether to shoot or not.<br/><br/>It's weird that the rules then take away that opportunity from the player. Again, I understand why they do from a *rules* perspective, but it seems to jar with the way we're imagining the fiction a little.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454998/#Comment_454998" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-10T21:24:47+00:00" title="July 10, 2016  9:24PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You understood the crux of my concern, yes.

I could only see it coming up due to GM prep or the player being forgetful, or something like that. But the principle remains: if some new information is introduced, it would make sense for the threatening *character* to have an opportunity to reconsider their action.

I want to question him before I shoot."<br/><br/>Part of the problem might be that I want to be able to play this game "fiction-first" - yes, if you follow the rules strictly, they "work", but when the outcomes are a mismatch with what we're imagining, it can be frustrating. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455069/#Comment_455069" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-13T00:12:27+00:00" title="July 13, 2016 12:12AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I insist that's really an awkward moment to introduce new information, and that's a big part of the problem you're experiencing (or expecting to experience).<br/><br/>The point is not whether the trap - or Buddha, or whatever - comes from the MC's prep (like, written down in Front somewhere) or not.

This is kind of Rafu's point, but from a slightly different angle. If there's still information the MC is holding back, then don't let the player roll yet. <br/><br/>In the barrel example, you say:\n<blockquote>A goes aggro, rolls 10+: "I run over to him and stick my shotgun in his face. 'Pick up that barrel and give it to me!'"</blockquote>\nThis already seems out of order to me, before we even get to the MC's reaction. A should say what he does <i>first</i>, before rolling Go Aggro. This gives the MC time to react in between the action and the roll--the MC can just say "go ahead and Go Aggro," or "he says he can't because the barrel is rigged to blow, what do you do?" Then, only when all the information has been gathered and both player and character are really ready to commit to pulling the trigger, does Go Aggro get rolled. <br/><br/>Holding another character at gunpoint while you gather information isn't a move--or rather, it might still be Go Aggro, but then the "do what you want" result would be standing still and giving you info. "Give me that barrel" would require a second roll when you're done withholding violence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457661/#Comment_457661" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-30T00:56:20+00:00" title="October 30, 2016 12:56AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2016 1:05AM by Paul_T.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking about this further, and I'm still a bit confused. Little workarounds like asking clarifying questions or supplying information and then rewinding, or handing the decision point back to the player (as Vincent suggests) are very good.<br/><br/>This is excellent, because it gives us tools to make this better and smoother in play.<br/><br/>However, I still feel that there's a little weirdness here. I'm looking at this as a design question, not a "play advice" question. Why do so many questions about this come up?<br/><br/>Keep in mind that I'm coming at this from the perspective of a gamer who wants vivid and continuous fiction at the table. I know lots of people play with more remove - "we're activating this move, and we follow its steps" - and that's fine. So, this whole conundrum may likely not apply to your game, if your style is different.<br/><br/>I have a hypothesis I'm testing out here. Let me try to put it another way:<br/><br/>On a 10+, the victim can do what you want, or they can force your hand. This implies, to me, that the aggressor (for lack of a better term) has already committed to a violent course of action. A perfect example is giving someone a beating until they talk, or spraying bullets to force someone to stay down.<br/><br/>On a 7-9, instead, the victim has all kinds of options. However, many of these options look like responses to a <i>threat</i> of violence, not <i>actual</i> violence. <br/><br/>e.g.<br/><br/>* Give you something they think you want, or tell you what you want to hear.<br/>* Back off calmly, hands where you can see.<br/><br/>These are responses to a gun pointed at you, or someone threatening you by drawing a knife. They don't (necessarily, or always) make sense when you're under attack.<br/><br/>But the 10+ results don't fit that kind of situation very well. <br/><br/>So, the move is trying to cover a lot of territory, in a way. <br/><br/>On a 10+, the rules imply, to me, that my character has somehow maneuvered themselves into a position where they can bring down violence on their victim's head, whenever they wish.<br/><br/>On a 7-9, on the other hand, my character clearly has not succeeded in that.<br/><br/>Now, there are two possibilities here:<br/><br/>1. We've got a move that covers a lot of ground. This is out of necessity (rules need to be simplifications, or our games will get far too baroque, so breaking it into various other moves would be unnecessarily complex). So be aware of that, and apply this carefully, keeping in mind the various re-frames, rewinding, and other tactics mentioned so far.<br/><br/>The rule is clear about how decision-making power is passing from one player to the other; craft your fiction to make sense from that standpoint, however you need to.<br/><br/>2. I've answered my own question, above. The roll doesn't just happen when the character commits to a course of action, like drawing a knife and threatening their enemy. No, the outcome actually describes for us <i>what happens next</i>.<br/><br/>I'm not yet 100% convinced this works in all cases, but I like it in principle. In other words, a 7-9 and a 10+ take place at different stages in the IIEE process (is there a better term for this nowadays?). (This wouldn't be unusual; lots of Vincent's designs do this, starting with <i>Dogs</i>. I'm going to have to dissect other moves now, to see if this is common throughout AW!)<br/><br/>We need another little bit of narration after the roll, in other words, to establish some fictional details, kind of like a See in <i>Dogs</i>.<br/><br/>It looks something like this:<br/><br/>A player announces an action which threatens another, and sets them on a path to violence.<br/><br/>Example Case 1: "I stand up from my chair and draw my knife. This fucker isn't leaving until he spills the beans."<br/><br/>Example Case 2: "I draw a bead on him with my rifle. I hope he doesn't move. As soon as he's in my sights, he's dead meat."<br/><br/>On a miss, the MC can actually interrupt that action - like in some of the examples in the AW book, things might get screwed up as far back as all the way at Initiation, if the MC likes.<br/><br/>1. "As you're reaching for your knife, he kicks dirt in your face. By the time you clear your eyes, he's already gone." <br/><br/>2. "You're drawing a bead on the guy when rocks tumble all around you from above - you're being ambushed! A heavy figure crashes into you..."<br/><br/>On a 7-9, you've successfully Initiated the action, but the ball is, nevertheless, still in the victim's court. You've been quick/decisive/competent enough to get the upper hand, but the victim can still try to escape the situation, if that's possible for them to do.<br/><br/>1. "You draw your knife and stand up. He goes to reach for his own knife... but he quickly realizes you're too fast for him to pull anything. He puts his hands up and begs you to reconsider as he slowly steps back... what do you do?"<br/><br/>2. "You draw a bead and fire a shot, but it goes wide. Your victim, spooked, scrambles madly for cover, diving through the gate into the shelter. You don't think he saw you."<br/><br/>Now, on a 10+, you've not only Initiated successfully, you've also Executed, or something like it - enough so that your victim no longer has any choice to make but what you're hoping: you've cut off every avenue of retreat, and they must do as you want or they suffer the consequences. In a way, the Effect, now, is up to them.<br/><br/>1. "He's frozen with fear as you step forward and place your knife under his chin. He [spills the beans/refuses and you gut him]."<br/><br/>2. "He holds still long enough for you to get him in your sights and pull the trigger. One clean shot and his head explodes like a watermelon." <br/><br/><i>This</i> is an interpretation of the move I could get behind, I think - or at least a different way to approach it. It seems to demand some narration of the player's actions on the part of the MC (or some questioning, to accomplish the same), but that's quite doable.<br/><br/>(It's still interesting to me that in Case 1, on a 10+, the aggressor has not, in the fiction, made an attack yet, but nevertheless has no choice not to follow through. This makes a strong statement about the nature of Apocalypse World and the interaction between the players is clear and good, but I don't know how to explain it fictionally. It seems to work a little cleaner in Case 2, where it is clear - in the fiction - that the aggressor is going to pull the trigger from the moment the move comes into play. Is there a way to play the knife-threatening example that way, too? Should the aggressor be narrating their actions further through, like, "I draw my knife, stand up, walk over to him, and put it through his skull. Does he say anything? If he tells me the location of the hideout, I'll stop.")<br/><br/>Interesting to consider, in any case. Hmmmm. Is this helpful to anyone, extra confusing, totally wrong, or something else?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/miedvied" title="miedvied"><img alt="miedvied" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/miedvied">miedvied</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457822/#Comment_457822" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-03T15:09:33+00:00" title="November  3, 2016  3:09PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2016 2:30AM by miedvied.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>On a miss, the MC can actually interrupt that action - like in some of the examples in the AW book, things might get screwed up as far back as all the way at Initiation, if the MC likes.<br/></blockquote>\nI hesitate on timelines here. I think it's worth making sure the MC doesn't go back in time too far - the game is still based on "to do it, do it," which means the player's move (and the MC's consequential move) doesn't happen if the character doesn't undertake the triggering fiction. It's like going back in time to kill your grandparents. The 6- shouldn't go so far as to un-trigger the move itself. If the player chose to Go Aggro, it might go awry, but being honest to the fiction means respecting that this character *went aggro*.<br/><br/>I don't mean to be pedantic; I had a conversation with an MC just the other day who had a habit of using 6-'s to invalidate players actions entirely, going so far as to insist a 6- on Go Aggro means, by default, you weren't even able to threaten the NPC, not that your threat failed / spun out of control / worked just fine but something else went awry. He retroactively un-chose a player's choice, which f's Apocalypse Engine's gameplay loop.<br/><br/>I promise to come back and read the rest of your post more carefully this weekend.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457830/#Comment_457830" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-03T18:57:38+00:00" title="November  3, 2016  6:57PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2016 6:58PM by Paul_T.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with that! <br/><br/>It's always more interesting to have events put into motion by character actions - and, I would argue, that's a large driver behind AW's mechanics: the basic "yes, but" construction of most common outcomes serves to always drive play forward in a way which "nah, this happens instead" often doesn't.<br/><br/>There are fun versions of this kind of MC move, however, and there are several examples of the MC doing that in the AW text itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/miedvied" title="miedvied"><img alt="miedvied" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/miedvied">miedvied</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457846/#Comment_457846" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-04T02:31:37+00:00" title="November  4, 2016  2:31AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been reading 2e today. If you think 1e's Go Aggro description resulted in endless confusion... I literally had to reopen 1e to confirm to myself I wasn't just hallucinating that Go Aggro used to be the "threatening people with an earnest promise of violence to control their behavior" move, since it now reads as a combat move. <br/><br/>It's still technically the same rule if you parse the text very carefully, but shit... you have to know what you're looking for. Because of that, I think there's actually more confusion now: the question used to be the relationship between violence and behavior modification in the go aggro move. Now it's more than that:<br/><br/>"Going aggro on someone means threatening or attacking them when<br/>it\u2019s not, or not yet, a fight. Use it whenever the character\u2019s definitely the<br/>aggressor: when the target isn\u2019t expecting the attack, isn\u2019t prepared to<br/>fight back, doesn\u2019t want to fight back, or can\u2019t fight back effectively."<br/><br/>If not for the 10+ options, you wouldn't even think this had anything to do with behavior control at all.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/miedvied" title="miedvied"><img alt="miedvied" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/miedvied">miedvied</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457959/#Comment_457959" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-07T21:31:27+00:00" title="November  7, 2016  9:31PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, where Go Aggro gets me, is that it feels like the core text of the move is the same as it was in 1e, but where in 1e it was the "earnestly threaten with violence move," now it looks like a combat move, with violence being moved into Manipulate/Seduce.  To wit;<br/><br/>"Going aggro on someone means..."<br/><br/>1) a) Threatening them when it's not, or not yet, a fight<br/>1) b) Attacking them when it's not, or not yet, a fight<br/><br/>It's "not a fight" means:<br/>a) "The target isn't expecting the attack"<br/>b) "The target isn't prepared to fight back"<br/>c) "The target doesn't want to fight back"<br/>d) "The target can't fight back effectively"<br/><br/>1e actually noted this was about threatening someone, right? Which made the 10+ choices of "force your hand and suck it up" or "cave and do what you want" actually make a lot more sense. Here, it feels like the 10+ choices are the only indication that this move is actually triggered by *an attempt to threaten / harm someone into changing their behavior." It's actually not clear from the above description at all that it's about behavior control. <br/><br/>This interacts with "Sucker Someone" - if someone is unsuspecting or helpless, and you could potentially miss, the target has to cave as per a 10+ on going aggro. If you can't miss, it's an automatic "deal harm." This makes sense with the example of "going aggro" in an attempt to snipe someone, but makes no sense with an example of "earnestly threatening someone with violence to change their course of action." Right? The snipe can't possibly change a course of action, it has nothing to do with a behavioral modification, it's just an attack. (I will understand if someone wants to chime in with "You *are* changing their course of action - their previous course was 'living'," but I honestly find such metaphorical stretches of wording to be less illuminating rather than more. It's reasonable not to read the rules of the game as wide-open metaphors.)<br/><br/>This is made further unclear by the definition of "Seduce or Manipulate," which now includes "To ... manipulate an NPC, the character needs leverage: sex, or a threat.... something that the character can really do that the victim really wants or really doesn't want." This actually seems like it captures the ground of Go Aggro from 1e - I've got violence, and I want you to do a thing.<br/><br/>Honestly, I was never confused - or thought I wasn't - about Go Aggro from 1e. But 2e has lost me, unless it was intended to carve out threats into Manipulate... but if it was, the core Go Aggro move still looks a lot like the old "threaten with violence" move.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457961/#Comment_457961" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-07T23:42:37+00:00" title="November  7, 2016 11:42PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oddly enough, I have less of a problem with this.

You have moves, and you make them when you want to.<br/><br/>Taking this point of view clarifies a lot of these issues.<br/><br/>As Rafu says, above: that's the design of the rule, and when you use it, that's what you're signing off on. The move says something about the nature of Apocalypse World - it's only when you're already committed to hurting or killing someone that you get to roll dice.<br/><br/>The move isn't triggered by the character's actions; it's also up to the player to decide whether the circumstances and consequences are appropriate and worthwhile.<br/><br/>If taken in this spirit, the move seems to work just fine, I think. (As long as we're willing to be smart about choosing options, and use some of the tricks mentioned above.) To "go aggro", I need to have a character threatening another character with physical violence, *and* I, as a player, need to be ready to commit to the consequences of the move. Both conditions must be met, in other words. The fictional situation must be right, but the player must also be choosing to make the move.<br/><br/>This really makes sense when I consider some of Vincent's other comments (e.g. "Of course they still roll if the victim is helpless; otherwise you're taking away the player's chance to, for instance, earn XP from a highlighted stat" - not a verbatim quote, note). That makes 100% sense from this perspective.<br/><br/>However, some people (and I seem to be one of them) have been quite inspired by the idea of AW as a game where fictional events and situations trigger move-use and die rolls. Indeed, this is implied in the AW text, as well ("if you do it, do it: and make with the dice").<br/><br/>From that point of view, a character pulling out a gun and threatening their victim *is* the trigger for the move, and we must "make with the dice". <br/><br/>If you approach the game from that latter perspective, as I apparently have, that's when you run into this trouble. Under the former paradigm, however, this issue doesn't even come up.<br/><br/>OK! Interesting. For me, at least, that explains the apparent confusion in this discussion.<br/><br/>Would do you think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

"To do it, do it" is like... the number one rule in the game, from which all moves follow. It's the game text, and central to the game text. And, honestly, while I definitely value Vx taking the time to help us understand intentions and rationale behind stuff in the game, I ... have no intention of over-ruling a really explicit and well-supported part of the game on the basis of fora comments. <br/><br/>That said, at least from the comment you included in this thread, I'm not sure he is overruling the "fictional triggers" thing (if he did it elsewhere, please link). The only time I would abbreviate it is if, as Vx seems to have made an example of, there was no element of uncertainty - rolls are for when outcomes are uncertain ("rolls are to surprise us," to paraphrase from the book). But that should rarely be the case (you're not *really* Going Aggro if there's 0% uncertainty about whether they will do what you want or not - which, I guess, is why he included the non-rolling Sucker Someone in 2e). You're not "do something under fire" if there's no actual "fire" that makes your success uncertain; you're not "reading a charged situation" if the situation isn't charged and it's uncertain how it's about to blow off, etc. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458096/#Comment_458096" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-15T07:33:55+00:00" title="November 15, 2016  7:33AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2016 7:35AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the clarification is that you can start with the intention to make a move, and then take action in the fiction in accordance with that intention.

You set up a binary and because one side turned out to be incorrect (that AW is a 'fiction triggers moves' game, exclusively), you went all-in on the opposite even though there is in fact a middle ground, which in this case turns out to be how I believe the game to work.<br/><br/>Moves are triggered by character's actions, it's just not the only way to trigger them. A move can also be triggered by a player declaring their intention to make a move.<br/><br/>This is not the same thing as saying that the player's intention is a necessary component of triggering the move. The move must be triggered by the demands of the fiction, in the same way the fiction must provide justification for the move, if it is simply declared by player intention. <br/><br/>If the player-as-character says 'I'm gonna shoot this guy if he doesn't get out of the car', she does not need to add 'also I am totally Going Aggro.' If the MC points out that 'I'm gonna shoot this guy if he doesn't get out of the car' is Going Aggro, and the player doesn't want to Go Aggro, they have to change the fiction; e.g. to 'I'm gonna point my gun at this guy and tell him to get the fuck out of the car.'<br/><br/>Similarly, if the player says 'I'm gonna Go Aggro on this guy to get him out of the car', they need to provide a fictional description that matches the move. When the MC asks 'okay, so what does that look like?' they can't say 'I'm going to pretend I'm going to shoot him if he doesn't get out of the car.' If the MC points this out and they still want to Go Aggro, they have to change the fiction to match.<br/><br/>In either case you have to end up with the same thing: fiction that matches the move, a move that matches the fiction. It's just not necessary that the fiction part happens first.<br/><br/>In both cases, player assent is required, but there is no version where the player can substantively alter the Move without also altering the fiction. There is no version of 'I am going to shoot this guy if he doesn't get out of the car' that is not Go Aggro. <br/><br/>So yes, the thing you are saying in the quoted bit is true in some important sense, but it's true of the entire package together -- because the MC is supposed to be honest and transparent with the players about consequences, which includes letting them back out of actions (prior to resolution) if they didn't understand their consequences. But it's not some sort of antithesis of a fiction-first or fiction-matters approach, either.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458117/#Comment_458117" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-16T03:44:55+00:00" title="November 16, 2016  3:44AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like, I feel like part of the reason player intention seems so important in Go Aggro is because the fictional trigger/accompaniment of Go Aggro requires knowledge of the <i>character's</i> intentions. But that doesn't require an overhaul of how the game works, it just requires additional clarity concerning the fiction. That's why example fiction that includes intention makes it seem obvious, and examples that are ambiguous make it seem confusing.<br/><br/>i.e. contrast 'I'm gonna shoot this guy if he doesn't get out of the car' with 'I am going to threaten this guy with my gun so he gets out of the car'.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458126/#Comment_458126" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-16T14:55:52+00:00" title="November 16, 2016  2:55PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right.

What has to happen in the fiction for us all to go, "Yeah, ok, he's going aggro"?<br/><br/>For most other moves, it's pretty clear, or established by precedent (e.g. "open your brain").<br/><br/>So, what about "go aggro"? <br/><br/>My hypothesis is that this is why people are getting tripped up on this move sometimes:\n<blockquote><br/>i.e. contrast 'I'm gonna shoot this guy if he doesn't get out of the car' with 'I am going to threaten this guy with my gun so he gets out of the car'.<br/></blockquote>\nThe former is *not* a "fictional trigger". It's a statement of character intentions, but we have *no* idea what's actually happening on-screen. Is she talking? Shouting? Just being menacing? Is the gun drawn and pointed, or holstered?<br/><br/>The latter *is* a fictional trigger, or close enough (we can ask for more detail, as it's still pretty vague, but it's something the character is <i>doing</i> - if I was making a movie and that's what the script said, I'd have some idea of what to tell my actors to do on-screen).<br/><br/>However, it's the <i>former</i> in this case which is a better match for the move - as you point out, the latter is not necessarily enough.<br/><br/>Does that help explain?<br/><br/><i>Again, I should restate that I don't have trouble using the move in play - I play AW and it works fine (so long as everyone remembers the various caveats mentioned in this thread). <br/><br/>However, from a DESIGN perspective, I think this is fascinating. And, also, a lot of people do seem to struggle with the move, so I'm hypothesizing here that this might be the reason. I'm open to arguments to the contrary, of course - this is a discussion, not a thesis.<br/></i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458147/#Comment_458147" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-16T22:13:16+00:00" title="November 16, 2016 10:13PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2016 10:16PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><br/>i.e. contrast 'I'm gonna shoot this guy if he doesn't get out of the car' with 'I am going to threaten this guy with my gun so he gets out of the car'.<br/></blockquote>\nThe former is *not* a "fictional trigger".

I totally disagree with your assessment, though.<br/><br/>"I'm gonna shoot this guy if he doesn't get out of the car" is 100% a fictional statement. The player is not going to do any of this. The player is describing their character's intentions. Character intentions exist only in the fiction. They are fictional content.<br/><br/>It's not super surprising that some people don't believe this to be true -- the assumption that intention is less real than action also exists in most people's everyday assessment of reality, and has huge, huge bleed-over with how most people understand 'fiction' and literature in general.<br/><br/>But it's not the case. And while there are arguably lots of very reasonable reasons to distinguish between intent and action in everyday life, none of them apply in the context of determining what is and is not 'fiction' in a roleplaying game.<br/><br/>So, yeah. 'I am gonna shoot this guy if he doesn't get out of the car' is absolutely, unequivocally, a statement of something in the fiction of the game. As such, there is no obvious reason that it should not be sufficient to trigger a move, <i>in general</i>.<br/><br/>Now I think you're also right that in most cases, the MC or another player will probably want to ask what the character is physically doing to accomplish this intent. Your mistake, in my opinion -- and possibly the fundamental mistake of people who are legitimately confused about the fictional trigger for Go Aggro, specifically -- is in excluding the necessity of character intent from the fictional trigger in the first place. <br/><br/>(Or getting it mixed up with player intent, for understandable reasons; my feeling is that this is what was happening in the part of your post I quoted, but I could be wrong.)<br/><br/>Of my two examples, though, only one contains the essential trigger of Go Aggro. It may be missing some fictional details that are useful _for other reasons_, but IMO none of those details are necessary for the move to be triggered.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458148/#Comment_458148" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-16T22:18:51+00:00" title="November 16, 2016 10:18PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>And yeah, wow, tangent but -- I could go on for pages on the belief of some players that statements about character intent are not real, or not sufficient, contributions to the fiction.

Particularly if you have some actual play examples (gamer stories!) to share. It sounds quite interesting. Start a new thread? I'll definitely read along.<br/><br/>I feel like you misunderstood my point, however. Sure, those *could* be character intentions. Or they might not. But since when are character intentions part of the mechanics here? Apocalypse World was designed, in part, specifically to avoid I**E mechanics, which skip from intent to consequences, and can (for some people, anyway) feel empty at the table.<br/><br/>My point is that it's a bizarre and vague middle ground. It might be the character's intention... or it might not. (Hopefully it's the player's intention! Some of the 'trouble cases' mentioned in this thread are situations where it's not.) It still tells us nothing about what's happening in the fiction; I, for one, would consider it a pretty slippery slope to start considering "character intent" to be a "fictional trigger". The proper response in the AW context to such a statement is, "Ok, that's nice that you want this outcome. How are you going to do that?" <br/><br/>Thinking about this would also omit situations where it's the player's intention but not the character's; those are really fun, in my opinion, and I see them come a fair bit. (e.g. "Before I even realize what I'm doing, the rage is on me and I'm pounding the guy's face, yelling, 'What did you do to her, you piece of shit?!?'", or, "In that moment, my concentration slips and... I think my guy opens his brain, right there, because of the drugs he's ingested; he's totally losing control")<br/><br/>But maybe I'm missing *your* point. What's the practical application of this idea? How do we use it to solve awkwardness at the table?

Most are <i>way</i> too abstract for it to be possible to identify their fictional trigger absent any statement of character intent. The (now obsolete) basic move Seize by force was triggered <i>when you tried to seize something by force</i>, not <i>when you started a fight</i>. Or: it's called Act under fire, not "Be under fire" - an intent to act is required to trigger the move, and "you can't do it" is often an appropriate (if plain) possible outcome. Read a person isn't called "Engage in conversation", Read a sitch isn't "Look around", etc. And, in any game I've been in, the only fictional trigger for Opening your brain has been at the intent level, strictly, only - it's going to be so unless you establish in the fiction that people take specific concrete action to commune with the maelstrom, like popping mint candy or chanting their name backwards or watching ancient VHS porn. Aw, right: there was once this savvyhead character who had a working computer as the augury antenna in his workspace, and so it was established that for that one character "I switch on my C64" was synonymous with "I open my brain to the psychic maelstrom" - but unless you do that, intent alone is your trigger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458153/#Comment_458153" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-17T01:26:40+00:00" title="November 17, 2016  1:26AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2016 1:27AM by Paul_T.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right.

There's no confusion at all when I say 'I am gonna shoot that guy if he doesn't get out of the car', there is absolutely zero question about the character's intention because I literally just stated the character's intention, thus entering it into the fiction of the game. <br/><br/>Like... if I say 'damn, I feel really sad about what I just did to Rolfball' as part of the regular conversation of AW, that's a real piece of fiction that is really relevant, even though it is literally invisible to all the other characters, and has no immediate consequences on what actions my character might take.

Those examples are just kind of like, not about the same thing I am talking about. A character does not have to have control of themselves for their intentions to be described by a player, or for their intentions to be real. The statement about a character losing control and becoming incredibly violent is a statement about their intentions: that they are violent, possibly uncontrollably violent. That is not a counter-example at all to anything I am saying.\n<blockquote>(For that matter, I even wrote, above, that the declaration of intent is the *best* match for triggering the 'go aggro' move.)</blockquote>\nYou said that _player_ intent was the best match for triggering the go aggro move. I am talking about _character_ intent. They are not the same thing.<br/><br/>Player intent is not specifically relevant to Go Aggro, though it is broadly relevant to all moves, simply because the MC is not supposed to blindside the player with consequences from moves they might not have intended to trigger.<br/><br/>Character intent, however, is specifically relevant to Go Aggro, moreso than many of the other moves (though most of them include an important element of character intent.) As has been rehashed exhaustively, character intent is what separates Go Aggro from Manipulation using the threat of violence.<br/><br/>Confusion occurs when character intent is not regularly a part of how players describe the fiction in AW, because it makes it hard to tell what move has been triggered. This confusion often results in player-to-player conversations about the character's intention, which can then in turn often be mistaken for conversations about the player's intention; i.e. whether they wanted to use that move or not. This results in, for example, the belief  that you need to have player intention to trigger Go Aggro at all. But this is not true. The essence of Go Aggro's fictional trigger is the character's intention vis-a-vis violence. The more regularly players express their character's internal state and feelings, the less confusion there will be at the table as to whether Go Aggro has been triggered.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458155/#Comment_458155" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-17T05:27:46+00:00" title="November 17, 2016  5:27AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like, is the confusion here because earlier I was talking about player intent to trigger a move, and now I have switched to focusing on fictional descriptions of character intent necessarily triggering a move?

I suspect - I think - it doesn't quite matter in play. I realize this discussion is about "not play, but design," but I think the fact that it doesn't really impact play is relevant to the design. So, looking back to how we approach it in play:<br/><br/>1) Player decides he wants to Go Aggro. He says "I want to go aggro." "Oh, but what do you do?" "Oh, ". Player intent --&gt; appropriate fiction --&gt; move. The key here is that we reach a meeting point of player mechanical desire and character action, "to do it, do it," concurrently.<br/><br/>2) Player decides that Character decides he wants to undertake a certain fiction. "So, you're going aggro?" Player desire and character action harmony are assessed here: maybe the player didn't fully understand the impact of the fiction, or its context. He has a chance to adjust fiction to meet player desire (or he might change his mind, and go the other way.) Either way, character and player both "do it," concurrently. Player desire --&gt; fiction --&gt; move.<br/><br/>"Player triggers" or "fiction triggers" is besides the point - both lead to the <i>common reconciliation point</i> of "Are you satisfied that the current fictional situation meets your desires as a player, with the explicitly stated consequences/moves to follow?" As someone just said, quite right, "to do it, do it" has two "its", and two "do's." In saying they were interchangeable, though, I think they were a bit off the mark: the key is that they're <b>concurrent</b>. Neither comes first, neither comes second; both must be satisfied at once.<br/><br/><br/>It should look something like:<br/><br/>Player Triggers Move ---&gt;      Reconciliation of Player Desires, Fiction / Consequences<br/>Fiction Triggers Move---&gt;      Reconciliation of ...<br/><br/>Reconciliation --&gt; Does Fiction Match Player Expectations/Desires? If (N), Proceed to (1). If (Y), Proceed to (2).<br/><br/>(1) Adjust fiction or player desires to suit desired fictional consequences. Loopback to Reconciliation (communicating adjustment w/ MC).<br/><br/>(2) Establish fiction, subject to agreed-upon reconciliation w/ player desires. Proceed to (3).<br/><br/>(3) Move happens, as appropriate.<br/><br/>Character intent is kind of irrelevant: it might create the fictional requirements, or not, depending on the move. In Go Aggro, the requirement is that the character be committed to violence to change a behavior: it doesn't require that commitment be carefully cerebrated over at length. An unrestrained impulse fits the bill, too. All it asks is that the character resort to aggression.<br/><br/>The only question here, specific to Go Aggro, is what specific fiction piece has to be made harmonious with player desire in order for us to proceed with the move. And, the key to go aggro is that, as others have stated, it doesn't depend on a character action, so much as a particular fictional fact: that this character has committed to violence. We can argue all day about whether the "action" is "<b>swings</b> his fist" or "<b>commits</b> to using his fist," the key is that there are no more checkpoints for changing his mind: player and character have reconciled that there are no more turn-offs or jug-handles: this character is going to hit somebody.<br/><br/>It actually doesn't matter whether we describe these things as verbs or intentions, as the moves require them to commit to <b>acting</b> on those intentions - they belong to the same category of fictional elements, separated only by the brief passage of fictional time and the question of whether they are successful in their goal. It's like if we went backwards in time 1/20 of a second before someone took a swing, and grabbed a quick EEG. The initiation of violence is there, in the brain-pan, already existing in the fictional universe. Just because we don't see the fist moving yet, doesn't mean "he's gone aggro" isn't a fictional fact. If we go back another 1/20 of a second, to before the motor cortex has engaged, and jump over to the cerebral cortex (or let's be honest, this is AW - the fucking limbic system is driving everything) where the character has committed to using violence? That's all part of the same move. <br/><br/>I don't think character "intent" and "commitment" are the same thing. Character intent is a sub-category of commitment: "My character is going to shoot that guy if he gets out of the car, 100%, no doubt," can be a reflection of the character's motives and decisions, or it can be a reflection of his current state of fear and jumpiness. What matters is that the character (and player) aren't choosing the two dozen options that involve <b>not</b> shooting the guy (e.g., running away). Whatever decisions and intentions that character has made, he's committed to using violence.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458161/#Comment_458161" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-17T16:52:38+00:00" title="November 17, 2016  4:52PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the sake of clarity, we should also be careful to distinguish "intention" from related, but distinct phenomena, such as motive, impulse, passion, etc. <br/><br/>In particular, we're not helping things by equivocating between "intention" and "emotional state."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458163/#Comment_458163" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-17T17:21:58+00:00" title="November 17, 2016  5:21PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2016 5:25PM by Paul_T.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, this is getting interesting. Can I renew my request to try to stick to the gist of people's arguments, though? Nit-picking examples isn't really helping anyone, here, and it's making me feel like we're miscommunicating completely.<br/><br/>For example:\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>(For that matter, I even wrote, above, that the declaration of intent is the *best* match for triggering the 'go aggro' move.)</blockquote>\nYou said that _player_ intent was the best match for triggering the go aggro move. I am talking about _character_ intent. They are not the same thing.<br/></blockquote>\nHere is my original quote (with the relevant bit bolded):\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote><br/>i.e. contrast 'I'm gonna shoot this guy if he doesn't get out of the car' with 'I am going to threaten this guy with my gun so he gets out of the car'.<br/></blockquote>\nThe former is *not* a "fictional trigger". It's a statement of <b>character intentions</b>, but we have *no* idea what's actually happening on-screen. Is she talking? Shouting? Just being menacing? Is the gun drawn and pointed, or holstered?<br/></blockquote>\nI'd love to keep this discussion friendly, instead of jumping on each other's phrasing or critiquing examples.<br/><br/>That said:<br/><br/>I firmly believe that character vs. player intent is a total red herring here. I mean, we all remember that the character doesn't really exist, right? <br/><br/>(Or can you honestly tell me you have situations in your games where character intent overrides player intent? That sounds incredibly bizarre to me. "I really don't want to 'go aggro' here, but I guess that's what my character is doing. Damn, sucks for me.")<br/><br/>So, let's drop the character/player intent distinction - I think it's ludicrous (or, at worst, interchangeable).<br/><br/>Great points about the necessity of intent being present in AW moves in general, however. I agree with that in full. Same goes for the two-way relationship between fiction and intent when making moves - it's our responsibility to ask what and how (although many people do not do so, in practice). Good stuff.<br/><br/>Now, also keep in mind that I haven't read the clarifying text for 2nd Ed (is it true, as implied above, that 'seize by force' is handled differently in 2nd Ed?). If I'm missing something from there, I'd love to know, though!<br/><br/>What are the requirements, in your game, for 'go aggro' to happen, and how do you deal with the possible sticking points I talked about at the beginning of the thread?<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458165/#Comment_458165" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-17T17:34:14+00:00" title="November 17, 2016  5:34PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps another way to think about it:<br/><br/>What, for you, would be the perfect "explanatory text" for this move?

It looks like you've narrowed down "fictional trigger" to "concrete observable actions in the fiction", but my point is: if we assumed that, then we wouldn't be able to trigger <i>a lot</i> of AW moves fiction-first, not just Go aggro.<br/>Just as characters are fictional entities, their intents, intentions, impulses and motives are part of the fiction (even if you <i>don't</i> talk about them all the time the way IceCreamEmperor advocates, but only mention them when asked for a clarifying statement), and just as much as those things are part of the fiction they can be part of what counts as a "fictional trigger" - why not?<br/>In fact, to reiterate my point, when I stopped and thought about it I noticed fictional intents or motives are part of the fictional trigger for most if not all basic moves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458180/#Comment_458180" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-18T02:31:24+00:00" title="November 18, 2016  2:31AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with that completely.

It changes the feeling of play fairly dramatically. It doesn't mean to ignore intent, no; just to look at actual fictional actions on the part of the characters, as well, and to make that an important part of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458182/#Comment_458182" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-18T08:39:42+00:00" title="November 18, 2016  8:39AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2016 8:43AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uh, the thing you quoted is a thing you said several posts after what I was referring to, which was what got me talking about this at all in the first place. It's not nit-picking, I'm just trying to explain why I am even talking about this. If you read my second post in this thread you can see where I am quoting you as saying that player intention is key to whether Go Aggro is triggered. That is the original quote, to which I was referring.<br/><br/>I really don't understand how character intent vs. player intent can be a red herring in a conversation about the fictional trigger for a move, which is what I was trying to address in that particular exchange. The fact that the character exists only in the fiction is not an argument against this distinction being relevant, it is an argument for it. Some things players say are relevant to the fiction, some things they say are not; only the former triggers moves. <br/><br/>Anyways, it's not really clear to me what if any disagreement remains. miedvied's characterisation of the process is exactly what I was referring to in my original post in the thread. Paul, you suggested that it was not super relevant to what you felt the thread was about, so I'm curious what that thing is. Are we just back to, like, 'is the text explaining Go Aggro adequately clear'?<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458183/#Comment_458183" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-18T08:42:38+00:00" title="November 18, 2016  8:42AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2016 8:43AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Double post.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458262/#Comment_458262" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-23T18:42:06+00:00" title="November 23, 2016  6:42PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We have, indeed, wandered into pretty murky territory with this thread now.

No harm done, they're still learning.<br/><br/>* If they're holding onto their dice because they think their character might be bluffing, but they aren't sure yet, no sweat. They should hold off making any roll until they've figured it out for themselves. This means that we pause the game and sit there patiently until they tell us which: proceed, not bluffing; proceed, bluffing; or back up and do something else instead.

In fact, it's implicitly built into the conversational dynamic of the move. You DO use that option pretty much all the time, it's just that you rarely make it explicit.<br/><br/>The first two of these following examples are obvious, clear cut, and so conceal the implicit working of the move. The third and fourth are ambiguous, and so provide hints. Taken together, I hope they'll show you what I mean.<br/><br/><i>Player</i>: Tell me where the girl is, NOW.<br/><i>MC</i>: Okay! Okay! She's hiding out at Dremmer's.<br/><i>Player</i>: Awesome. Thanks, buddy.<br/>Implicit: the player counts it as caving.<br/><br/><i>Player</i>: Tell me where the girl is, NOW.<br/><i>MC</i>: You can go lick a mudfish you piece of -<br/><i>Player</i>: Yeah I blow his brains out.<br/>Implicit: the player counts it as forcing her hand.<br/><br/><i>Player</i>: Tell me where the girl is, NOW.<br/><i>MC</i>: Wait! God wait! She begged me to tell you that she's safe but she can't trust ANYBODY right now, because she thinks Tum Tum can read minds or something! Don't shoot me!<br/><i>Player</i>: Huh. ...Yeah. Okay, that makes sense.<br/>Implicit: the player counts it as caving.<br/><br/><i>Player</i>: Tell me where the girl is, NOW.<br/><i>MC</i>: Wait! God wait! She begged me to tell you that she's safe but she can't trust ANYBODY right now, because she thinks Tum Tum can read minds or something! Don't shoot me!<br/><i>Player</i>: Tell me RIGHT NOW!<br/><i>MC</i>: No I swear to god -<br/><i>Player</i>: Yeah I blow his brains out.<br/>Implicit: the player counts it as forcing her hand.<br/><br/>See how "well, here's what he does, is it caving or is it forcing your hand?" is built into the rhythm of the exchange? It's only when the circumstances are ambiguous AND you think the player doesn't realize that it's her judgment to make, that you'd bother to make it explicit by asking.\n<blockquote>Why shouldn't I always choose to "bluff"?</blockquote>\nIf you want to bluff, bluff. If you don't want to bluff, don't bluff. In any case where you find "bluffing" to be the better move, you should "bluff," it's fine by me.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458344/#Comment_458344" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-25T19:05:27+00:00" title="November 25, 2016  7:05PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Just my two cents...

That's what I meant. Excellent catch.<br/><br/>When it comes to AW:<br/><br/>With "threats of violence" in general, there are two places where things feel like they don't line up what's happening "on screen".<br/><br/>1. I decide to threaten someone with a gun, to affect their behaviour. This sounds like a pretty straightforward "go aggro".<br/><br/>However, the character is holding back - talking instead of shooting right away - because she benefits by delaying the decision (to kill or not to kill), giving her better options. She can see the victim's reactions, and then decide what to do.<br/><br/>The wording of the 'go aggro' move, however, suggests that the choice is up to the victim: do you cave or force their hand? <br/><br/>If we were to rewrite the move like so, would it match your vision of how it should be used, or would it go against it?<br/><br/>-On a 10+, they must choose: cave or force your hand. Then you can decide to carry out the threat after all, or not, as you wish: if you've got them right there. [Fictional circumstances permitting, of course.]<br/><br/>2. I decide to threaten someone with a gun, to affect their behaviour. However, I'm not willing to shoot them - I'm bluffing.<br/><br/>I roll a 7-9, and the victim says, "Ok, I'll do it, but put down your gun first." Now, narratively, this a tense moment. If I put down my gun, I'm trusting the 'victim': I'm taking them at their word, and risking giving up an advantage I have for a chance to get what I want.<br/><br/>Of course, it's tense, because what if the 'victim' is planning to attack me, after all?<br/><br/>However, having just rolled the move, we know that no such thing will happen - the outcome is agreed-upon. I put down the gun; they do as I say. This has benefits of clarity, of course, and benefits in terms of getting on with the game, but the tension inherent in that moment is gone as soon as the deal is made, since the other player wouldn't be playing kosher if they went back on the decision they just made.<br/><br/>How do you handle this in your games? Or do recommend people handle this kind of thing?<br/><br/>Is it just a limitation of the medium (and the moves' design), or is there a better way to handle this I just haven't spotted yet?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458431/#Comment_458431" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-30T01:28:16+00:00" title="November 30, 2016  1:28AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2016 1:28AM by lumpley.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. Ugh. Yeah, no. One of the points of going aggro's design is, don't raise a gun if you don't mean it. I designed it contra to that kind of threat on purpose. You should write a custom move if you want to support it.<br/><br/>Either way, in your proposed rewrite, you've still reversed the matter at judgment. You get to decide whether to pull the trigger when <i>their answer</i> is ambiguous, not when your commitment is. When your commitment's ambiguous, you haven't rolled the dice yet.<br/><br/>2. An NPC getting you to agree to lower your gun and then attacking you should be a miss, not a hit, so that's how it works on NPCs.<br/><br/>Try it on another PC, though, and you get that moment of tension even on a 10+.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20709/aws-go-aggro-trigger" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20709/aws-go-aggro-trigger" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20709/aws-go-aggro-trigger/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20709/aws-go-aggro-trigger/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20709/aws-go-aggro-trigger/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20709%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20709%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>AW's Go Aggro trigger - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20709/aws-go-aggro-trigger/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="AW's Go Aggro trigger - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20709/aws-go-aggro-trigger/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Ok, thanks, Vincent.

That's what I thought, so your answer clarifies it for me.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why your rewritten example, above (your second to last post), is legit then, however. <br/><br/>Giving this move this good deal of dissection and analysis has been very revealing, and very thought-provoking. Perhaps someday we'll have a version which allows us to get around these sticking points. "Go aggro" covers so much different ground, and, in clever way, gets to be able to do all these different things (as you pointed out with the implicit dynamic of the actor judging the response of the victim), but I feel pretty confident that I've covered the various sticking points in this thread, even if I don't have solutions for them.<br/><br/>Vincent, did you have any thoughts on my idea that different rolled results on a 'go aggro' move refer to different positions within the IIEE of resolution (again, if you have a preferred term for this other than IIEE, let me know)? Do you play this way? It seems like a good technique to fix some of this weirdness, in any case.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458441/#Comment_458441" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-30T11:06:55+00:00" title="November 30, 2016 11:06AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You don't see how the npc's answer is ambiguous?<br/><br/>But yes!

Roll+hard. On a 7-9, they react instinctively and have a split second to run, dodge, dive for cover, or try to get you to stop. On a 10+, they get one chance to totally cave before you hit them, and that's only if they want it.<br/><br/>The game takes a philosophical position on violence: <i>a threat is an attack</i> and <i>guns go off</i>. Idle threats become, in the heat of the moment and with the spike of adrenalin, real. If you have your character point a gun at something, <i>she might shoot it</i>, even if you didn't really want her to.

That's a very interesting rewrite. It clarifies the "fictional trigger" dramatically, as well as the IIEE positioning, as well as the character's commitment to the action. In exchange, it's not as flexible. Right?<br/><br/>In terms of philosophical position:<br/><br/>I've always liked AW's implications around violence. Your final paragraph is talking about the game as-written, right? "Go aggro" does that very nicely, in that it takes the choice out of the acting character's hands, and implies a number of things about people's self-control, as well as about the nature of violence.<br/><br/>The challenge is making that line up seamlessly with the fiction. Some people don't care about that; for them, it's no problem. For the people who do, though (and occasionally with newbies), it can cause hiccups. (And we all know how hard it is to make hiccups go away!)<br/><br/>What's this thread about?<br/><br/>My initial contention in this thread is that "go aggro" is, itself, a challenging term. It's nicely descriptive, but it's an <i>expression</i>. Unlike many of the other moves, it's very open to interpretation: what does it mean to <i>go aggro</i>? You might think it's one thing, and your friend might think it's another. I'm quite fond of the phrase, and it's <b>perfect</b> for this... but it doesn't help us define the parameters of the move. In comparison, many (most?) other moves have a pretty descriptive, uh, description ("When you try to overtake another vehicle..." -&gt; we all know immediately what that looks like and what kinds of things you might do to achieve it).<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458456/#Comment_458456" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-30T21:17:34+00:00" title="November 30, 2016  9:17PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2016 9:33PM by Paul_T.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, now I'm thinking about how player-facing "moves" are engaged in a game (whether AW or another PbtA game; many will have different needs, of course). <br/><br/>I've seen different groups do it differently, and I think there are a variety of functional ways to do so. Here are some (all?) of the ways I've seen:<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>First, the preamble. Cosmetically (who talks?):<br/><br/>A. Players describe what their character says and does, and perhaps their intentions. It's the MC, however, who says when a move should be rolled. <br/><br/>"Ok, sounds like you're going aggro. Wanna roll it, or do something else?"<br/><br/>(Vincent had a very nice, economical phrase for this earlier in this conversation: "Cool. Roll it!" That's only three words, and gets us on the same page. Nice.)<br/><br/>Some people like this approach because they find it immersive, and because it demands that a fictional description for the action happens, every time.<br/><br/>I cringe a little bit at the lack of player empowerment here, but as long as the decision is seen as open to discussion (i.e. the MC is in charge of <i>saying it</i>, but really it's up to group consensus), it can work for many groups. Feels very familiar for "traditional gamers", as well, if they're coming from a culture of playing games where the GM always calls for rolls.<br/><br/>B. The player is in charge of announcing when they want to make a move (generally, although anyone can speak up if it seems like they clearly have met the requirements, and have forgotten).<br/><br/>This is very practical; generally it's the player who's making the decision, so it's the most direct and efficient way to get from point A to point B.<br/><br/>However, it's also easy for some groups to skip out on talking about the fiction. AW's moves cover the needs pretty well (e.g. 'go aggro' requires you to specify what you're threatening your enemy with), but for some groups that's not descriptive enough, and they feel like they've fallen into a trap, and their gaming is now less detailed. <br/><br/>(I've seen several groups complain that when they play AW they fall into a pattern of just saying "I go aggro with my gun!" and "I manipulate him, with the promise of a nice meal", skipping much of the narration, and they feel like the game's gotten a bit "thin".)<br/><br/><i>Vincent covers this distinction nicely in the thread I link below.</i><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Ok, so that's who talks. Fine. But how do we decide when a move is actually to be made? When do we reach for the dice? Whether it's the MC, or the player, or anyone at all, <b>what are the criteria for the decision</b>? That's the real meat of the question.<br/><br/>I have seen three different, somewhat overlapping ways:<br/><br/><br/>1. The option to make a move is purely the player's decision. <br/><br/>I want to 'go aggro', so I do. If necessary, we then ask for additional information ("How do you do that?"), but it's very much my option and my prerogative, as a player in the game. The moves are, effectively, my "buttons" in this game - the things I can do, and doing so is my right. <br/><br/>I may have to convince others that it's appropriate to the fictional circumstances in some occasions, but the default assumption is that I make my moves when I want to. The <i>fictional description</i> here is not *structural*: it's your responsibility to do so as the player, but it's for our pleasure and interest, not because the game demands it.<br/><br/>The basic flow of play is: <br/><br/>I pick a move; the others might ask me to tell them about what my character is doing in the fiction to justify that move.<br/><br/>If we're talking in terms of IIEE or something like that, its position is fairly loose within the resolution process. <br/><br/>A perfect example of a move which operates this way by default is "read the sitch". Trying to adjudicate that move by method 2 (below) is messy and awkward.<br/><br/><br/><i>If I had to guess, I would say that this is closest to Vincent's vision for AW. (See <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=8689.0" rel="nofollow">apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=8689.0</a>.)<br/><br/>What's the catch? It's "if you do it, do it": that suggests that there is a "fictional trigger", and I <b>cannot</b> introduce that fictional material (e.g. threaten someone with a gun) without rolling the move. That complicates matters a little bit, or, at least, requires some clarity for what the "fictional triggers" for each move are.</i><br/><br/><br/>2. Moves are strictly triggered by fictional events and/or circumstances.<br/><br/>This is typically easiest to see with custom moves: "When you drink Dremmer's moonshine, roll+weird..."<br/><br/>Moves with mechanical or procedural triggers are right here, too ("When your Hx reaches +4, reset and...").<br/><br/>In this view, every move has a strict "trigger", and when that thing happens, you roll the dice. When X happens in the fiction, we make move Y.<br/><br/>With Dremmer's moonshine, there's no wiggle room: either you're drinking it or not, and that's that. It's not up to anyone in particular: when this happens, we roll the dice.<br/><br/><br/><i>The challenge here is, of course, that not all fictional triggers are as clear as taking a sip of a drink. (And even there we might have some debate about whether just having a little drop does the trick, or whether you have to down a whole cup.)<br/><br/>In addition, some moves may or may not suit all situations. This depends on how the move is designed, of course. Do the outcomes suit the situation? Do the player decisions? How flexible to interpretation are the outcomes?<br/><br/>This option has, generally, the clearest position in play in terms of IIEE.</i><br/><br/><br/>3. Moves are applied by the group to give the desired outcomes, or force the desired choices, in a particular fictional situation.<br/><br/>In this view, the move is a procedure we throw into play when it gives us what we want. <br/><br/>The fiction we're imagining moves forward, and we invent various details and narrate various actions, but we can occasionally go to one of these processes to "disclaim responsibility" or shake things up.<br/><br/>The basic flow is that we learn the structure and outcomes of the moves, and then call on them when they seem like a good fit for what's happening "on screen". Do the outcomes and choices of this move suit what's happening?<br/><br/>The moves are almost an artist's brush, in this view, used to punctuate the fiction and to emphasize certain moments in specific ways.<br/><br/>A perfect example here from AW is the harm move. Most people (from what I've seen) call on it opportunistically. Essentially, it's "Hey! It would be fun to roll for harm right now. Let's do it!" On the other hand, if it seems like it might get in the way or draw attention away from the action, we might skip it altogether this time.<br/><br/>I find a lot of Monsterhearts' moves work best this way. Here's an example I posted in an <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/408427/#Comment_408427" rel="nofollow">earlier thread</a>: one person has dropped their glasses and is scrambling to find them, half-blind. Another person comes forward, and steps on the glasses, crushing them. Although it doesn't really suit the description of either move, we found that "lash out" and "shut someone down" were both great options here. Calling on either move gave mechanical weight to the moment and punctuated the story in a powerful way.<br/><br/><br/><i>The issue here, of course, is the lack of clarity. It's a slippery slope from here to just deciding arbitrarily when to roll any given move. Not only in terms of when to call for the move in the flow of play (IIEE, etc), but also whether we do so at all, and which move. That's not going to help the group find their groove or avoid disagreements - at its worst, taken to an extreme, it's unprincipled and unpredictable play operating purely by consensus.)</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458457/#Comment_458457" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-30T21:19:23+00:00" title="November 30, 2016  9:19PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2016 9:34PM by Paul_T.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A clarifying note to keep Story Games accessible to people who don't know jargon: "IIEE" is an old Forge term for "what we must establish before we roll the dice, and what we establish afterwards". For instance, if we "roll to hit", does that mean your character has already swung the sword, or just that she <i>intends to</i>? <br/><br/>(This matters if, for example, we want to know if another player or character can interrupt the action before it happens.)<br/><br/><br/><i>In the case of 'go aggro', it seems that most respondents (in this thread) apply a combination of these factors to decide when to roll. For instance, we certainly need some kind of threat or attack to be made, but we also need to know that the player is committing to the potential outcomes, or the flow can be broken and we need a do-over. <br/><br/><i>The awkward conversation I've seen is: <br/>-"I threaten him with my gun!" <br/>-"Ok, roll go aggro!" <br/>-"I got a 10+" <br/>-"He laughs in your face and you shoot him..." <br/>-"Wait!

As Vincent said, when you roll the dice for the Move, that's like taking your fingers off the chess piece, you've committed.

In fact, it's why "Go Aggro" in AW 1e was such a problem.  Vincent broke his own principle.  For "Go Aggro" to apply it's not enough that I say, "I stick a gun in his face and demand he tells me where my sister is or I'll blow his head off."  The MC has to additionally clarify, "Do you mean it?"  Because "Go Aggro" doesn't cover bluffing.  You have to be willing to actually blow his head off.<br/><br/>So we can't go straight from declaration to move we have to intercede and double check willingness to follow through.

I think sometimes these tools are conscious, like interpreting Read a Person as spotting tells, and spending Holds only as they come up in roleplayed conversation rather than as a pick list... and sometimes they're unconscious, like interpreting the wording of a move in the way that seems to make sense in that moment.

If there's a discussion about "do you have leverage?" or "are you persuasive enough to get them to budge?" that feels too much like setting stakes or discussing what success looks like, at which point you might as well just switch to playing Blades in the Dark (in my opinion)."<br/><br/>I thought that was quite interesting.<br/><br/>It pretty well nails one of the things I was trying to get at in this thread: <i>go aggro</i> operates in this funny double space between, "As a player, this is a move you can make when you're willing and able to hurt someone, and there's something you want them to do", and "You're going aggro on the dude? Sweet, roll it."<br/><br/>I can imagine that, after a few awkward interactions, the players simply internalize the use of the move and avoid making it when it's not appropriate. However, I'd love to have a clearer condition for triggering the move, making play smoother.<br/><br/>The same thing can happen with the "manipulate" move (i.e. the discussion about whether you have leverage or not), but that's not as much trouble, since it's easy to simply say the move hasn't been made yet, and go on with free play.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20709/aws-go-aggro-trigger/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20709/aws-go-aggro-trigger">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20709/aws-go-aggro-trigger/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20709/aws-go-aggro-trigger/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20709%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20709%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
