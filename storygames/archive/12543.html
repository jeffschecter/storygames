I would like to bring forth a couple of ideas I've been mulling over in my mind for a while now. I'm currently working on two RPG projects, <i>Seasons: Spring</i> and <i>Navigators</i>, and I've been actively trying to work more on theme and tight mechanics that support that theme, rather than relying on older design elements. With that in mind, I've been looking at some things that I would normally take for granted in games and replacing them with newer (to my mind, of course) ideas. This particularly came to a head while working on <i>Spring</i>, and I decided my base premise and theme for the game would be "it's not what you do, it's what you do it <i>for</i>."<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's gotten me thinking which, as you'll be able to tell shortly (if you haven't already), is generally not good for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the main advantages that people have always proclaimed RPGs and Story Games have over computer games (in general) and MMORPGs (in particular) in my experience is that it allows you do do anything, not just what's programmed into the game. But that's a little disingenuous, isn't it? All characters in the game are defined by what they can do, or can affect, whether it's through skills, attributes, scene framing, narrative control or whatever, not to mention the conceits of the setting and GM approval. To put it in a little bit of a hyperbole, few people I know, certainly, would suggest their character can leap over Mt. Everest in a realistic horror game, and fewer would just declare that they cause the main antagonist of the game to keel over dead, thus robbing the game of important conflict. We're constrained and restricted by the mechanics and the setting, so how is that really different from MMORPGs? As soon as you put restrictions on anything, you rob the players the ability to do <i>anything</i> (of course, I would not suggest that this means they can do <i>nothing</i>)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if it's not "what you can do," than what is the intrinsic advantage to RPGs as a media?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm currently toying with the idea that the main strength is that the media allows you to define what is important to you in the fictional world, in terms of how you can affect the world, and, perhaps just as importantly, <i>why</i> you can affect it in such a way. I think this is something that no other interactive media allows. Any thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281580/#Comment_281580" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T07:56:36+00:00" title="July 19, 2010  7:56AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello, Will. I remember Seasons: Spring from over on RPG.net, I made a sheet for you. It seems like a really nice game idea that shows promise. That aside...<br><br>As a semi-aside: Vincent Baker had some posts on this a while back where he pointed out that the character sheet is not about the character, it's not even about what a character can do. The sheet is a reminder of the resources the <i>player</i> has at his disposal to influence the game. The fact that these resources are traditionally limited to what a character can do is just a historical coincidence and in no way mandatory. Yes, most games will limit the player's power to his character. You can act on the world (and story) through your character and no more. This is cool, it is not obligatory of course.<br><br>"To do anything" is a silly claim. Most RPGs that I know that claim they allow you to "do anything" are not particularly interesting games either. We don't want to play "anything" for a variety of reasons: vagueness, choice paralysis, lack of coherence...We want to play "something". Something needs focus. When we play we use various tools at our disposal to agree on things: mechanics, social contract, setting, unspoken agreements, common interests...a whole plethora of things that help us come together in creating the in-game world. This is a tough job. You have to synchronize the expectations, agendas and imaginations of a bunch of different people. This is why a lot of games and groups fall apart...it just never comes together. Not jumping over Mt. Everest is a judgement call (or even a skill roll or whatever) we have to make based on all those considerations and expectations of what the game is supposed to be like.<br><br>It's not what the <i>characters</i> can do. It's about we as <i>players</i> can do. Yes, <i>we</i> can do anything. We can play Call of Cthulhu. We can play Star Wars and change the story of the prequels. We can make our own world. Sometimes we can jump over Mt. Everest and sometimes we just die in vain from a stray bullet. Most importantly...we can create stories, we can play, we can socialize. Those are very important drives that come together while we play RPGs with our friends and don't really connect in most other activities. <br><br>We put restrictions on our characters, and ourselves (by limiting out game-affecting powers) as tools that help us create what we want. Rules, limitations, options are cool. They foster creativity, they direct attention, they favoritize outcomes and procedures, point us in a direction. That's all super-useful for creative endeavours. Rules are also important as part of agon, competitive play, because they set the boundaries within which we compete.<br/><br/>And yeah, obviously, it's an interactive medium. <i>You</i> define things. <i>We</i> define things. On all the steps of the way, from choosing or designing a game to making a choice for your character it's all about making choices. Sometimes optimized choices (tactics, gamism), sometimes correct choices (verisimilitude, simulationsim), sometimes difficult thematic choices (story, narrativism).<br/><br/>Got on a bit of a rant here...I'll stop now.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will%20Edge" title="Will Edge"><img alt="Will Edge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will%20Edge">Will Edge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281585/#Comment_281585" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T08:03:47+00:00" title="July 19, 2010  8:03AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, yes, I remember!

Burning Wheel focuses on motivations/beliefs a lot, some of the stats in 'In a Wicked Age' are motivations rather than strict abilities (e.g. 'for myself' or 'for others'), and "My Life With Master" is all about your minion's motivations and desires. There's lots of good stuff to check out to give you some ideas, and I look forward to seeing what you do with that notion.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will%20Edge" title="Will Edge"><img alt="Will Edge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will%20Edge">Will Edge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281740/#Comment_281740" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T13:30:54+00:00" title="July 19, 2010  1:30PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, "In A Wicked Age" was one of the major inspirations on this subject.
