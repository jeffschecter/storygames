Doing it as a hidden process makes people feel vulnerable ("What ELSE can they do without me knowing?"). Sure it may be the right thing for Amazon to do (more to that below), but is it equally "right" to attempt to hide the fact by not informing folks? Suppose my purchase information is out of date, because I used a debit card that I've subsequently lost? (I imagine they figure that out and try to email folks, to be sure they get refunds. But still...)<br><br>* On a related note, if Amazon missed that for 1984 and Animal Farm (not exactly "unknown" works), then how many other pirate downloads are lurking out there? Is this the first of many "clean ups"? Am I, as a publisher, now beholden to check Amazon regularly for an illegal sale, or do I rely on them to inform me? Or would they even inform me, or just kill the pirate downloads and do refunds? (Maybe I'd LIKE to know that umtpy-fifty folks DLed a pirate copy, so i could pursue a legal sale with them?)<br><br>* Which reminds me... as of press time, the two books in question were not released by the actual copyright holder in e-reader format. So if I, say, HAD to finish it by an afternoon  class today, and I woke up to find it's totally gone... well, let's hope the bookstore is open and stocked or I am well and truly screwed.<br><br>* And, thus, it's nothing like what would happen for you with Universalis, because you're going to release Universalis on Amazon in their AZW format, right? Right? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br><br>* Oh, uh, not-so-finally, there's a reasonable argument that these books should be in the public domain: 1984 is published in 1949, Orwell dies in 1950, it's been 59 years since that date, and copyright law (used to?) protect for "author's life plus fifty years" according to the Berne Convention. Ah, wait, "50 years minimum," so I suppose whoever holds his estate ATM has more than 59 years on the books.<br><br>Which is why stacks and stacks of them sell every year around Back To School time, instead of Guternberg.org having it for free download to nearly any device.<br><br>So anyhow, I don't think it's an "uproar" for the average joe who probably forgot that he had it on his Kindle (and, thus, I reassert that it's DUMB for the estate holders to pull them rather than just offer their version and let Amazon do transfer. Publicly, not hidden, so folks could take the transfer OR get their money back--win, win, win, win). There *is* a bit of uproar for folks who appreciate transparency when their "purchased" data is tampered with, even for the "best" of reasons (protecting a 59 year old IP that's considered Standard Reading in our democracy and many others).<br/>-----<br/>It's probably another thread, but I can get a netbook that SMOKES the Kindle for $300, including having a better keyboard and other input devices, larger and higher resolution screen, and FAR more functionality. And my choice of OS. And freedom from being silently reconfigured anytime I'm connected online. All a Kindle wins on is weight and battery life, which I will readily concede is an issue for some folks doing a lot of digital reading (just not for me--I tend to hold my laptop like a large graphic novel, when reading... and I could use the exercise, anyway).<br/><br/>Glad you dig it, Ralph. I'm sure it's handy for some folks, especially folks who already have netbooks or laptops or for folks who JUST want a reader and want it to work without any need (or, truly, any ability) to configure it. But I'd be looking for it to cost nearly nothing, if I were going to buy just to then only be able to buy content (though, if it surfs the web well enough, that's a non-issue; especially if I can go to Gutenberg or my Googel Docs or favorite blogs).<br/><br/>But, again, "Is the Kindle worth the money" isn't the subtext of how I (tongue-in-cheek--recognize the allusion to DitV?) title this thread. It's more the entire digital distribution model established by Amazon, and their lack of transparency, and their attempt (it seems) to try to sell devices in an age when services are soon to be king (AKA Web 3.0). I wouldn't try to start a "Kindle-only" distribution model, these days, for instance....                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219825/#Comment_219825" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T11:30:54+00:00" title="July 21, 2009 11:30AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2009 11:33AM by renatoram.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Marginally IT, but copyright used to last 70 years after *publication* until some date I don't remember, then it become 70 years after the death of the author.<br/>\nA treaty, btw, made the copyright last only as much as the earliest deadline, in case of international use.

It's designed for a completely different reason and the two devices shouldn't be compared. If you try and use it as a netbook of course you're going to be disappointed. E-books are for reading, plain and simple. Some do other things too (mine can be used as a notepad) but their principle purpose is to read. For this purpose, a netbook is not so well suited. Reading on a backlit screen is uncomfortable, causes eye strain, and is difficult to read in bright daylight. A modern e-book uses e-ink technology in its display. While this only allows for greyscale images to be displayed, the screen does not need to be lit and is viewable from any angle, providing a paper-like display. This doesn't hurt the eyes to read from, even at great length. Also the batteries last much, much longer because the display only draws power when the page is turned.<br/><br/>Anyway, I don't have a Kindle, thank goodness. I have an iRex iLiad. Even more expensive, but a much larger screen and a lot of extras including reading PDFs properly, not some cut-down proprietary poor man's equivalent <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> Not that I'm a tech-snob or anything.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219850/#Comment_219850" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T12:38:04+00:00" title="July 21, 2009 12:38PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you haven't seen it before, please check out <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html" rel="nofollow">The Right to Read</a>.<br/><br/>Then go off and scoff at it, but at least you won't be able to say you weren't warned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219871/#Comment_219871" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T13:16:25+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  1:16PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2009 1:25PM by johnzo.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite><br/>On what planet of crazy entitlement nonsense do people truly believe they have the right to possess <b>illegal</b> materials with no action to recover those materials being taken?</blockquote>\n(emphasis mine)<br/><br/>You have a touching faith in the non-fuckheadedness of lawmakers, Ralph.<br/><br/>Hypothetically: I write a game called <i>Divinity Gone Wild</i> about the exploits of Mecha-Christ and his TechnoAngels in the dark future of the CyberTribulation.  Say this game becomes popular in Ireland, selling hundreds of Kindle copies there.  Say the government of Ireland <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/07/20/f-ireland-blasphemy-law.html" rel="nofollow">passes a law that criminalizes my work.</a>  Amazon, being a good corporate citizen, deletes all the sold copies from my Irish customers' Kindles.  AWESOME!  And then Amazon, being an extra-good corporate citizen (Amazon gets crazy tax benefits from Ireland; there's a big dev center there) also throws some recognition strings into the pdf translator (which they control) so my Irish customers can't even convert my PDF edition into something that can be read on the Kindle.  DOUBLE AWESOME.<br/><br/>But that's not all!  Because Amazon is good to customers, it provides a refund to them.  What does the fine print in the contract say about repaying my Kindle royalties if I wind up selling illegal material through it?  So they'll not only uncustomer a bunch of my fans, they'll also probably chargeback my Irish Kindle royalties.  TRIPLE AWESOME!<br/><br/>Or, say Amazon just doesn't want the bother of localizing the Kindle to hundreds of different jurisdiction's obscenity laws, and just decides to not accept anything that might be banned anywhere.  That's an awesome outcome too.<br/><br/>In conclusion: vertical integration sucks, especially when enabled by backdoored hardware.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219875/#Comment_219875" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T13:22:36+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  1:22PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2009 1:28PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Amazon screwed up by offering for sale a digitial copy of a book without ensuring that the seller of the book actually had the rights to sell it.

Under the "right of first sale" in the U.S., people can do whatever they like with a book after purchasing it, including giving it to a friend or reselling it. There is no option for a bookseller to take that book back once it's sold.</blockquote>\nThis, by the way, is what the uproar is about.  Those people who bought <i>1984</i> for their Kindle were not engaged in piracy: they purchased what they assumed was a legitimate copy from Amazon.  Amazon in turn was selling what it assumed was a legitimate copy from MobileReference.  When MobileReference turned out to be pirates, Amazon's duty was to stop selling that version of <i>1984</i>, MobileReference's duty was to stop pirating the book, and the duty of the actual holders of the copyright was to pursue whatever legal course they wanted to against MobileReference and/or Amazon.<br/><br/>But the people who bought the book?  They aren't pirates.  They aren't running off copies of their MobileReference <i>1984</i> and passing them out to other people (if that's even possible to do with a Kindle), they're just people who bought a book in good faith.  And again, if it were a pirate edition of a paperback, Amazon wouldn't be entitled to take those copies back from those good-faith buyers.  They could ask the buyers to return the books for a refund, I suppose, but they wouldn't be able to demand it.  They certainly wouldn't be able to sneak into people's libraries and steal the book back, even if they left the owners a refund.<br/><br/>Then again, these aren't paperbacks.  Hell if I know whether they're allowed to delete them remotely or not.  Given the way the DMCA was set up, they probably are allowed to, and everything everyone ever does on a Kindle is actually illegal and punishable by huge fines anyway.<br/><br/><br/>I think the Kindle is all kinds of awesome, myself, but this incident does drive home an important point:  if you want the security of genuinely owning something that cannot be taken away from you at any moment for reasons you probably aren't even entitled to know, you need to have it in hardcopy.  Electronic versions can be taken away from you at any time, and you won't be able to do anything about it besides stomp your feet and complain.  But man, when the laws applying to print were written, citizens actually had <i>rights</i>, and somehow those rights haven't been taken away yet.

In the current case it was a violation of existing law that there was a reasonable expectation on Amazon to abide by.  In your example its changing law for which there is no expectation for Amazon to correct prior practice.  It wasn't a mistake for Amazon to sell what it sold when it sold it...as it is in case of 1984.  Its pretty apples and oranges.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I'm a free market guy.  If Amazon did act in the way you fear and that in the long run doesn't cost them any business...then clearly your fears are a minority view and thus suck only to you and a handful of others to few to matter.  If it does cost Amazon business then they'll either adapt to the demands of the market place or a competitor will.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I guess ultimately, your decision to enter wide sales distribution in a foreign market where you are not attuned to the political situation (or you are and chose to do it anyway)...is really ultimately your risk to bear, no?  I mean situations like this are why real companies have local attorneys and funds escrowed to deal with unexpected cash flow losses.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we as a small publisher can't afford such self protection and aren't willing to take the risk, then we should probably not enter into a distribution agreement which allows royalty charge backs on overseas sales...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219889/#Comment_219889" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T13:51:49+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  1:51PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I think the Kindle is all kinds of awesome, myself, but this incident does drive home an important point: if you want the security of genuinely owning something that cannot be taken away from you at any moment for reasons you probably aren't even entitled to know, you need to have it in hardcopy.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nWell duh...that's what I'm talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course you should have zero expectation that you genuinely own something that cannot be taken away from you.  You aren't buying a book.  You're buying a right to read a book.  Just like when you buy a song from I-tunes.  You're not buying an album...you're buying a right to listen to that album (and until recently...only on approved devices).  When you buy an App for your cell phone you're not buying the software, you're buying the use of that software on that phone. Most phone Apps are non replaceable and non transferrable when you get a new phone...so you're actually only buying the use of that App while you own that phone (in most cases).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you buy your favorite game at Best Buy you aren't actually buying a product...you're buying a license to use that product.  Go ahead a read the terms of the licensing agreement that most people skip over when they install their games...its pretty clear what rights you don't have...and its been like that for decades.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople aren't buying Kindle's in a vaccuum.  I can't believe there's that many people buying a Kindle who've never bought any of the above things.  This isn't new.  The whole notion of "I paid for it, therefor its mine and I can do what I want with it" hasn't been true since the 1980s.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou paid for it, therefor you can use it. But only in the prescribed manner they allow and with whatever restrictions they place and for however long they permit...as outlined in all that legal text nobody bothers to read.  That's been true of an increasing volume of things people have been buying for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't like the "pay for a license" model...but it ain't going away anytime soon.  Any one who bought a Kindle expecting it to be otherwise is a fool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley" title="Jack Aidley"><img alt="Jack Aidley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley">Jack Aidley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219891/#Comment_219891" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T13:53:13+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  1:53PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, Ralph, would you be okay with this situation: you buy a book from a store in good faith.

Divinity Gone Wild could even have been sold for YEARS before morality laws compelled Amazon to retro-cull it. Hell, the publisher could no longer exist--royalty checks going ever uncashed (and never recovered from the Dead Letter Office of some municipality). Or maybe Amazon just pushes a version that redacts the offensive bits... and makes it unplayable, but at least you still have a "book."<br><br>I think the real thing to be aware of and, maybe even, to take to our "Representatives" is this:<br>(a) the "retconning" of a trade - I agree that it should have been between the estate holder and the pirates, with Amazon maybe co-sued for trafficking in stolen goods, for lack of due diligence. But stripping someone of a trade, without even telling them? And you haven't answered my "what happens if the refunds bork?" A bunch of consumers get to go sue Amazon for $10 each?<br><br>(b) the maintenance of buying habit records, to even give Amazon the means to find the sales THEY made illegally - I'm sure it's all legit in some eighty-page EULA that no one read before clicking I Accept. Yep, our lazy ass faults... but, hang on, isn't our country trying to get lending contracts to be more clear and transparent, without a bunch of verbiage that confuses or make glassy-eyes? Now, isn't that basically in the same spirit of the question here: Amazon can legally say, "You impatient, illiterate nimrods agreed to this practice, here on Line 336, paragraph 24, Section 9 of the EULA;" but is it *right*?<br><br>(c) the ability to do such a thing without bothering to inform someone - You apparently don't own your Kindle; you've leased it for a fixed rate and indefinite term. And you're tracked, at both the point of sale AND when on any Internet-attached network. And you might never find out WHAT they take from (or push to!) you, once your collection is so huge you can't notice at a glance that something you've kept is gone.<br/><br/>If that doesn't bother you, as a consumer and a publisher, then... okie doke, I guess. I hope I at least answered your "why is there an uproar" question for the many of us that it does bother.<br/><br/>if nothing else comes of this... I surely won't be offering my book(s) through Amazon, in Kindle format.

On some level, you WANT your Kindle to be a book, to be a seamless and awesome replacement for carrying a suitcase full of paperbacks with you.  But when something comes along to break that illusion -- a stark reminder that, no, Amazon can take away those files whenever it wants, because these files are not actually books -- the illusion of the Kindle as "just like a book, only better" is broken.  And to many people, myself included, that doesn't seem <i>right</i>.

I can know that to really own a book I need a hardcopy, but at the same time wish that the copy on my Kindle was ALSO mine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley" title="Jack Aidley"><img alt="Jack Aidley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley">Jack Aidley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219924/#Comment_219924" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T15:12:56+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  3:12PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2009 3:13PM by Jack Aidley.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder whether anyone will challenge the legality of this in the courts.

The author will be a strictly work-for-hire indentured contractor and will likely end up owing the publisher tens of thousands of dollars just for the privilege of writing the book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219952/#Comment_219952" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T16:31:34+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  4:31PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD, yup.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would not at all be surprised to see that be the direction it goes inside of our lifetimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd its a trend that makes complete sense really.  Back in the industrial age we valued things.  Tangible things you can hold in your hand.  We made things and we sold things and we owned things.<br/>\n<br/>\nBooks were a thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday...we don't make things.  We offer services, and we create Intellectual Property.  Things are old fashioned.  Nobody cares about Things.  We care about ideas and activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you pay for a service you get to use that service...for as long as you pay for it.  When you stop paying you stop getting access to the service.  When you pay to have your hair cut you pay for that one instance of getting your hair cut.  You don't pay for the right to have your hair perpetually short.  If you stop paying your accountant to do your taxes the accountant stops doing your taxes.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaying for services is a fundamentally different thing than paying for things.  When you pay for a thing you expect to own it forever.  When you pay for a service you own it for the duration of that service.  When that service includes IP you have a whole different hook.  The service you are paying for is no longer an activity like cutting your hair or doing your taxes.  The service you are paying for is access to the IP.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has been the direction the western world has been moving in since we transitioned to a service based economy in the 70s and 80s.  The web / internet has simply created the technology that makes it possible to turn access into a controllable service.<br/>\n<br/>\nEVERYTHING has been moving in this direction for some time now.  Businesses are all motivated to figure out a way to turn selling you a product into selling you a service.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you pay for your car in cash you've bought a thing.  When you finance your car you've bought a service.  Same with your house.  They might pretend that you "own" your house.  But if you have a mortgage all you really own is the right to have your debt payments serviced for you.  And if you think that paying off your mortgage means you actually own your house...try not paying your property tax and see what you really own.  What you own, is the right to live in your house...as long as you pay your taxes...and how is that different from a subscription fee or membership dues, really?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you belong to a home owners association, or a condo association then you have restrictions on you.  And even if you don't you probably live in an area with Zoning laws and municipal Code Enforcement workers who can tresspass on your property and fine you if they don't like how long your grass is or how much your paint is peeling.  EULA's are nothing more than businesses attempting to make everything like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yeah, this is the natural extension of moving from a thing based manufacturing society to an idea based service society.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a thing society what you are buying is a book.  A physical object.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn an idea society what you are buying is access to the author's words.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a thing society when you give a book to someone else nothing is lost.  Before there was 1 thing, now there is 1 thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn an idea society when you give access to the author's words to someone else, something is lost.  Somebody got access to those words for free.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe logical culmination of living in an idea society is that letting someone else read your book equals stealing access to the author's words.  You paid for the right to read those words...they didn't.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe logical culmination of living in an idea society is that all access to things will be converted into services.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will not have a car.  You will have access to a service which provides transportation.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will not have a house.  You will have access to a service which provides living space.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will not have a pantry full of food.  You will have access to a service which provides meals<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will not have a book.  You will have access to a service that lets you read words.<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually, everything will work like your phone and utilities.  Make your monthly service payment or have your power turned off.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why I find outrage over Kindle to be laughable.  The same people who get outraged over the idea that Amazon can delete a book from their Kindle are perfectly happy letting their Home Owner's Association tell them what color to paint their house, letting their bank tell them what level of insurance coverage they need, and letting Code Enforcement tell them when they have to mow their lawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose things have been going on for decades largely uncommented on except by a few fringe libertarian-types... but THIS...THIS is what people get all up in arms about...absurd.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219978/#Comment_219978" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-21T18:22:36+00:00" title="July 21, 2009  6:22PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2009 6:27PM by johnzo.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>In the current case it was a violation of existing law that there was a reasonable expectation on Amazon to abide by.

And yes, by my sketchy understanding of such things, countries with Western legal traditions aren't supposed to apply laws ex post facto, unless, of course, they are being lobbied by powerful telecommunications companies.<br><br>But I believe that the law is mostly irrelevant as a restraint on either Amazon or lawmakers.  The law is slow, ponderous, expensive, and corrupt, and code trumps it anyway.  The Napster code that enabled tens  of millions of people to pirate music is much more powerful than the laws that enabled civil lawsuits against a paltry few hundred accused pirates.  The former changed the world; the latter did not chance Internet user behavior significantly.  It just made life suck for those who were caught.  <br><br>Amazon has code that allows them to alter the contents of your Kindle.*  Amazon is free to use their remote access power whenever a cost-benefit analysis suggests that they ought to.  And actually, whether they were legally or morally correct in the 1984 case is actually irrelevant to me.  The technical capabilities they've demonstrated are distasteful enough that I don't mind spending time explaining their pitfalls -- especially on a site where some of my favorite publishers hang out.  And I am happy that they have demonstrated their capabilities and spurred this discussion, because the marketplace is the most powerful restraint on Kindle.<br><br>* It's also entirely possible that Amazon has the power to remotely and silently examine the contents of your Kindle -- and not because they're evil people who want to out all their customers to the local secret police, but because they're a research-driven company and their secret sauce is the enormous amount of effort they direct towards studying their users' habits.  ( You can trust me on this.  I am in a position to know Amazon's methodologies.  Their leadership position is not undeserved. )  This potential capability is even more troubling to me, but I'll stop there because I'm sure someone's just gonna play the paranoid slippery-slope card if I go further.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>The logical culmination of living in an idea society is that all access to things will be converted into services.</blockquote>\nThe prerecorded music industry appears not to be honoring this inevitability.

A particular model was tried.  And I wouldn't even say it failed given that it worked for a number of years.  The big hurdle with the original I-tunes model is that its hard to turn content into a service when the hardware is not controlled.  It worked for Apple when the IPod was the clearly superior hardware but as competitors developed as good or superior hardware that couldn't be controlled it became more difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the next big paradigm attempt will be with so called Cloud Computing.  It may not be the IP owners that wind up being the controlling service providers.  It may be when they stop selling computers and devices with hard drives and built in memory.  When all of your software and databases are housed out there in server land and your personal computing devices are just "dumb terminals" accessing it.  It may not be the music providers you are paying a service fee to, it may be the data storage providers you're paying a service fee to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be lots of different attempts.  Look at cell phones for an alternative example.  As long as you have a service contract with the provider you can upgrade / replace your phone every two years.  The capabilities of smart phones expand such that you generally WANT to upgrade your phone every two years.  At that point do you really own your phone...or are you essentially just leasing it with the service agreement.  Or imagine a 50" LCD TV where the TV is almost free...but the bulb life is only 1 year and the cost of the bulb is almost the same as the cost of the TV, but you can buy an "extended warranty plan" for only $X per year and the bulb will be replaced free.  At that point do you really own the TV...or do you really own a service contract.<br/>\n<br/>\nHard to say what methods will stick.  Once they do away with actual currency it will be that much easier.  The price of downloading an MP3 will simply be $0.01 per week deducted from your centralized credit account for the rest of your life.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, as someone who believes (along with Sam Adams) that the ownership of and disposition over personal property is one of our inalienable rights I find the whole situation pretty much a fundamental assault on the very nature of Liberty.  Which is why I'm pretty much convinced that its inevitable.  Because the powers that be have a high degree of motivation to strip us of our personal liberties and make us more and more dependent on the "system".

And what's reasonable to expect from a purchase, a <i>sale</i>, is that you own something. If you don't own it it's not a sale, it's a rental. Everyone understands that, because people who offer rentals make it crystal clear that it's not a sale. <i>So if "sellers" of electronic media wish to sell that media as "access services" instead of actual goods, they have to make it crystal clear to all and sundry that that's what they're doing.</i> A dense EULA is not crystal clear.

The hypothetical still holds: does my presumed-legal purchase of PD <i>1984</i> become illegal when I enter the US, giving Amazon US the right to do the deletion and refund?<br>...<br>Hell, I suppose so, if looked at in one way. I can legally buy some pot in Uganda (let's presume) and, sure enough, if I take it into the US I am breaking the law. So copyright law is, ultimately, a law about POSSESSION, not about purchase or sale, in this parallel with pot. (And, for at a time, in Oregon, I could have had my Ugandan pot with me because possession wasn't illegal, just sale and purchase--the "Miracle Ounce" defense that was so popular there at the time: "I found it, your Honor.")<br><br>Since this thread started, there's more uproar, too. And I really, REALLY don't think the issue comes down to not knowing the EULA, teh good v. service paradigm shift, or even copyright violation and who's responsible (the middle man, the pirate) and who should pay (the ignorant consumers via refunds, the pirates via law suit). I think the issue is, simply, OMFG, they can DO that?! But, but... where does it all END?!? *begin picking through the EULA with a fine tooth comb; dismiss Amazon as a worthwhile source and the Kindle as a attractive device*<br><br>And... hehe. I mean, it's fucking <i>1984</i>! Does ANYONE in Amazon's legal department have a sense of irony? Does anyone in their marketing department understand the notions of public perception and trust (and, more so, how they are central themes of the novel)?<br><br>(And, yeah, for me it's a bit of a "fuck you" to the estate holders, for owning a property--no, wait, TWO properties--that are required reading in most middle schools in America. Apparently, anything written by an author who died later than 1938 is, de facto, a financial drain on either parents or the education system, if it is to be a subject of study.

As a practical matter, I've read more books than I otherwise would have. I estimate 50% more. One of my favorite features is little commented on: the on-board OED. I just highlight a word and get a fully entry on it. I've always looked up words as I'm reading, but it's so seemless now, it's just a joy. As for the 1984 kerfuffle, I'll say it's unfortunate, but that's as far as I'm going. Nerdrage, not for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220587/#Comment_220587" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-24T09:19:43+00:00" title="July 24, 2009  9:19AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is very, very topical:<br><br>Jonathan Zittrain, a guy who chairs at Harvard / Oxford on things like internet law, has some interesting stuff to say about "generative", "sterile", and "tethered" devices.
