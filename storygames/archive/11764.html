We've already got <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11746" rel="nofollow">a religious discussion going on</a> (which I've declined to join), but I thought it might be worthwhile to explore the other half of the equation.<br/><br/>I'll go first.<br/><br/>Believe it or not, I'm actually something of a lefty, though my midlife crisis has got me longing somewhat for the politics of my youth.  I came of age during the '80s when Reaganism was in full force and I bought into that particular mode of thinking, especially as it related to foreign affairs, without question.  To put it another way: I was a huge fan of G. Gordon Liddy.  Okay?  I'm not proud of it, but at my beliefs in those days were at least easy to parse.<br/><br/>My the time the '90s rolled around I'd begun to realize that right-wing politics weren't doing much good for folks domestically and I turned further and further toward the left-hand side of the spectrum.  These days I'm a Medicare-for-all, tax the rich 'til they squeal, marriage for gays, end the wars kind of left-winger, though I've never really lost my disdain for bleeding heart types who take mortal offense at everything.  That kind of neo-hippy thing just sticks in my craw.<br/><br/>How does all of this affect my gaming?  Quite a lot, actually.  As I've <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11625" rel="nofollow">stated elsewhere</a>, my gaming during the Reagan era was profoundly informed by anti-Communism and my <i>Top Secret</i> and <i>Top Secret S/I</i> games were littered with the bodies of dead Russians and their allies.  We played this way without an ounce of irony.<br/><br/>As things changed for me politically I started to inject a note of commentary into this sort of play.  We might still be taking on the roles of proto-fascist bullies behaving in reprehensible ways \u2014 hi, fellow players of Coalition soldiers in <i>Rifts</i> \u2014 but now we were doing it with an eye toward pointing up the excesses and general inhumanity behind such philosophies.  I also found I couldn't really play something like a South African mercenary with the same zeal as I might have in the '80s because the anti-Communist cushion for <i>apartheid</i> had been removed and the darker implications of such a character could no longer be downplayed.  Different times, folks.  Different times.<br/><br/>These days I'm of two minds about the political content of my gaming.  On the one hand, I wish for the political simplicity of my youth: there are the Commies, go get 'em.  On the other hand, I know better now about how geopolitics work absent that right-wing filter and I want to bring real-world complexity to the games I run.  I once asked Daniel Levine to address how he might, for example, run something like <a href="http://www.holistic-design.com/RLR/RLRbooks.htm#Somal" rel="nofollow">Somalia d20</a> because that's a perfect example of a tangled political and cultural situation that can't be boiled down to left-wing or right-wing talking points.  Or at least not honestly.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's probably quite enough from me.  I'm primarily interested in what the rest of you have to say.  So... what say you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262757/#Comment_262757" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T10:58:00+00:00" title="March 18, 2010 10:58AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2010 10:58AM by Robert_Bohl.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I said on the spirituality thread, I'm an atheist, skeptic, liberal, secular humanist.

Secular humanism is very much both political and spiritual to me; my original reason for abandoning Christianity as a teenager was strictly ethical and had nothing to do with the mythology - it just wasn't right, no matter whether true or not, and Christ would be welcome to punish me in the afterlife all he wants. Now, if we understand politics as the practical strategy of ethics, one might question whether liberalism really is the road to ethical good. The simple answer is that with all things being equal, at least the wrong choices made by people on their own account are theirs to account for - do not ask me to rule over others, as that would be too much of a moral responsibility for any one man.<br/><br/>I don't think that my politics influence the content of my games in any particular bipartisan way, though; I have plenty of political and philosophical content in my play and design, but it's not advocacy so much as opportunities for these things to be discussed. I suppose you could interpret this very attitude as political in itself, if we consider liberalism to include the idea that free evaluation of ideas is the road to truth and justice. So if I try to make my gaming table a free speech zone and a safe platform for even opinions I don't espouse, perhaps that's not so much apolitical as liberal?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262808/#Comment_262808" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T13:13:53+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  1:13PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am politically agnostic.

It's not front-and-center in any of my games, but it'll most likely shape some of the background, and I'm starting to think it would be a good idea if I started being more conscious of how my personal opinions are coloring what I bring into a game.<br/><br/>For example, I don't typically make authoritarian governments or organizations sympathetic; if there are good people working within those organizations, they are constantly struggling to do good things, often in spite of the organization they work for.  There's definitely a tendency to emphasize this in all organizations, I guess -- individuals always tend to be at odds with the groups they belong to, and to be dissatisfied with at least one thing that their group is involved in, creating conflict and moral dilemmas.<br/><br/>I tend to assume that things which increase personal liberty and privacy are good, or at the very least better than the alternatives.  If there's a decision between supporting individual rights and sacrificing those rights to gain something else (increased security or whatever), I generally don't do a good job of making those options seem equally valid.  I feel like I consistently make the sacrifice of personal rights something that will screw you over in the long run.<br/><br/>I tend to show large corporations and hardline capitalists as being unsympathetic to people and antagonistic to a livable society; if groups like that show up in my game, odds are that the only reason they aren't making the world a worse place to live is because someone or something is forcing them to "play nice."  There's an underlying assumption that, say, the only reason food companies don't all ship salmonella-laced peanut butter to schools and nursing homes is because they are required to test for salmonella and there are federal officers who will come down on them like a ton of bricks if they sell contaminated products.  (And even then, they'll <i>still try to get away with selling it.</i>)  Genuinely ethical, responsible businesses are usually exceptional in some way, and are threatened by hordes of less scrupulous competitors.<br/><br/>I don't make censors, zealots, or strongly intolerant groups (for either conservative or liberal causes) out to be good guys.  At best, they might be well-intentioned adversaries or the Loyal Opposition; at worst, they are villains.<br/><br/><br/>Now, I'm not sure how much I actually want to try to change these tendencies, but just typing this out has gotten me thinking about it, and I feel like being aware of this is going to be hugely beneficial.

Even the most monolithic-seeming authoritarian government ends up faction-riven and arbitrary, the result of a delicate balancing act between the various power center that actually allow Dear Leader to remain in power (even in Nazi Germany, after all, the party had to be concerned with keeping the army, the state bureaucracy, the judiciary, and the big industrial concerns on side). This allows for possibly more interesting interactions with such governments/organizations; if you know how to game them or who to play off against who, life becomes much more livable.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I tend to apply public choice theory in determining how people in positions of power act. That is, there is a certain set of rational incentives that they have by virtue of how they become and remain officeholders, and they will tend to act in that way, regardless of whatever rhetoric they dress up their choices in to convince others/themselves. There is scope for getting this wrong, but in the aggregate actors in institutions will follow those incentives, whether or not this is a good idea for the institution/its constituents.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, imperfect information means that decision-makers often get things hilariously wrong, and have a much more limited ability to impact the world in a constructive way than they would like to believe. This also leads into monitoring problems - how exactly do the people at the top check up on what their underlings are doing? - that complicate life considerably. This is obviously less of a concern in settings with magic that can control or observe people flawlessly, but I tend not to play in such settings.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately, this means that institutions in my games are a species of blind hydra, many-intentioned, many-armed, often flailing, and usually responding to external events in ways that seem bizarrely disproportionate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263010/#Comment_263010" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-19T13:18:00+00:00" title="March 19, 2010  1:18PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My politcs are best described as "aging punk".<br/><br/>Revolutionary themes are common in my games, especially the tendency for money and power to fuck things up once the rebels win and become the new establishment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
