The PCs infiltrated a base that was one mile under the ground of Volturns. They shot a lot of guys. They grabbed some credits, guns and a super microchip.<br/><br/>All of the players were equipped with Exoskeletons, even the Dralasite IIRC. Basically in SF, exoskeletons can turn you into NEO, and they don't cost all that much.<br/><br/>One of the enemies once the doors opened at the bottom of the elevator shaft was "a group of 6 mercenaries that fought like ballerinas, with sonic swords on their feet". They would pirouette around the players, slashing them the fuck up with their toes.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113387/#Comment_113387" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-10T14:13:23+00:00" title="December 10, 2007  2:13PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2007 2:13PM by John_Harper.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

The last time I ran Paranoia, there was an Unplanned Massive Explosive Incident within the initial mission briefing.  The entire troubleshooter squad was killed, as was the mission briefing officer.  When the new clones arrived, the MBO ordered everyone to sit, in spite of the fact that the chairs had already been destroyed.  One character sat on his previous clone's head.<br/><br/>If you haven't had anyone die before the briefing is over, you are a weak and lenient Computer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113584/#Comment_113584" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-11T11:25:15+00:00" title="December 11, 2007 11:25AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last time I played Paranoia, a clone was launched via rocket to assist us immediately after his previous iteration's death.
