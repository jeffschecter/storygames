inspired me to make a CafePress shop:<br/><a href="http://www.cafepress.com/davidartmandesigns" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.cafepress.com/davidartmandesigns</a><br/><br/>Specifically:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://images.cpcache.com/image/44049853_400x400.png"/><br/><br/>That got me thinking--what sorts of geeky, gamer QR Code "surprises/Easter eggs" could this pack of geniuses come up with?<br/><br/>I thought of some kind of Freemarket promotion, but I can't do anything with that at CP (durned copyright).<br/><br/>I ALSO thought it would be super-sweet (and technologically a CHALLENGE) to make a QR Code that was a discernible image AND contained some kind of information when scanned--does anyone have any ideas about that, other than brute-force entering text and seeing if an "pixel art" image emerges (or vice versa: making a pixel art image and hoping it scans)?<br/><br/>Finally, I thought of having a game's (or its creator's) contact info or download/Lulu page on a shirt, and when someone asks, "Where can I get it?" you reply, "Scan me!"<br/><br/>This is the best site I found for QR Code generating:<br/><a href="http://keremerkan.net/qr-code-and-2d-code-generator/"

Then one extracts with the same program and key, right? (My uncle is a paranoid, and tries to get me to send stuff like that if it's in ANY way dodgy!) And that's supposed to be extra-hard to decrypt with JPG attack, because you have to find bit-encoded data, not words (i.e. ASCII), in the "front" image.<br/><br/>I'm talking more about having a final, viewable piece of art--like a black-on-white Mario icon or a company logo--which in turn can be scanned as a QR (or other bit-mapped) Code. I spent... oh, more time than I should have... putting various phrases into a generator, to see if it would spit out anything approaching a recognizable graphic, with no luck. Which made me wonder if some kind of program could try to "converge" a pixel-art image with English words, to eventually get a phrase out of it (or, again, vice versa).<br/><br/>But really I'm more into cool promotional ideas that can leverage this new (to me) pocket technology.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

It would also be good for something like a <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17/button-men" rel="nofollow">Buttonmen</a> tournament.  <br/><br/>What about using it to do promotional codes.

Anyhow, so I'm sitting here watching <i>The Warriors</i> and an idea slips into the back of my brain - running a warriors-like game at a convention.  <br/><br/>The requirement to join is that you have at least 5-9  people to a team and that you all have some identifiable marker (e.g. paper hats, armbands, white shirts, etc. that people brought 9 of).  Once you get to the con, you form up and register.  When you register you get a sticker with a QR code that you put on the back of your badge and the leader gets a stack of business cards. There are two big events in the game.  The first is the rally where all the groups meet up to start the game. Thereacter, whenever two groups pass each other, they face off.  During a face off, the winner is determined by scanning and comparing QR codes.  The mechanic would have to be something like blind bidding, high/low, or Stratego.  Whoever wins has to give a business card to the other group.  At certain points in the con, you would have someone on the PA announce a number of cards and any group with fewer than that number of cards has to ditch their identifier.  As the numbers being announced increase over time, there are fewer groups and they stick out more.  In the end, there can be only... two.  The second event is the last two groups in a winner take all showdown.  The winning group gets some cool identifier as a prize that they can start with the next year.  <br/><br/>Anyhow, just an idea...<br/><br/>[edit] You could also combine this with a scavenger hunt where each group had a piece of the puzzle and you get their clue if you defeat them.  The first team to decode enough info to figure out who killed [insert gaming celebrity MC here] wins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292493/#Comment_292493" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T08:21:24+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  8:21AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good idea, and a con game always goes over well.

Thus the web site solution (scan, get link, allow scan app to follow link, browser opens and generates PC, PC displayed in browser, to be saved as a bookmark or downloaded or whatever).<br/>-----<br/>Another LARP idea off that, though--as part of the Experience system for a module, each PC scans a QR Code which provides them with a unique line of text or string.

If a PC took long enough, he or she could find them all and get all three strings. Unfortunately, the room is filling with "a deadly gas" or there's a neigh-unkillable monster shuffling up the hallway to eat everyone.

I had in mind a system where each group gets the words 1 through 9 in QR code, starting at 9 and going down one for each group member.  When groups fight, one member of the larger group pairs with each member of the smaller team.  Each pair would then scan both badges and the person with the higher number scores one point for their group.  The group with the most points gets a card from the other group.  ...or something like that.  <br/><br/>Honestly, I'm having a hard time coming up with a system where the use of QR codes enhances the game rather than just being a gimmick.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>That might be a GREAT way to do something like "Library Use," too.

You could even provide websites with random generators so that a sidebar with potential story hooks could be scanned to take you to a web page that displays a random story hook (also good for culture specific random name generator, e.g. a game about native Americans could link to a Cherokee name randomizer).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292836/#Comment_292836" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-10T10:40:23+00:00" title="September 10, 2010 10:40AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool idea about using them in books for additional content.
