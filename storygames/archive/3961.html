It's unfortunate that the booth was "hidden around the corner". If at all possible, I think the Ashcan Front would ideally be across from the FORGE booth. Ashcans could easily benefit from heavy FORGE traffic and everyone could point across the way, "See those games? They inspired all of these!" and "See those games?

I sat in on a demo and played a troll with a battleaxe trying to rescue J.P. Morgan's daugther from some kidnappers in upstate New York. The game itself is pretty traditional. I don't know what kind of numbers he did, but if it sold well, it's because: (1) Great cover, (2) great hook, and (3) Justin is like a demo energizer bunny (second only to Leonard?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88879/#Comment_88879" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-20T08:16:24+00:00" title="August 20, 2007  8:16AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know that one of my friends who was down at Gen Con picked up a copy of Fae Noir, when she normally isn't a big buyer, because she said the demo games were the most fun she'd had in ages.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Flynn" title="Flynn"><img alt="Flynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Flynn">Flynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88912/#Comment_88912" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-20T11:45:16+00:00" title="August 20, 2007 11:45AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: zacharythefirst</cite>The small press game I saw being carried around the most was far and away was Rogue Games'<i>Colonial Gothic</i>.</blockquote>\nI was excited about this game.  But Rogue Games really fell on their face regarding the registered demo games for this rpg.  I bought tickets for the Thursday session, two friends had tickets for a Friday session, and someone I talked to had tickets for the Saturday game.  In every case, the GM failed to show up.  I understand that there was room confusion (tickets printed with wrong rooms, GenCon guide book wrong, etc) but we checked the live errata at the con.  Heck, my friends even went to the Rogue Games booth and told them about the issue and they still hadn't sorted it out by the following day.<br/><br/>This game seemed like a sure sale to me - if I had had a moderately positive game experience, they would have had a sale (probably four of them if you include my friends and the other guy).  But their total failure on this issue has left us all turned off on this game, even if it later turns out to be cool.<br/><br/>Did anyone play a demo of "Colonial Gothic" that wasn't at the booth itself?  Can anyone comment on the game in more detail?

But here we go:<br/><br/>1. <b>Poison'd</b>. Vincent's pirate game is not just white-hot design, it also facilitated one of the best gaming sessions of my life. This game is <i>important</i> to me, above and beyond its contents.<br/><br/>2. <b>Steal Away Jordan</b>. Everyone talks about the power of this book's premise and presentation (as well they should), but Julia's game also has clever and compelling mechanics, too.<br/><br/>3. <b>Psi Run</b>. This game is designed to be read, learned, and played (even with game noobs) all in one session. I think it actually achieves this goal. The final game product (it's in ashcan now) will be an important addition to the hobby. I hope the final form is a beautiful and inspirational <i>object</i> as well as a sharp text.<br/><br/>4. <b>Galactic</b>. Matt's game has grown up from a precocious teen into a thoughtful adult. The game is firing on all cylinders now, and only lacks some playtesting to refine some budget and resource numbers (which all you ashcan purchasers will no doubt accomplish). Each game of this, for me, has been more fun than the last.<br/><br/>5. <b>Bliss Stage</b>. This was a shocker for me, in a way. I expected Ben's game to be hot, but I didn't expect it to grab me (I'm not really into anime, giant robots, or teen angst -- unless Buffy is involved). But I was so wrong. The game just gets a hold on you with its grabby, grabby system. I only played a demo, but it was powerful and fun. I snatched up the book immediately after. And I just found out last night that one of my players is a huge anime/giant robot fan, so there's a good chance of this one going into the rotation.<br/><br/>Five is not enough! I also got <b>44</b>, <b>Sign in Stranger</b>, <b>Roanoke</b>, <b>Full Light Full Steam</b>, <b>Shock 1.1</b>, <b>Dirty Secrets</b>, <b>Know Thyself</b>, <b>Acts of Evil</b>, <b>Blossoms are Falling</b>, and <b>Giants</b>.<br/><br/>And I <i>totally forgot</i> to grab <b>Sweet Agatha</b> and <b>The Roach Returns</b>.

I'd also be pretty shocked if Fae Noir didn't sell a ton. I know very little about the game, but it seemed to attract a lot of so called "traditional gamers" (I hate the term, because it sounds dismissive). Also, Fae Noir had the first indie games booth babe, and I can only assume that generated a lot of...ahem...interest.</blockquote>\nI don't have final numbers from Brennan, but I believe Fae Noir sold somewhere between 30 and 45 books total. Don't know if that counts as "a ton." I'm pretty excited about selling that many with basically zero buzz/marketing of the game prior to the convention. <br/>I think we definitely got a fair amount of sales from "traditional gamers" and I'm still trying to analyze the sales pattern. In general, I think we sold about twice as many books on Sunday as on any of the previous days (which seemed to have a flat sales pattern). This may have been due to word getting out around the convention and people coming to check out Fae Noir. <br/>That said, I know for sure that, in addition to the games Brennan has mentioned, that Dirty Secrets sold a metric buttload. And having heard SOTC's lifetime numbers, I'd be surprised if any game could compete with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89197/#Comment_89197" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T13:10:12+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  1:10PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I came to GenCon with a list of games to buy, being already sold on them for one reason or another.

Instead, I dropped the cash on <i>Hero's Banner</i>.  I may play it vanilla, or I may hack it to some other setting.

I was working under the assumption that Robin D. Law's generic HeroQuest rewrite was the only HQ related product to look forward to. But OtherWorlds (formerly QuestWolds) promises to be an awesome game, and in many ways I'm not looking more forward to it than I am to the HQ revision.<br/><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">5.

They're good games, but they've had a year of sales already so it surprised me they were that strong.<br/><br/>My upper, optimistic guess for Best Friends was 20 and I beat that easily.<br/><br/>Eric Boyd's game, Committee For The Exploration Of Mysteries, did over 20 and I think more people are going to pick up that book in the after-con flurry of sales. I had a blast playing in the demo and picked it up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number%20Ten%20Ox" title="Number Ten Ox"><img alt="Number Ten Ox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number%20Ten%20Ox">Number Ten Ox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89242/#Comment_89242" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T15:26:52+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  3:26PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My top five:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.

I was very happy with the strength of the demo, especially when I was able to see people coming around from "Oh, demoes are boring" to "Wow, I'm actually having a lot of fun."  That's the stuff that makes me happy to be a game designer.<br/><br/>My favorite demoes, though, have to be Steal Away Jordan and Bliss Stage for entirely different reasons.  Steal Away Jordan honestly made me a bit emotional in just one scene.  In a way I was glad when it ended, but at the same time I knew that the game was demanding more play from me.<br/><br/>Bliss Stage just hit me out of nowhere.  I sort of deliberately avoided learning about the game until GenCon, and I'm glad I did.  When Ben explained that my character's mech was literally composed of his various relationships -- girlfriends, best buds, whatever -- my jaw hit the table and it took a while for the gears to start turning again.<br/><br/>Of course this isn't to say that I didn't have a blast playing in a bunch of other games from new ones like The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries to older ones like Universalis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89296/#Comment_89296" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T19:17:50+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  7:17PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim C Koppang</cite>Steal Away Jordan honestly made me a bit emotional in just one scene.</blockquote>\nMe, too.

My top five:<br/><br/>1. Dirty Secrets - Seth had a clever demo and I'm a sucker for the genre, which he has captured in an awesome fashion.<br/>2. Steal Away Jordan - I got to demo this one twice, and Julia did a great job showing both the great mechanics and emotional power of the game. My almost exclusively White Wolf playing buddy bought <i>two</i> copies - it's that good.<br/>3. Grey Ranks - I'd rank it higher but I only got to watch part of a demo, not play in one. That said, Polish sons leaving their mothers behind to fight a hopeless battle never looked so good.<br/>4. Dragons of Kir - An indie board game that Andy K brought to the Embassy Suites one night. A bunch of us played and ended up buying our own copies soon afterward.<br/>5. The Ashcan Front - A heaping helping of awesome to be had. I was tempted to buy them all, but realized that this wasn't really the purpose. So I limited myself to Galactic, 44, Psi Run, and Sweet Agatha. I'll be ready to buy the final versions of many more, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

This excites me more than is probably healthy.<br/>2) Poison'd. I know that this will delight and horrify not only my regular gamer group, but many of the non-gamer improvisers that I will drag kicking and screaming on board.<br/>3) Shock: v1.1.

Took me totally by surprise - this pushes all the buttons of my gamer buddies.<br/>5) Grey Ranks. Originally a hard sell, but I saw eyes widening and people shifting in their chairs as I described it to folks tonight. It will hit the table soon.<br/><br/>Also on the short list are Giants, Acts of Evil, Steal Away Jordan, Shooting The Moon, Contenders, and Galactic, among others.
