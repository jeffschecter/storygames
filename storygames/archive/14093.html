(I haven't seen it.)</blockquote>\nInteresting question. i didn't like the movie, but i *know* what's cool: the fight scenes are incredibly over-the-top (hong kong action meets final fantasy meets Dungeons: The Dragoning, and they all merge into a howling, composite super-robot), and cycle through all the settings and baddies you can actually dream of (steam-powered zombie nazis, zeppelins, dragons, giant robotic samurais, orks, cyborgs), and the home team is composed of absolutely gorgeous girls.

Whenever I see a movie like this, I think, "What can learn from this and bring into my games?" and sadly, don't think <i>Sucker Punch</i> provided anything new, or even new combinations of old ideas.<br/><br/>"But the action scenes!" shouts the fanboy. Yes, they were entertaining and well done, but were the novel? I already thought undead steam Nazis, mechs, train heists, and giant samurai were cool. (For that last one in particular: take a look at <i>Brazil</i>.) Mission-based play is a no-brainer for this crowd. And at this point, I think it's more original when the zeppelins <i>don't</i> blow up.<br/><br/>"But all the levels of reality!" yells the other fanboy (dressed like a hipster). Again, interesting, but not new. There's no need to name a bunch of other films here that do this better; it suffices to say I wanted <i>Sucker Punch</i> to go deeper. The "playable metaphors" Tristan mentioned above were a valiant attempt to go in a new direction, but even that wasn't particularly innovative if we look a little further afield. I already understood the appeal of metaphoric battles from <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> (the comics, not so much the movie), and the connections between the levels in <i>Sucker Punch</i> were just too heavy-handed: "Oh, Babydoll is swaying again. I guess it's time for an action scene."<br/><br/>I think there's a good movie somewhere in <i>Sucker Punch</i>, but drawing it out would have required some very different choices along the way. The biggest of these would have been to expect more of the audience; if the film had traded the slo-mo intro for occasional flashbacks, thrown us into the action, and woven the levels of reality together without making it so obvious how they related, it could have been a much more rewarding experience.<br/><br/><i>Edit: </i>Oh, and as for what system: <b>Wushu</b> for the action world, <b>A Dirty World</b> (ORE) for the brothel, and <b>GURPS</b> (or something equally depressing) for the asylum, combined via John Wick's <b>The Flux</b>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319315/#Comment_319315" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-07T07:00:47+00:00" title="April  7, 2011  7:00AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2011 7:05AM by Teataine.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lemme get back to my own thread.<br/><br/>A) Here's the thing: I think Sucker Punch is a pretty bad movie. But I don't think for any of the reasons listed in this thread. And I loved it.<br/><br/>Not even in an ironic "so bad it's good" way, that's completely different. The reason why I love it is buried in this thread.<br/><br/>Show me another movie that compells people to say it's a) trying to be masturbatory but failing, b) masturbatory material, c) influenced by anti-masturbatory theory? That's so many contradictions at once I don't even have enough fingers to count them on.<br/><br/>I went to rottentomatoes and saw the word "erotic" pasted over a lot of the reviews and it made me laugh. I don't know how anyone could watch this movie the whole way through and call it "erotic". I also think the movie is a lot smarter that a lot of reviewers are willing to admit or managed to notice*. But it's also not nearly smart enough to redeem itself fully. (*I need to constantly remind myself I live in a world where people needed charts and diagrams to understand Inception.)<br/><br/>Bottom line: The movie has two opposing agendas that constantly invalidate and undermine one another and yet manages to keep them in line until the very last frame of the movie. And that's why I love it.<br/><br/>To put it differently: as Nathan said, it's kinda like watching a bunch of 13 year olds play a game after they've read Andrea Dworking. You cannot but feel a certain patronizing contempt for them. But they're 13 year olds <i>who've read Andrea Dworkin</i>. And you cannot but feel a certain pride at that. (Let's forget for a moment that Zack is not actually 13 years old). I sat through the whole movie with a smirk on my face that I myself was not sure was expressing amused mockery or reserved glee. It's an endlessly contradicting picture.<br/><br/>It is tempting to say it's possibly the first completely postmodern movie I've seen. Not at all in its philistine plundering and collaging of music and imagery, but in its complete pluralism of meaning - not in the traditional sense that it leaves room for interpretation (lots of movies do) but in the way it interprets itself against itself.<br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> The game suggestions are interesting, because they show how differently we watched the movie. Frex, I would have never thought of BESM, because I never saw the anime connection (beyond a fleeting nod in the samurai sequence). I certainly didn't expect or find it to be relevant to the movie at all.<br/>I find Ultraviolet fails because the protagonists of Sucker Punch are definitely not invincible. In fact they all die.<br/>I also think GURPS is exactly wrong for the asylum. There's absolutely nothing there that would have been in any way supported or enhanced by GURPS' extensive skill lists or its "gritty realistic simulation" resolution. That whole bit of the movie was really a big conflict resolution exchange.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Oh, and an absolutely pointless nitpick: those weren't nazis.

I loved the first music video - er, fight scene, I was really wowed by it. But then as it become obvious that each subsequent fight scene was not in any way connected to the story, I started to find them boring. And when a film can make a fight between steam-powered WW1 german zombies and mechas boring, it's failed on a truly amazing level. If I hadn't been trapped in the cinema (miles from home, relying on someone else for a lift), I'd have walked out bored. As it is, I watched it hoping there'd be something to salvage from it, but increasingly, it becaome obvious that the film thought it was much clever than it actually was. The fight scenes were introduced with obvious video-game style objectives, so ridiculous that you'd laugh if you experienced them in an actual video game, and the voice-over narration revealing insight into humanity, bla bla, was incredibly cringeworthy, worthy only for writing on the most schmaltzy hallmark cards.<br/><br/>Regarding the supposed female empowerment. This was a film in which a girl was imprisonon in an asylum, and to escape from it, imagined herself imprisoned in a whorehouse where she danced for men. Then, to escape the actual sex, she imagined herself fighting bizarre video game battles. Female empowerment? I don't think so.<br/><br/>No, I was not a fan, and the things it tries to do have been done much better elsewhere - except for the action scenes. I'd love to see a film that took those action scenes, and made a film where they were actually grounded in the story and characters, so that I could care about them.<br/><br/>Worst film I've seen since Mortal Kombat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Smerg" title="Smerg"><img alt="Smerg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Smerg">Smerg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320277/#Comment_320277" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-13T08:07:32+00:00" title="April 13, 2011  8:07AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A&gt;  I liked this film.  I liked how it combined wildly different genres in the visuals and was using this as backdrop to work out conflicts in 'reality'.<br/><br/>Now, there have been some comments on the 'dream' sequences.  My own take on this is that it is a bit of social comment on the 'game' industry that has been having women in bouncy leather and spandex from games like Street Fighter to Lara Croft to City of Heroes to whatever is latest to be released this week.  Gravity and genre defying moves and events with women is a cultural way of life for some people.  It makes game companies big money.  It is all escapism and it shows 'Babydoll' fighting back in the only way she can in a society that controls what is 'beauty', what is 'allowed', and exploits her for their own desires (men are the villians from the Step Father to the Assistant).  Babydoll has no 'voice' in the beginning of the movie and discovers her 'voice' during the movie through the Therapist who treats her and the other girls.  The bus driver is the only male figure shown to treat a woman decently in the movie which shows there is a possibility for change.<br/><br/>All and all, that is some pretty heavy social commentary on life and society wrapped up inside of what appears to be a fluff piece.<br/><br/>B&gt;  Game wise, I'd go with something that has an end game mechanic.  These are throw away characters.  After you have completed the story of the asylum, you're not going to 'continue' the story.  The end story of each of the characters is the 'important' part of the game.<br/><br/>The game has a series of 'quests' for objects.  The objects don't matter as they are really just 'colour' items and the group of players could choose any five things they wanted and those would be the 'significant' items in the story.<br/><br/>The same goes for the various 'villains' of the story.  You could choose any five figures as long as they represent 'sleazy' men for the villains of the story.  They are really just symbols of the society that oppresses the women in the story and usually treat them as sexual items to own, rule, and possess.<br/><br/>The focus of the story is on the characters relationship to each other.  There is a great amount of battle between trust and distrust between the characters.  This is the core battle of the game.  Events in the battles are used to alter these relationships.  If things go well then they are more likely to work together and trust more and if things go poorly then there is more likely going to be a lack of trust which will make it harder to succeed in later conflicts.<br/><br/>The players also go through separation and isolation points where betrayals occur.  A player that you might trust could actually be working for the Asylum.<br/><br/>The 'dream' sequences are just a vehicle and allow the players to have a quick 'play' point to break up the 'trust-betrayal' the success on these moments also effects the 'end story' of the various characters.<br/><br/>Based on the above information, I'd use something like 'The Mountain Witch' to represent the story.  The 'abilities' are the various 'weapons' the player has for their dream sequence.  The dream sequences are the various 'chapters' of story.  Each player has a 'conflict' to get through the challenge and the players can choose to co-operate or go alone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell" title="J B Bell"><img alt="J B Bell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell">J B Bell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321131/#Comment_321131" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-18T16:51:46+00:00" title="April 18, 2011  4:51PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hated it. My twitter review was something like "a trifecta of offensive trivilizations of mental illness, abuse of mental patients, and rape." I guess some blame can be laid at the door of the motion picture ratings board in the USA, an evil, stupid star chamber if ever there was one. (See <i>This Film Has Not Been Rated</i> if you'd like to see its raw idiocy exposed.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose it could work as an RPG though; often terrible stories make perfectly fine RPGs. Not sure how you'd handle the basically zero-risk fight sequences though; they made me yawn. Breathless, 13-year-olds' freeform seems pretty apt to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321138/#Comment_321138" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-18T17:38:51+00:00" title="April 18, 2011  5:38PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2011 5:44PM by PaulB.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So despite multiple repeated warning to not see this, I finally saw Sucker Punch. :-(<br><br>I hated it but, weirdly, two days later I'm still gnawing on <i>why</i> I hated it.

There's not a single moment that treats pandering as anything but an end in itself, and J B Bell is right on that it trivialized every bit of the subject matter. (and like I said earlier, it even fails to pander. At least Heavy Metal had sex and violence in it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Imperator" title="Imperator"><img alt="Imperator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/569/nUS8BD26ISIQN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Imperator">Imperator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321301/#Comment_321301" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-19T23:45:31+00:00" title="April 19, 2011 11:45PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The trailer looked so absolutely retarded to me that I haven't watched the movie.

The only message here could be "Give us your money so we can keep doing retarded films full of cliches and slow-mo fights, the promise of tits and ass and nothign more."<br/><br/>And that is just from watching the trailer. You have to try really hard so your movie looks so soulless in a trailer.<br/><br/>System: I would not play such a game, so I'll pass.
