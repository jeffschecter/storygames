I'll finally get to check if the endgame plays out as expected! But today I'll talk about the first session, and its (relative) failure.<br/><br/>To cut a long story short, we are playing an awesome <b>investigation</b>.<br/>Which is a problem :P<br/><br/>See, in previous playtest (<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20311/touched-by-evil-gm-less-lovecraftian-horror-playtest-one" rel="nofollow">one</a> and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20368/touched-by-evil-gm-less-lovecraftian-horror-playtest-two" rel="nofollow">two</a>) the characters were indeed investigating... looking for answers, puzzling about mysterious things, figuring stuff out... but the dread and unease at the table were palpable and steadily increasing during Chapter 1.<br/><br/>This time around we got almost to Chapter 3 without such feelings.<br/>The fiction, the story, is textbook horror and we are having fun, so all is good in a general sense; but the specific aim of this design seems to have failed.<br/><br/>We chatted about it all and after painstakingly analysing all possible culprits I think we found the one key element: <b>Chapter 1 shadows</b>.<br/><br/>All other Shadows will reshape and redirect the Players' ideas, but the ones from Chapter 1 are the true foundation upon which everything else rests. If they are done in the wrong way, the dread just does not happen (at least, so far).<br/><br/>The <b>setting</b> is not important: we are on a transport space-ship.<br/>The TOs <b>roles</b> are not important: we have the Chief of Security, a Pilot in training, an Engineer and a Miner passenger.<br/>The <b>catalyst</b> event is not important: an accident happened, causing an explosion that killed one man.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, all these elements are VERY important in their own way, but they were not the cause of the current mishap in summoning dread at the table.<br/>Let me show this to you.\n<blockquote>Chapter 1 - Illusions<br/><i>something is <b>off</b>, out of place or \u201cwrong\u201d in an undefinable way</i></blockquote>\nSo what we did wrong was to create Shadows that were "strange and out of place" for very <b>obvious</b> reasons, instead of <b>undefinable</b> ones.<br/>Through a series of scenes we produced, in this order:<br/><br/>1) <b>- victim was out of place -</b><br/>So there is an explosion which, among other problems, causes a guy to die. Apparently he was a miner, a passenger, and the accident happened in a restricted personnell-only area ... thus his body is out of place.<br/><br/>2) <b>- the sound of the ship feels wrong -</b><br/>You know the sound of the hull of a ship? The structural groaning? Well the engineer guy noticed that is somehow felt wrong, not as usual.<br/><br/>3) <b>- Paul is missing -</b><br/>One of the miners is nowhere to be found.<br/><br/>4) <b>- this ship was supposed to be decommissioned -</b><br/>Turns out the ship is an old model scheduled for decommission; it's sturdy and all works well, but it feels a bit weird how the company chose to keep using this relic for cargo and passenger transport.<br/><br/>5) <b>- a chemical smell -</b><br/>On the scene of the accident there was an undefinable chemical smell.<br/><br/>6) <b>- Paul looked ill the morning of the accident -</b><br/>At breakfast people saw him pale and not eating anything, although he said he was perfectly fine.<br/><br/>7) <b>- the ship shook only for Lily -</b><br/>Our young pilot in training felt a strong vibration at the moment of the explosion... but she was the only one. Everyone else noticed nothing, and the structural analysis suggests that feeling the explosion all through the command deck was unlikely at best.<br/><br/>8) <b>- a vent system access panel was open -</b><br/>On the explosion scene a vent port was open, with no sign of having been reached by the explosion... someone must have opened it manually!<br/><br/>9) <b>- goo -</b><br/>Undefined gooey chemical substance in the ventilation system passages.<br/><br/>So, what are the problems?<br/>The problems are that the Shadows number 1, 3, 5, 8 and 9 are done wrong :P<br/>They are all things that looked odd and out of place, but for <b>very obvious reasons</b>:<br/>- the victim is out of place because a civilian is not supposed to be in a crew-only area<br/>- Paul is missing because he is the victim (it was already established at the table, but it also was yet unknown to some characters)<br/>- on the scene of an explosion there is a chemical smell... this is weird because at the moment nobody recognizes it just by sniffing the air... but we are all confident that an analysis will yield more info<br/>- the open vent panel is weird because it should have been closed; the fact that the explosion did not touch it is actually either too weird to be described without degrees of separation, or a very common detail that might reasonably have thousands of explanations.<br/>- again the goo is either too weird to be "just found" with no degrees of separation, or just something that NOW is unidentified, but LATER it just needs a run at the lab to become known and explainable<br/><br/>These Shadows were obvious, so it was also obvious what to do with them.<br/>The characters (thus the players) always had a clear idea of what to do next, what to do about them: investigate, analyse, follow the trail, compare, double check, etc.<br/><br/>These elements became in turn predominant in every Moment of the story, steering it towards more practical scenarios. As a result the other Shadows were almost forgotten; they became a curiosity no one had the time to think about, as the investigation was more present and pressing.<br/><br/>THAT is what was wrong.<br/>Imagine the list of shadows with only the <b>undefinable</b> ones:<br/>- the sound of the ship feels wrong<br/>- this ship was supposed to be decommissioned<br/>- Paul looked ill the morning of the accident<br/>- the ship shook only for Lily<br/><br/>Any of these things feels "off" for reasons that are undefinable.<br/>They suggest without telling.<br/>And there is nothing obvious to do about them, no task that can clearly be undertaken.<br/><br/>Even with the characters engrossed by the investigation about the mysterious explosion, having something like "<i>the sound of the ship feels wrong</i>" come up again and again in most Moments will set a very different tone, maybe leading the story in different directions, or maybe not but with a very different feeling at the table.<br/><br/>The focus on the investigation also somehow cut out some Players.<br/>The young Pilot had no active role in the investigation, and her Player kind of felt cut off from the main action.<br/>Which is very wrong... in the other playtests there were no tasks to solve so WHATEVER a character ended up doing it would be perfectly fine... go to your room and read a book? Perfect! A Shadow will turn this apparently meaningless and idle moment into something creepy and relevant.<br/><br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/><br/>So, this is my current analysis of the first session.<br/>I think we'll continue playing from here, in the middle of Chapter 2.<br/>We'll remove the wrong Shadows, and see if/how their absence influences the story.<br/>And of course we'll pay more attention at how we set new Shadows.<br/><br/>As for the "fix" I have to find a way to make the instruction for the Shadows of Chapter 1 clearer... stressing the <b>undefined</b> part.<br/><i>Something is wrong but you can't say what exactly, you can't put your finger on it, it's like a word on the tip of your tongue.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450704/#Comment_450704" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-17T17:10:08+00:00" title="January 17, 2016  5:10PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting analysis!
