                    Okay, so I can't hope to say everything I want to say about this topic in one post (especially since I have other things to do this evening), but an email conversation with Judd requires me to get this off my chest.<br/><br/>Judd and I exchanged a few messages about the "system" of freeform games.  Judd said that there must be something going on there that governs how people interact with each other in such situations and that we should be able to basically codify that into actual rules and mechanics and mimick that kind of play.  The recent discussion of <i>Theatrix</i> is also relevant here, because I suspect that's exactly what they tried to do.  Doing some of that can be really cool and effective, like the way Ben and Shreyas formalized inter-player negotiation in <i>Polaris</i> and <i>Mridangam</i>, respectively.<br/><br/>However, formalizing the freeform "system" (if you can even call it that) of a specific group of people in a set of rules and mechanics loses one of the most crucial aspects of freeform, which is its ability to change and adapt to new situations, new players, or just the constantly changing tastes, priorities, and (dare I say it?) creative agendas of the players involved.  Everything is arbitrary in a socially retricted way.  You can't do anything, but you can do anything you can convince the other players is a good idea, which can be dramatically inconsistent with the way issues have been resolved before.  Some systems, notably <i>Universalis</i> (but also <i>Polaris</i>, etc.) have tried to turn this kind of negotiation and convincing of your fellow players into part of the game, using inter-player conflict as fuel for inter-character conflict.<br/><br/>However, in the vast majority of freeform games I've been involved with, inter-player negotiation isn't viewed as something enjoyable or something that escalates tension.  Instead, it is a royal pain, something to be avoided at all costs.  You only stop and negotiate something if a player objects (which you are encouraged to do only when absolutely necessary) or when the narrative has become self-contradictory.  So codifying something that most freeformers (again, in my experience) avoid like the plague and making it a crucial part of your system is neat and all, but, if your point is to replicate the advantages of freeform in a non-freeform game (and you might not care about that), you're barking up the completely wrong tree.<br/><br/>I think trying to turn freeform into a set of rules and mechanics (something that we already understand) as a way of grokking it usually tends to destroy freeform in the process, not allowing it's real nature to translate well.  You may end up with a really cool ruleset, if you try such a thing, but it's not necessarily going to play or feel like freeform.<br/><br/>So how do we talk about freeform in a systematic fashion?<br/><br/>Within the rather different worlds of systems thinking, organizational structuring, communications theory, lingustics, and anthropology, there is the concept of a <i>community of practice</i>.  This concept was first developed by Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger and is detailed in the following publications, if people want to check them out:<ul><br/>Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger (1991) Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation. Cambridge University Press.<br/><br/>Wenger, Etienne. (1998) "Communities of Practice: Learning as a Social System," Systems Thinker.  <a href="http://www.co-i-l.com/coil/knowledge-garden/cop/lss.shtml" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.co-i-l.com/coil/knowledge-garden/cop/lss.shtml</a><br/><br/>Wenger, Etienne. (1999) Communities of Practice: Learning, Meaning, and Identity. Cambridge University Press.<br/><br/></ul>According to Wenger a community of practice is defined by three things:<br/><br/>1. Joint Enterprise<br/>2. Mutual Engagement<br/>3. Shared Repertoire<br/><br/>The simple version explaination of this is as follows:<br/><br/>A group of people come together to do something, whether it's to live together in harmony or to play <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i>.  They are together because they have a shared purpose, a joint enterprise.  Their joint enterprise need not be fully defined in the beginning.  They may develop a sense of purpose over time and only slowly begin to uncover what they're all about.  Also, their joint enterprise can shift or change as the relationships of group members and the ties binding them together evolve over time.<br/><br/>They are involved in communicating with each other in all sorts of ways.  Vocal communication, body language, etc.  And more than that, they are committed to communicating with one another because it is crucial to their shared purpose.  You can't build a house with someone if you can't communicate with them.  So you have to continually be engaged with other people in the group in an effort to understand them and to have them understand you.<br/><br/>A by-product of working together with a group of people on a project is that you developed regular patterns of behavior, a shared repertoire, which allows you to communicate more easily.  You develop shorthand for certain communication acts.  You develop the kinds of everyday ritual activities that Chris Lehrich is fascinated by.  You develop what Neel Krishnaswami once dubbed a "shared symbolic language": you know that butterflies are the spirits of the dead and represent both death, the past, and the ancestors.  All of these regular patterns of behavior are accumulated as a part of communicating and working together on something.<br/><br/>Over time, the shared repertiore becomes a kind of Status Quo, a language that outsiders have to learn how to speak if they want to communicate with members of the group and really be a part of the community and the joint enterprise.  This is quite likely while some people don't feel comfortable on The Forge, long-running collaborative fanfic games, or other places where the existing community, over time, has developed an ideosyncratic way of communicating/behaving among themselves based on many, many previous conversations.  The Status Quo is also a way of doing things, a set of fixed behavior patterns.  Over time these become traditions and then, eventually, "the way things are done," even though, when they first started, they may have been an accident or a misunderstanding.<br/><br/>Of course, the shared repertiore doesn't have to become hegemonic or a kind of Status Quo if the people involved keep changing the "rules" or the overall goal, or changing situations call for different kinds of solutions or approaches.  And so you can see various communities of practice evolving over the course of human history, from communities like Harvard or Cambridge to communities like RPGnet or the Forge to communities like your Friday night <i>Shadowrun</i> game.  Even communities with a strong sense of Status Quo can change if enough social pressure is exerted by members to overturn habitual practices or change the overall shared enterprise.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's an introduction to the basic concept.<br/><br/>To return to my original point, I think most freeform games tend to operate as very clear and pure communities of practice.  Every roleplaying group is a community of practice, but, when a group chooses to adopt an outside rules set as the basic for play, that can sometimes obscure the fact that they are actually making everything up, in a certain sense.  Not every group plays <i>D&amp;D</i> or <i>Exalted</i> the same way, with various rules or subsystems being emphasized or ignored by different people at different times.  If you pay attention to what happens in a group, you can actually observe improvized practices become habitual, most clearly through "inside jokes" and the like, which are a clear example of shared repertoire.  But the same thing happens with the way different rules are invoked or different situations are resolved.<br/><br/>When do you decide when you should roll for something and when you should just talk your way through it?  Pay attention to the way this is determined, next time you start playing a new game with a new group.  In the beginning, rolls may be called for on a somewhat inconsistant basis.  But, after a few sessions, you should notice that everyone has a sense of when die rolls are needed and when they're not, based on the way you've handled them in previous sessions.<br/><br/>Okay, now I have to do other work.  Please discuss.                </div>

                            This is a good overview of how groups determine the way that things are done. They fall into habits and routines. The problem I see is that there's an underlying assumption that these practices are good and work well. There's quite a chance that you have practices developing that aren't as much fun as others that could be gained by communicating and openly agreeing on rules and mechanics.<br/>
<br/>
I've seen plenty of freeform play that was subject to bullying.<br/>
<br/>
I've seen plenty of freeform play that was frustrating for all involved because of the practices that people thought were mandatory.<br/>
<br/>
I've seen plenty of clashes among players who just could not agree on the practices, no matter how hard they tried.<br/>
<br/>
Once you start communicating and openly establishing the practices, though, we're getting into the territory of formalization.                        </div>

To me, this describes any kind of group roleplaying.<br/>

1. Joint Enterpise - we're here to play for these agreed-on goals, which we'll achieve in this way.<br/>
<br/>
2. Mutual Engaement - we're here to do that together, and support each other in the ways that we consider appropriate.<br/>

<b>Judd:</b> This isn't intended to be prescriptive, but descriptive.  This is what is already happening in your gaming group.  This is what is happening in freeform gaming groups.  They are fundamentally the same thing, though the approach is rather different.  You'll have to give me a few days if you want me to talk prescriptively about how to facilitate the creation and healthy functioning of a community of practice.  That's at least another 3 pages of text <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><b>Xeno, Mark, Levi:</b>  I think you're missing the part where I said "every roleplaying group is a community of practice," though I think freeform groups are the clearest example of this and tend to be a bit more self-aware that this is what's happening (though there are certainly some groups who thing that "this is just the way freeform is done").  All communities of practice can have lots of problems and power issues and what not.  Freeform groups and traditional roleplaying groups share a lot of the same concerns in this regard, but I don't think it necessarily has anything to do with having a formalized set of rules or not.  <br/><br/>And the point of this post wasn't really to talk about the power-relationships in communities of practice (that's a WHOLE nother set of papers I need to read) or how to resolve inter-player issues.  I'm just trying to put forward an alternative method for thinking about what it is that creates a group's "system" (I'm using Vincent's definition of system as "the way in which players decide 'what happens' in the game"), because I've found it very useful in my thinking recently.                        </div>

No, I get that.  What I was trying to find a way to say was that it's the stuff *in* those three things that gets you into freeform territory.  Let me see if I can put this plainly.<br/>
<br/>
A freeform game is one in which the Enterprise, Engagement, and Repetoire are fully governed by the group, and not in any way by an externally-referenced structure.<br/>
<br/>
There's been a tendency in games to clean up the structures presented by the game so that they can "carry" certain parts of the group - in many groups, their whole repetoire has been refined from things in the books.  <br/>
<br/>
There's also the indie tendency to focus the repetoire so that it creates specific effects.<br/>
<br/>
A freeform game, by definition, discards that, and *must* find compensating strength in those three things without the benefit of structure.<br/>
<br/>
...If that even makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: added the words "externally-referenced".                        </div>

<b>Levi:</b>  I think freeform games tend to have a lot of external references too, actually.  Past games (freeform or otherwise) played by any or all of the participants are a major one, but calling that external is kinda cheating.  Fanfic games based on existing media (books, movies, whatever) have a large body of source material to draw from and try to follow the dramatic guidelines of the genre or specific narrative style that they are trying to emulate.  Then there's the shared history of non-game-based interaction between members of the group and the social situation that exists between them.  There's a reason that freeform is most easily done with people you know well, because you can rely on existing patterns of social interaction to form the basis of your system, and then just tweak it from there.  But, yes, I think we're more on the same page than I thought at first.  Sorry about that.<br/><br/>Also, I think it was Annie Rush who said that she prefers to have a rules set and then ignore it completely, rather than to play without a rules set (and that's exactly what happened in the Exalted session I mention in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=640" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>), so it's possible that some freeform play happens with essentially the exact same set of external references as traditional play, but the rules just never get invoked.  Isn't that cool/odd?<br/><br/><b>Judd:</b> Thanks.  I'll try to get to it sooner rather than later, in any case.                        </div>

                            The wife had to do a lit review for a professor a while back as a research assistant position - part of her doctorate work.  Anywho, it was on communities of practice as it pertains to special education.  Not only did I have to read the lit review itself, but I also reviewed about 1/3 of the articles, including a lot of the baseline stuff like Wegner.<br/><br/>I certainly agree that there are large chunks of communities of practice that apply to roleplaying games, and to freeform.  However, there are some disparities - here's the big one as I see it, at least as Wegner describes them:
<blockquote>Whether these communities arise spontaneously or come together through seeding and nurturing, their development ultimately depends on <b>internal leadership</b>. Certainly, in order to legitimize the community as a place for sharing and creating knowledge, recognized experts need to be involved in some way, even if they don't do much of the work. But internal leadership is more diverse and distributed. <br/><br/>These roles may be formal or informal, and may be concentrated in a core group or more widely distributed. But in all cases, leadership must have intrinsic legitimacy in the community. To be effective, therefore, managers and others must work with communities of practice from the inside rather than merely attempt to design them or manipulate them from the outside.</blockquote>
Wegner's main point is that leadership is internal - but the point that I'm trying to make is that leadership is an <i>intrinsic</i> part of communities of practice.  As I understand it, freeform is all about consensus instead of leadership.<br/><br/>The second point to be made here is that as Levi said - many groups take their leadership from an external source - the rulebook.  You can make a case for communities of practice with roleplaying games - but as in the application of any other sociological model, it only takes you so far with gaming.                        </div>

<b>Levi:</b> I can't really tell if I agree with you or not, at this point.  You're definitely right that traditional gaming groups reference external stuff for authority in a way somewhat different from the way it happens in most freeform groups I've been a part of.  But I think "roll d20!" is also strongly related to "What would Whedon do?" or other external principles (even if they're not discussed during play) in freeform games.  It could be that we're thinking about different aspects of the same situation.<br/><br/><b>Kuma:</b> In my experience internal leadership is pretty critical even in groups where consensus is the goal.  After all, somebody has to decide <i>when consensus has been reached</i> and move things forward.  And, often, that authority is given to the person who organized the game in the first place.  I think complex power relations definitely exist in consensus-based social environments, with different players taking a lead in describing different things, about players trying to decide if they're going to object to something or not, with certain players actions being especially hard to question (such as the founder of the group).  Also, if the group starts floudering, who steps forward to try to fix things?  So, I don't know.  _I_ see internal leadership still applying to all types of roleplaying.<br/><br/>Also, I think there's been some consensus reached, at least among indie designers, that characters can't really have desires and feelings that the player doesn't attribute to them and, likewise, rules don't have any authority that the player group doesn't give to them.  So arguing that rules, in traditional play, have some sort of intrinsic authority or leadership ability seems odd to me.  It seems more likely that players use rules as a way of exerting personal leadership.  "You can't do that!  You have to roll for it first!"  Or, "Now, according to p. 136, we should do this..."  So, again, I don't really see the discrepancy.<br/><br/><b>Graham:</b>  Maybe I should try to provide a preview of where I'm eventually hoping to go with this.  I guess I'm hoping to develop mechanics that don't attempt to circumvent the natural development of a community of practice, but instead support it.  One example might be allowing the patterns of character or player behavior to be invested with a certain weight, so that habits are mechanically reinforced.  Shreyas's upcoming game, <i>Torchbearer</i> attempts to do this by reinforcing the regular appearance of certain symbols or other color with its Torches.  But the game doesn't predetermine tell you what those colors and symbols should be and allows them to change and evolve over time.  <br/><br/>And I'd like there to be games that don't advocate handling everything in a consistent manner, because I think human beings have a tendency for inconsistency as well as a tendency towards patterns of behavior.  <i>Everyway</i> tries to get at this with its various ways to approach something (fortune, drama, karma, etc.) and a lot of GMing advice advocates knowing when to make players roll and when to just talk things through.  But I don't think we've found a really satisfying way to be inconsistent yet, and I don't think it's because inconsistancy is inherantly unsatisfying.<br/><br/>On the mutual engagement front, I think Mo's really onto something with her discussion of Push/Pull, that people can be much more functionally engaged with one another than often occurs naturally, if they are given certain tools for communication.  There's a lot more to be said here, but I don't want to totally derail this thread.<br/><br/>So that's the tip of the iceberg, I guess.  Maybe that gives you a better sense of why this excites me so much?                        </div>

<b>Graham</b> (and Jonathan and Judd), what I get out of this, even though I have never enjoyed fully freeform RP (at least when I recognized it as such), is that RPGs in general contain large chunks of freeform procedure. One of the criticisms of "traditional RPGs" that doesn't sit well with me is that their freeform components make them "not work" or render them subject to abusive authority. Well, if we regard traditional RPGs as a subset of freeform RPGs, albeit with access to formal procedures when the latter are invoked within the overall freeform procedure, then whatever analysis, solutions, or practices Jonathan may propose for pure freeform will also apply to games of this hybrid variety.                        </div>

                            Gah!  I wrote a long response to you, Judd, but the internet ate it!<br/>
<br/>
Here, read Erick Wujick's very short article on dice vs. diceless play!<br/>
http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/24/<br/>
<br/>
Your character approaches a ravine, you roll dice, you succeed!   The GM says, "You leap over it!"  Voila, dice-full play!<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, your character approaches a ravine.  You say, "I leap over it easily!"  The GM says, "What's your Aspect?" (You're playing Nobilis.)  You say, "3."  The GM says, "Hell yeah, you leap over it and probably do a triple lutz on your way over."  Voila, diceless play!  (The same example would work with negotiation in Polaris).<br/>
<br/>
Finally, your character approaches a ravine.  You're playing Exalted.  You say, "I jump over it easily and proceed on my way."  One of the other players says, "Come on, you can do better than that!  Where's the tension?  Shouldn't you roll Dex + Athletics [dice!] or invoke a leaping Charm [diceless!]?"  You say, well, the ravine doesn't really interest me.  But I have a really cool idea for the wall of fire."  The other player says, "Cool.  What happens at the wall?"  You continue playing.  Voila, freeform!<br/>
<br/>
My point is this: you are playing freeform all the time in games.  Whenever you say your character is doing something, no one objects, and you keep playing, that's freeform.  Whenever you're brainstorming about what the next scene will be about: freeform.  Whenever you're trying to negotiate a change to the way you're handling armor classes: freeform.  When ever you handle anything without consulting mechanics or dice, that's freeform.<br/>
<br/>
And that's what Eliot's trying to say I think.  Traditional play is just freeform with some additional stuff tacked on.                        </div>

Labelling any interactions that do not require reference to dice or stats as "freeform" is way the hell oversimplifying things.  That makes, for instance, the Dogs rule "Say Yes or Roll Dice" a freeform rule, which is laughable.  That single rule has shaped (ie, given form) to lots and lots of gameplay that, in the absence of such a rule, would have proceeded an entirely different way.                        </div>

<em>Traditional play is just freeform with some additional stuff tacked on.</em><br/><br/>Jonathan, this is a rhetorical powerplay.  It's also not very useful for the purposes of any discussion about freeform.  When you say "freeform" you mean something -- a style of play, a social contract, a group of people, the games that they play -- besides "the root of all roleplaying the world over".<br/><br/>It would be far, far more worthwhile to say that freeform and "traditional" roleplay both make use of the same foundational principle (Lumpley) and go from there.  Because freeform is not simply the lack of dice and stats and mechanics; it's something different, requiring different techniques and satisfying different agenda.  We'll get a whole lot more done if we use positive definitions instead of reductive definitions.<br/><br/>(Revel in the irony of me saying this.)                        </div>

                            JBR:<br/><br/>But "Say Yes or Roll Dice" is a rule.  You could come up with the same concept in a freeform-ish way (i.e. our group agrees that you have to say yes or . . . roll dice!), but if you're playing "by the rule" and that's why you Say Yes or Roll Dice then that's a structured mechanic.<br/><br/>Freeform play != shapeless and formless play.  It just shapes the play in ways that are harder to describe and define, instead of using explicit rules to do it.<br/><br/>Jon may, of course, tell me I'm a moron and that I've totally misunderstood what he meant.

                            I think saying, "Freeform play is the root, and the explicit rules are added on" is not necessarily meant to be truth - it's meant to be one perspective about what role-playing games might all have in common.  The question is what that perspective lets you see that you couldn't see before.  In this case, I think it illuminates the hidden freeform practices in even the most structured game, and it's definitely useful for that.  Arguing about whether or not is Objectively True maybe isn't the most useful way to use this tool of perspective-shifting.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

Judd didn't seem to be getting "all roleplaying is based on a community of practice" so I tried "all roleplaying is really freeform."  It's not as good, I agree.

                            Judd, I think the others have done a reasonable job. GM Fiat is a problematic term because it ascribes more power to the GM than needs to exist within the context of a "traditional" game. If we assume that freeform play can work without explicitly concentrating authority in a single person, it follows that you should also be able to have play where, e.g., the decision to move from pure discussion to round-based combat, and any sequencing entailed by the transition, is handled socially.<br/><br/>Basically, if there's no overarching explicit procedure within the rules, but you do have some mechanical procedures on which the group agrees, then freeform is the method by which the group frames its invocation of the mechanics.<br/><br/>I would like to point out that DitV does have some significant freeform qualities. For example, "what is a legitimate raise?"--a fundamental piece of procedure--is not formally defined and must be socially determined.<br/><br/>Incidentally,<br/><br/><i>Traditional play is just freeform with some additional stuff tacked on.</i><br/><br/>is ironic for me personally, because I had more experience with wargames of the Avalon Hill/SPI variety when I got into RPGs. What seemed special about RPGs wasn't that they provided structure for imagining but that they provided <i>freeform context</i> for simulative rules-sets. Get rid of the freeform (of which, introduction of the GM role is a <i>major</i> innovation compared to traditional board games), and IMO the attraction of the RPG form starts to fade.                        </div>

I prefer to break it down even further, since one roleplaying group will change their purpose and repertoire from game to game -- my playtesting circle changes these nearly every week, and this last week when we played two different games, we changed things without even leaving the table.<br/><br/>Someone, somewhere, is using Sorcerer to run a dungeoncrawl.  Whether or not they're doing it "right" or doing it as Ron intended, they're engaged in an activity that they call Sorcerer.  How much of that activity is composed of Sorcerer rules from the book and how much is just the way that that group normally plays is a big fat open question, and not one that can really be answered with a fine grain specificity.  And then you throw houseruling into there, and things get really muddy.                        </div>

When the meanfull answers differ too much to cohere as one thing, we stop looking at them as a larger community, or we start looking at why those individual ones differ and how, and look for patterns in one that might help the others.<br/>

                            To respond to Jess' anxious questions:<br/>
<br/>
One thing I really dig about the communities of practice stuff is that it gives us a way to talk about ALL roleplaying (not just tabletop, not just larp, not just online freeform) in a way that allows us to make generalizations about what people are doing that are still accurate.  Everybody goes through the group socialization process.  Everyone's involved in creating a negotiated space in which communication and play occurs.  Etc.<br/>
<br/>
However, talking about things on such a meta-level, while great for analyzing the practice as a whole, is not necessarily going to make your play experience better.  You might understand what's going on more clearly, but putting things into practice on the group level is going to require looking at your own community of practice, not on some meta-community that binds all of roleplaying together.<br/>
<br/>
So there's the huge sprawling community of practice that is ALL ROLEPLAYING.<br/>
<br/>
And there's the small, individual PLAY GROUPS.<br/>
<br/>
But in the middle, there are also other communities of practice.  There is, for instance THE FORGE and STORY GAMES and PEOPLE WHO YAK ABOUT EXALTED ON RPGNET and PEOPLE WHO WORSHIP MONTE COOK and CHANGELING FANS all sorts of other medium-sized communities.<br/>
<br/>
And being a part of those communities of practice influences how we behave and conduct play in our own personal play groups.  So I guess what I'm trying to say is that we can make generalizations at all sorts of levels, not just the super meta or the individual group.  <br/>
<br/>
You might try to argue that "individual play groups which are heavily influenced by The Forge or are attempting to run Forge games of a certain era tend to exhibit these kinds of qualities."  It's still a generalization, but it's based on the idea that, as a community of practice, various behaviors and tendencies of Forge participants have been normalized by their interactions.  It's harder to be really sure of this when it comes to online communities who have talked about roleplaying but, in many cases, never actually played games together.  But you could try to make a good case for it.<br/>
<br/>
Does that answer your question, Jess?                        </div>

<br/>
Communities of Practice. A diggable concept.  It helps us see that the procedures used for freeform (and other) play are arrived at as a group process, organically &amp; based on mutual need &amp; interest.  Cool.<br/>
<br/>
So why does this mean that those communities are not using procedures that can be understood, even if they are implicit or unconsciously applied by the players?  Or are you saying that?<br/>

                            Hey Emily!<br/>
<br/>
Er... I didn't think I was saying that.  I thought I was saying that, sure, we could try to get a handle on the procedures that individual groups use, but I tend to think that, by the time we got a handle on one set of procedures, the procedures would have changed.<br/>
<br/>
I think what I'm trying to say is that the actual procedures themselves may be less important than the process of developing and changing procedures.  This is getting a little confusing, though, because we're talking about different layers of procedures.<br/>
<br/>
You have:<br/>
1) Game procedures, which handle game events (usually formalized)<br/>
2) Meta-game procedures, which handle changing or inventing new game procedures (usually unformalized)<br/>
3) Social procedures, which handle player interactions (usually unformalized)<br/>
4) Meta-social procedures, which handle changing or inventing new social procedures (usually unformalized)<br/>
<br/>
I'm guess I'm thinking about designing systems that formalize the meta-procedures, offering players systems for determining how they want to play, but not telling specific groups how to play, instead encouraging them to use the meta-systems to determine that themselves.                        </div>

                            A distinction I make is between mechanics &amp; guidelines. Mechanics are specific, formalized procedures of play. Guidelines are rubrics that folks can refer to to get on the same page, but that are not quantified &amp; subject to interpretation.  (I know that someone did a good job of discussing subjective vs. objective rules, was that Chris?) <br/>
<br/>
Would you be giving people guidelines for play? What would an example be of a meta-game procedure.                        </div>

By the very nature of things, you know that just talking about what you're calling "Meta-game procedures" and "Meta-social procedures" with a group will likely change them, right?<br/>
<br/>
I just find that somewhat interesting, is all.                        </div>

<b>Emily:</b> So there's another post/article I need to write on "guidelines," but I can try to summerize my thinking here.  Thomas talks about "contraint" which is one kind of guideline, which is like, "We're telling pirate stories, so everything that happens needs to be very pirate-like."  Is that what you mean?  I'm all about that.<br/><br/>The easiest example of a meta-game procedure I can think of is Rules Gimmicks in <i>Universalis</i>, where you can change the rules of the game by invoking a meta-rule.  How's that?  Rules Gimmicks are still pretty basic, open ended, and not genre- or color-specific, though, so I'm interested in meta-game procedures that are a little more... uh... interesting.<br/><br/><b>Levi:</b> You're right that formalizing meta procedures allows players to muck around with them, which is part of the point of formalizing them, so that people mess with the details of the Social Contract and other meta issues explicitly instead of just implicitly.  Also, yeah, any conversation or interaction has the potential to alter the existing social situation.  Which is awesome.                        </div>
