                    Hi all,<br/><br/>I've begun running a full-on battlemap-&amp;-miniatures, 5-foot-step-laden, attack-of-opportunity-filled, oh-dear-Christ-it's-a-mindflayer-riding-a-beholder-tastic D&amp;D game using Monte Cook's Ptolus over VoIP, with my friends and I wallowing in the crazy numbers and fruity variant rules of D&amp;D like pigs in shit.<br/><br/>But indie gaming has worked its beguiling sorceries on my brain, and I'm trying to use various indie principles like flags, conflict webs, and scene-framing to enrich the game. I'm curious how it'll interact with D&amp;D's prep-heavy gamism.<br/><br/>However, I've not run much D&amp;D3 before, and it's been ages since I've run a campaign. So I've started posting my prep over <a href="http://www.sonsofkryos.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=238" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and begging people for comments and suggestions. I'm especially looking for flags I might have missed or misread, suggestions for conflicts and situations, advice for reducing D&amp;D's prep-time, and tricks to speed and ease play.<br/><br/>The setup is this: the characters were members of the bizarre household of the Iron Mage - the greatest wizard in the city - until one day the Iron Mage vanished, his tower tore itself apart, and they found themselves homeless and broke on the mean streets of the world's weirdest city. All of them start with a level in a class and a level in a race (half-dragon, tiefling, and runechild), and two Keys, one of which relates to another PC:-<br/><br/>Typhon: Half-dragon gladiator-slave and ex-doorman.<br/>* Key of the Guardian (Puer)<br/>* Key of the Mission (Win his freedom)<br/><br/>Tesha: wayward tiefling warlock, daughter of the demonic House of Gaunt.<br/>* Key of the Teenage Crush (Puer)<br/>* Key of the Rebel<br/><br/>Pure: Runechild Diviner and self-proclaimed apprentice of the missing Iron Mage.<br/>* Key of Fraternity (Typhon)<br/>* Key of Conscience<br/><br/>The referenced thread also has links to a post about the pre-game discussion with the players, and one about the pilot session that set up the situation. But the game proper begins on Wednesday - the characters are loose in the city now, and I'm beavering away getting things ready.<br/><br/>All comments and advice will be greeted with a level of gratitude that frankly borders on the pathetic.<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>

                            One thing I've done with my D&amp;D3 is to limit the amount of source material I use from the outset. That way there's never any question about whether this feat or that feat is unbalanced, just whether it's in the materials I've identified to use.<br/><br/>Another thing is to Xerox the pages from the DMG with the NPCs and their equipment loadout, and use that as my NPC generation tool. Get a stack of index cards and if you think of an NPC, scribble a few notes about them on the card, then chuck it on the pile. Then when you are improvving and need an NPC you already have a 'cast'. The same is true of locations (although Ptolus has so many locations already that you're almost certainly good to go.)<br/><br/>One last thing: in D&amp;D3, high level characters are not just heroes - they are also celebrities and people love to talk about celebrities.<br/><br/>I'll post more tips as I remember them.                        </div>

                            Hiya,<br/>
<br/>
I've been running a D&amp;D game for the past couple of months, and when we started we decided that all of the players would share in the decision-making processes in the game, so that everyone has the chance of getting and/or doing the things that they think would make the game really cool for them.<br/>
<br/>
Now, this being D&amp;D, a lot of the focus of our games is on using miniatures for combats against various foes. That's fine with us -- we decided going in to the game that we wanted to play a hybrid between a miniatures game and a role-playing game, and D&amp;D fit the bill very well.<br/>
<br/>
If that's going to be a big part of your game too, then I'd recommend using the "Fantastic Locations" series of accessories published by Wizards. Each booklet has two full-color double-sided poster-sized maps scaled for use with miniatures, and they help you make big beautiful encounter scenes for the game. They have published five so far:<br/>
<br/>
Fane of the Drow: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/950037400" rel="nofollow">http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/950037400</a><br/>
Fields of Ruin: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953640000" rel="nofollow">http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953640000</a><br/>
Hellspike Prison: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/950047400" rel="nofollow">http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/950047400</a><br/>
Dragondown Grotto: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953777400" rel="nofollow">http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953777400</a><br/>
The Frostfell Rift: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/957557400" rel="nofollow">http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/957557400</a><br/>
<br/>
Each one also has a 16-page scenario booklet, but I usually ignore it and just use the maps for the game. The "Fane of the Drow" has good maps for underground dungeon encounters, and "Fields of Ruin" and "Dragondown Grotto" both have good maps for outdoors &amp; wilderness encounters.                        </div>

                            A small suggestion based on my experience with TSoY:  I notice that nobody has a Key related to Tesha.  I'd suggest, if at all possible, getting each of the three to have a Key related to each of their two companions.  Once that is in place, your job gets way easier.                        </div>

                            Hi guys - thanks for the suggestions!<br><br>JD - I'll definitely use that technique for statting NPCs. So far, creating NPCs has been the real time drain where prep is concerned. I've been pointed at a couple of sites with pre-generated characters on, which should help, too.<br><br>I like the idea of playing up the celebrity angle of high-level adventurers, as well. I've been fighting the urge to do a reality-tv thing with bards following around adventurers and churning out adventurous tales for the masses.<br><br>Rick - We are going for the maps and miniatures style of play, but we're actually playing over VoIP, with a shared map tool. The Fantastic Locations look like exactly what I'd want to use, if they were available in an electronic format. I know WotC offered some of their books as pdfs for a while, but I can't seem to find them now. I've been using the maptiles from Skeleton Key Games, which are great, but I'm always looking for more. Pretty maps do good things for the game.<br><br>Jason - That's a good idea; I'll talk to the players about this - we all agreed an extra key would be a good idea, and it'd make sense to use it to define everyone's relationship with each other.<br><br>Thanks for the help, everyone!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            In that case, try some of the jpg files from their map gallery: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/arch/ag" rel="nofollow">http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/arch/ag</a> </div>
