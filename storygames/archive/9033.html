The Ongaro are sentient apes who share a bond of kinship with their \u2018less smart\u2019 human cousins who represent the last bastion of their mysterious and largely forgotten heritage. The Tusk is a dangerous place filled with hazards and monsters, but it is certainly safer than the world outside: the battleground for the war that throttles the world between the Hawklite Sky-lords and their avowed enemies the Serpenteel Empire. <br/><br/>Beyond their border in the Mountains of Leng lies the inscrutable and impenetrable city-state of the Mentasians whose slaves are said to live in bliss. The Mentasians are seen as gods by those who have any knowledge of them, beings of unearthly and ancient quality whose history transcends the limits of history.<br/><br/>The Chakra-Cities of the Tiger Alliance are guarded by peerless warriors who serve a caste based system in the name of preventing the world from falling into corruption. Each city is located in a unique and specific part of the world and is ruled by Somaticians who espouse the use of Soma, the powerful elixir that gives the Tiger Warriors their power and the Somaticians their wisdom. <br/><br/>Seemingly beyond the world the city-state of Lunarsopolis lies seemingly beyond the edge of the world and the Sea of Stars. Here one can stand amid its exquisite and fragrant gardens and take in a view of the whole world. Travel to and from this fiercely independent state is done only with the support of its Merchant Princes and its lonely queen, Celestia Selene. Yet Lunarsopolis can be seen from almost anywhere in the world \u2013 if one\u2019s eyes are open at the right time. It is as near as it is far.<br/><br/>Gemsoulled are cursed with wanderlust; if they remain in one place they gather entropy in the form of Rust which will age them and eventually decay and destroy them. For this reason they are perpetually active/moving. These machine beings are born of ancient alchemy unknown even to them. There are rumoured to be dangerous places, in the world, known as Genesis Pits, wherein the Gemsoulled were once (maybe still) forged. Such places are toxic and dangerous. The Gemsoulled come from an age of machines and are not the only living remnants of that time. It is supposed they were fashioned as soldiers. But other machine creatures exist; some guard the Genesis Pits they occupy: Dieselasaurs and Steam Dragons rumoured to be the size of villages consuming and corrupting all with their mechanical toxins. One Genesis Pit is known to be near the Tusk and is a source of many lost treasures (or so the stories go). This is also the home of the Lord Weird Shiva \u2013 the Wrought God. He is a being that has made the Pit his home and used it and his knowledge of forbidden sciences, to become immortal. His followers (slaves) are known for riding tamed Dieselasuars on raids throughout the area; may Rivas are the subject of his personal experiments using the power of the Genesis Pit on mortal flesh.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>I don't know how to exploit these ideas, but they are born of a far future-esque (ie implied) sword &amp; sorcery (&amp; planet?) setting.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199705/#Comment_199705" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T10:27:22+00:00" title="March 31, 2009 10:27AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One idea: Mine your setting description to create a Wicked Age oracle, then just play in the setting using IAWA.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/signoftheserpent" title="signoftheserpent"><img alt="signoftheserpent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/signoftheserpent">signoftheserpent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199720/#Comment_199720" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T11:38:54+00:00" title="March 31, 2009 11:38AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd rather create something all my own really.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199753/#Comment_199753" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T14:00:41+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  2:00PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't understand your question.

I think it's kind of implied the protagonists are humans who stand up from being nursed and travel the world in search of their past/destinies with all the other stuff as adventure locations: each place/race you visit/battle grants another piece of the puzzle why the human empire fell. I would however much rather play a Hawklord flying around killing shit and taking their stuff which is also very S&amp;Sy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/signoftheserpent" title="signoftheserpent"><img alt="signoftheserpent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/signoftheserpent">signoftheserpent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199896/#Comment_199896" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-01T06:23:16+00:00" title="April  1, 2009  6:23AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 1, 2009 6:27AM by signoftheserpent.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            firstly the stuff that's implied in the setting is meant to be only ever implied. It should always remain ambiguous as to whether this is far future/post apocalyptic earth, etc. This is deliberate because i want people to create their own impressions of what's happening. So i won't say whether a human empire fell explicitly or how the Ongaro evolved or whether Lunarsopolis is actually what it seems.<br/><br/>As to what the players do; well in that regard this would be a very trad game. IE the players are adventuring around as they would in something like Barbarians of Lemuria or even D&amp;D. They will fight monsters, meet powerful people who fight for evil (or good), save the world and rescue the slave girl (or guy, or...).<br/><br/>I envisage picking from one of several classes, for a character: Fighter, Thief, Scholar (somewhere between teacher, guru, diplomat, and sorcerer), and Healer. Then customising that with Origin - where the character comes from: Tusk, Mentasia (escaped thrall of the Mentasians or something), City of the Hawklites (though not the Serpenteel because they are baddies through and through - not that the Hawklite are much better), or Tiger Alliance. Each origin will customise the class with a unique ability, for example:<br/>A Tiger Alliance Healer, aka a 'Vedicine Man' (named after the healing arts of the Alliance) has yogic healing abilities - imagine a S&amp;S version of Dhalsim from Streetfighter.<br/>An Ongaro Fighter has powerful battle rage strength.<br/><br/>All fairly straightforward stuff. I don't envisage a ton of options for the simple reason that more choice doesn't necessarily mean more depth. Complexity for it's own sake is intellectual masturbation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
