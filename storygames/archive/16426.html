The systems of the games manipulates the verbal telling of the game, but almost never the player bodies.<br/>Which is a shame, because the body is a great tool to create powerful gaming experiences. Our bodies and senses have a lot of power to affect what we are feeling.<br/><br/>I feel like experimenting with that, yet stay within the physical restrictions of tabletop roleplaying places. Like that most people probably play in a quite small kitchen or living room when people can't run around. So I will assume people are going to stay in their seats, and not move across the room.<br/><br/>I wanna have psychical aspects and experiences as part of the roleplay on a system level. Not just the \u201cI use my body for playing my characters body language\u201d but also in symbolic ways. <br/><br/>The of physical sort of things I come up with and think could be explored, without braking the assumption that people will stay in their seats is:<br/><br/>Eye contact<br/>I think a lot could be done with this. Holding someone gaze creates a lot of tension, that could be used in awesome ways. One simple way to implement it that characters need to speak the truth when they have eye contact. Either as a part of the fiction (The characters are mages, and you cant lie to a mage while looking her in the eyes) or just a part of the rules system OOC.<br/><br/>Touching hands<br/>Touch is a great tool for communication, and out hands are generally not \u201dprivate\u201d body parts. It part of the body we generally let other people, even strangers touch in everyday life. Yet they are sensitive and very communicative. <br/>Generally, at most gaming tables, groups can place themself in such a ways that two players can reach across the table to touch hands while sitting down. Perhaps placing their hand on the table as a signal when it times to reach out and this technique to take effect.<br/>One way this could implement it could be for players to touch the other players hand in a way that expresses how the character really feels. (Describing how someone acts really warm towards someone outwardly, but bu grasping the other players hand not at all gently show that the character actually is really angry at the other player. The angry, and hard grasp giving you physical experience of that anger.)<br/><br/>Standing up<br/>Standing up as marker for the player slipping into monologue mode has been done a bunch of times, and is a great example. (Erm. Technically you don't stay in you seat, but you stay in your place and it can be done at most gaming tables, by most people.)<br/><br/>Whispering<br/>This is actually vocal, but using \u201dstage whispers\u201d to communicate something on another level of the game then what is said in a normal voice during a scene.<br/>Could for example be used for giving a character in play emotional impulses.<br/><br/>Gestures<br/>Gestures to indicate taking out of character, cutting the scene etc, is used my many groups but could perhaps taken even further.<br/><br/>Any one else got ideas like this and wanna comment?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375501/#Comment_375501" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T11:40:33+00:00" title="May  1, 2012 11:40AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2012 11:43AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love this stuff!<br/><br/>Some prior art:<br/><br/>In Beast Hunters, the twoplayers "salute in", making symbolic physical contact.<br/><br/><a href="http://elizabethrstark.com/2011/11/09/intro-to-ars-amandi/" rel="nofollow">Ars Amandi</a> is a technique for representing physical intimacy using only "public" touching.<br/><br/>The Confessional in InSpectres, when you designate a special chair or location for it.<br/><br/>Polaris: Light a candle to initiate play, snuff it to end the session.<br/><br/>Off the top of my head, there's lots more.

That way, you don't need to stop the flow for the "hey, are you just acting or are you really mad right now?" conversation that can really kill a charged emotional moment.<br/><br/>It also works great if your acting out something like a coughing fit or something.<br/><br/>I like to place the OK sign over my heart with my right hand. That puts it in a place that is easy to see (unless you're doubled over with fake coughing), but holding it up against the body makes it feel less intrusive.<br/><br/>But yeah, a lot of the work in this area has been done by larp groups rather than tabletop groups. But there is some definite potential there for using it in tabletop. <br/><br/>I particularly like the idea of using eye contact as a significant and meaningful thing. I think I read about a game that used eye contact rules to enforce caste positioning, which was a major theme being explored in a particular game.<br/><br/>And I seem to remember about a game that was meant to be played by a small group of people holding hands in the dark, but I don't remember the details.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375522/#Comment_375522" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T12:22:42+00:00" title="May  1, 2012 12:22PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Until We Sink is so elegant.
