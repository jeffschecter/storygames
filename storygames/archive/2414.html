                    Just speculating: What sort of RPG would be the polar opposite of a Story Game, would you say? Since Story Games are a subset of all RPGs, I'm thinking there must be some sort of gaming experience at the complete other end of... some scale.                </div>

                            I don't get it. How can a game have an opposite? Would the opposite of chess be chess except with a black square in the lower right corner?                        </div>

                            Yes but with the black square in the lower Right corner you are playing Ssech which if I remember correctly from the Encyclopedia of TlÃ¶n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius is the most popular game in Tlon. The pieces represent features from the midevil political structure of the country. the pieces move about the board based on their story needs and when two pieces meet the players roll dice and discuss their situation. Sometimes discussion is not enough and the players escalate from talking to Pushing then Fighting and finally gunplay (which was most precient in the midevil game)                        </div>

                            I don't think there's a polar opposite; however, a game which does not aim for some kind of collaborative storymaking and, in fact, discourages it, is a pretty different beast. Strictly one-person viewpoint, no collaboration on player-level during the playing, very thin meta-level.<br/><br/>For some odd reason, a character immersive LARP comes into mind. Because we hates the story.                        </div>

                            So, to summarize what has been said above: Story games was a term created in an attempt to end these debates. It wasn't intended as a neologism, but rather a "stop the label debates, guys." When people dismissed something as being "not an RPG", it still fell snugly into the wider, less-elitistly-drawn net of a story game. To ask what the "opposite" of such a game is...<br/><br/>...any game that opens with the introduction, "This is a roleplaying game. Breaking the Ice isn't, because it has no GM."<br/><br/>I think this kind of thread can do more damage than good (or at least waste more time than do good).                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>So, to summarize what has been said above: Story games was a term created in an attempt to end these debates. It wasn't intended as a neologism, but rather a "stop the label debates, guys." When people dismissed something as being "not an RPG", it still fell snugly into the wider, less-elitistly-drawn net of a story game. To ask what the "opposite" of such a game is...<br/><br/>...any game that opens with the introduction, "This is a roleplaying game. Breaking the Ice isn't, because it has no GM."<br/><br/>I think this kind of thread can do more damage than good (or at least waste more time than do good).&lt;//img&gt;&lt;//img&gt;</blockquote>
Well, I think there can be potential benefits if you avoid the trap you outline.  Rune apparently is great for its kind of play, and I think a conscious grasp of what they wanted it to do and what didn't matter really helped with that.<br/><br/>So I agree that in a divisive sense it doesn't help, but in a positive sense it could.  In the sense, story games rock but I want this time to create a different rocking thing.  What do I need to think about to get a different style of rocktasticity?                        </div>

                            Max, <br/><br/>I agree that those are different categories. Very different. And having different categories and using them to compare and contrast and figure out what you want on any given night is a good thing. <br/><br/>I don't know that they're opposites though. Like... field hockey isn't the opposite of soccer, it's just a different game. We're talking genres and categories, not Derrida's binaries.                        </div>

While somehow avoiding the question "What is a story game?", can you tell me how you see high character immersive LARP as different from story games?<br/><br/>Or are you saying that high character immersive LARP is the complement to Rune?                        </div>

I've never played or read Rune, but otherwise, I'm pretty much in agreement. And it's not like these different "genres" are opposites or compliments in everything; it's more like having a set of sliders representing some abstract parts and goals of the games. Some sliders are very far apart in some genres (like with the "story") and some are closer to each other.                        </div>

<p>Yeah, I see that this could do that, and it's a good thing to try to do. I am glad that anyone is even trying to do it.</p>
<p>But I think that, instead of talking about oppositions, it'd be less divisive and destructive, and more constructive, to talk about games as clusters of common goals or qualities. It's a little thing, and subtle.</p>

                            Merten and Balbinus got it.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn't trying to provoke people, build fences or anything like that; I'm kind of surprised people read that into my post. Apparently the word "opposite", for some, has connotations I wasn't aware of. I shouldn't have started talking about subsets (I'm not really interested in the complement of SG's - which would just be a list of all games that aren't SG's); I meant opposite, being well aware that the term would be hard to apply, and thought it might be interesting to discuss what scales/dimensions - and what centre points/origo - different people would use to define "opposition". Just as an intellectual exercise, for fun, and perhaps as inspiration for some experiments in gaming.<br/>
<br/>
For example, someone might conceivably say: <i>"Well, if we use D&amp;D 3ed as the origo, and draw a line from Story Games through D&amp;D 3ed, at the other end of that line we'd have a lot of games where narration was split up into a thousand discrete statements, all having the same importance and length - since Story Games often use 'one conflict roll pr. scene', and D&amp;D 3ed has several task resolution rolls pr. 'scene'".</i> Or someone else might say: <i>"Let's use children's play as the origo - that's what everyone knows. Compared to children's play, SG's more often have set goals and end states, and tend to focus on conflict between characters. On the opposite side (of children's play), you might find a game with no end state whatsoever, having no conflict at all - perhaps just a conversation, or a game in a static world of no interaction".</i>.<br/>
<br/>
(The reason I asked is that I've made a lot of games lately, and one of them seems to me to be the opposite of a Story Game. It has hardly any player influence whatsoever; the plot is completely predetermined, to the point that players are reading bits of pre-written text along the way to describe events. The characters are in a confined, dark space, and can talk, but hardly act. This set me thinking: What other forms of not-at-all-Story-games are there?)                        </div>

One of the scales I've been thinking about has been The Setting; in a lot of Story Games, the setting seems to be dynamic. It's constantly in flux, with new things being added to it by the players. Not so in the character immersive LARPs and tabletop playing - they have a rather static, pre-defined setting, in which the players don't add new stuff, and while GMs can, they rarely do.                        </div>

                            To help Matthijs out a bit heres my two cents (and they are mine not Matthijs').<br/>
<br/>
Over the past year the norwegian game-designer scene (as represented on rollespill.net) has been growing in leaps and bounds. And as time has passed there has developed a divide in play-philosophies. And spearheaded by Matthijs there is a group of game-designers who have developed a style of play that does not fit with the story-games paradigm (as far as one can say that there is a paradigm). This has recently been dubbed the Holmestrandtrend (or Holmestrand school right now cause it sounds cooler) and the games made by this highly induvidualistic group share these common denominators.<br/>
<br/>
They are very experimental in that they break with traditional RPG structure both in form and in theme. (this could fit a lot of the SGs as well)<br/>
The games try to convey a state of mind and an experience rather than a situation or a dramatic story.<br/>
These games are invariably rules light, yet the few rules they have are very strong and serve a spesific purpose.<br/>
Narration rights are very often distributed through dice rolls, game-specific narration cards or left totally in the hands of a narrator or narrator function.<br/>
These games very often move the rules up from the table or away from the SIS and into the social sphere of the players playing the games.<br/>
On very specific trend is that they have little or no explicit use of resources/currency and there is a heavy reliance on freeform techniques.<br/>
<br/>
This form of games takes more inspiration from the swedish Jeepform and the danish con-scenario models than it gathers here or ove at the forge. LARP and LARP theory also affects this outlook. The design philosphy seems to be one more of intuition than one of structured design, but for this I have just conversations with Matthijs to back me up on.<br/>
<br/>
As of late both Mathhijs and me have wondered whether this may be a cultural phenomon between two very diametrical outlooks, me being the more american free-marked kind of guy, with him being the norwegian social-democratic hippy feelgood person. And I would venture a guess that this might be what matthijs is fishing for here. <b>Without putting you all in any boxes you do not want to be in, or chasing you back into the trenches</b>. Because if there is such a divide, the big <b>next</b> question is how can we exploit the friction in this to create even greater games.                        </div>

                            Kaare is pretty much on the right track... but I haven't been talking about this outside of Norwegian fora. I've seen debates and "debates" about cultural differences, and attempts at discussing differences/similarities between RPG schools of thought, and they tend to crash hard.<br/>
<br/>
But here are a few things I believe right now.<br/>
<br/>
1. There are differences between U.S. culture and Scandinavian culture.<br/>
2. However, you'll always be able to find USAns who are more in tune with the Scandinavian mindset, and Scandinavians who think more like USAns.<br/>
3. Some of our cultural differences are mirrored in the assumptions behind the games we create &amp; play.<br/>
4. It's impossible to perfectly define the differences. Any description will be in general terms, and it will be very easy to find counter-examples. That doesn't mean the differences don't exist, or that it can't be fruitful to discuss them.<br/>
5. Some games are such extreme examples of their respective cultures that they seem almost pointless for players from another culture. Others are very easy to transfer from one culture to another.                        </div>

And, if you're talking about roleplaying cultures (instead of culture at large), there are differences in culture between the Scandinavian areas, as the probably are differences between various areas in US. The cultures build around communities, and roleplaying cultures build around communities that play and talk about playing together.<br><br>(The local hippy feelgood persons are doing the cultural exchange in Knudpunkt soon enough, while us grognards stay at home and rally to defence our culture <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </br></br></div>

                            Although situation is just one element of exploration it seems that the majority of games produced in htese here fora all have focus on exploration of situation. We have countless post on how to turbo-charge conflicts, build situations, fruitful voids, fit characters, reward systems feeding back on them selves and what have you.<br/>
<br/>
The school of thought that Holmestrandians are building does not focus on situation. There are games where the focus of exploration is on color. And the reward system is built around the internal experience of said color (in GNS terms, not in blue or red terms). Games where there is no pacing except for the intutive inspiration given by a bob dylan song.<br/>
<br/>
And when I, being a more free-market kind of guy, try to speak of these here games with my fragile Big Model understanding there has been clashes. Mostly about them feeling like I am fitting the terrain to the map. Immersjonism is a big deal for these people, and its continual refusal to fit into Big Model thinking seems to serve as further proof of this difference.<br/>
<br/>
But Merten, I think there is also large cultural differnces in play here. A few weeks back while dicussing DitV the question was raised whether the difference between the apperante american realtionship with religion (ref the latest discussions at Anyway) and the apperant norwegian realtionship to religion, makes it impossible for norwegians to really play DitV as it was meant to be played. Now my identification with the free-market side of things ends at religion, but I can still plays DitV. For me playing a Dog in the Utha that may have been is no different than trying to play an elf in the forests of LALA. And here is the clincher. I have to see the Dog as an fictional entity similar to the elf, because I do not have the cultural inside knowledge to immerse myself in a Dog without resorting to stereotypes.<br/>
And then DitV doesn't work. (Because it works on the player, but a player immersing himself deeply into a character does, according to my understanding, not surface to make moment to moment reflections as a player. This became the conclusion to that debate.)<br/>
The point here wasn't to say that DitV doesn't work for Norwegians, nor that there is<b> one true way</b> to play Dogs. But right there was a disconnect between the culture of the Holmestrandians (or scandinavians as Matthijs blithly keeps calling them) and the culture of church as a part of daily life of America.<br/>
<br/>
This has as much to do with how we percieve you, as how you percieve us. Our predjudices and what we think the others are like. And I think this is why we have to thread carefully around this here subject. But there is a difference.<br/>
<br/>
Lets accept that, and find out how to use it.<br/>
<br/>

                            We call you Scandinavians (my mother, classic for her personal neologisms, calls you al Scandiwhovians). Though being of Swedish descent in part, I suppose it should be no surprise that the term Holmestrandian sounds pretty good to me.<br/>
<br/>
But I digress.<br/>
<br/>
Most every American is going to feel a distinct disconnect from the Mormon-esque church in DitV, religious or not. Moreover trying to stereotype Americans is more bound to failure than with most cultures, because, despite often seeming monolithic in many ways, we're a pretty diverse culture. I'd hardly classify myself as typically religious, for example. Or Greg Stafford who is a shaman of native american traditions, for another good example. I suppose he'd feel even less direct connection to the sort of organized religion portrayed in DitV than I would.<br/>
<br/>
The point is that I don't believe for a second that DitV requires any particular sort of connection to religion to work, but rather that it works for anyone who has a moral sense. Well, that's not to say that everyone is going to enjoy the subject matter. But merely that not having the sort of connection to religion that you're imagining Americans to have doesn't preclude anyone from enjoying the game.<br/>
<br/>
Now, that's not to say that there aren't cultural differences, or that they don't matter. Quite the opposite. Interesting.y I was talking to Christian Braun recently about Hero Quest, as we often do, and he wanted to make the religions in HQ work "more like they do in real life." In this case I did get an insight into the post-modern Holmestrandian POV, in that what he was saying is that he wanted to make things like religion in his real world homeland. Which I was quick to point out would make the game such that the cultures in play would be very different from most worldwide cultures today, to say nothing of fantasy cultures as they're typically found.<br/>
<br/>
That is, it seemed that he had figured that the rest of the world actually has the sort of relationship with religion that you're stereotyping Scandanavia with here.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting.<br/>

                            No Mike you weren't off topic. I was veering dangerously close with the DitV discussion, and meant it only as an illustration of how this disconnect pops up in a game som many of us loves. And I can understand that the type of mormonism in DitV disconnects with nearly everyone. But that exact religion wasn't the point.<br/>
<br/>
And since we already are playing with fire (cultural differences) lets drag religion into the pot.<br/>
<br/>
In norway we have a state religion, our brand of christianity. In America you don't <strike>(although what we see on TV one would venture to say you have aswell)</strike>. It appears to us through the channels we have contact with your culture that one is much more conscious of what religious practice you have than we do (again its easy to blame TV.) Because for the average Norwegian church is something you think about at christmas, when there is a wedding or when there is a christning/confimation. It is a place to visit when tradition demands so. The relationship to God is a private thing, one that we do not share in public, and our politicians (except for one party) do not offer praise in their speeches.<br/>
So I am not talking about a relationship with the DitV moromonism pr.se. but rather a relationship to your religion of choice (if you have one). Ours has been socialised, so we don't have a public relationship to it. It is more of a monolithic institution resisting change. That is the cultural disconnect that Matthijs voiced in the thread aptly called "Dogs and the American God".<br/>
<br/>
With regards to Matthijs' original topic this disconnect stretches further than mere religion and into politics and worldview. Therefor the free-market/socialism dictomony. From the Forge there has arisen games where one competes for the right to Narrate the outcome of given situations. For an Holmestrandian this is anthenema, since they have through freeform techniques and social contract already a system in place for distributing these rights. So their cultural bias which their outlook represents crashes with say Capes.<br/>
<br/>
The thread that started this is called Capitalism vs Socialism D20 over at rollespill.net, and it raises the question what happens if you play say "Capes in sosial-democratic conflict shy lets all be friends" manner. <b>Let us not compete</b> and see what happens. The game fails.<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=14730.0" rel="nofollow">Here an example of this by none other than Matthijs.</a><br/>
<br/>
And here I'll again venture a guess, that the main disconnect comes form an apparent competiveness in the Over There culture which is not present in our which is sadly more of a <i>do not think that you are anything special</i> culture. How does this affect the games we design?<br/>
<br/>
That is the real topic of this thread.<br/>
<br/>
Off course Matthijs can slap me all he wants for these guesses.                        </div>

                            (Okay, sorry for totally drifting the thread I started, and yes, if it's possible to split the culture stuff out, I'd be very happy.)<br/>
<br/>
Not slapping anyone, though I'm not really up to the task of translating those threads into english right now <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>
<br/>
Wrt Dogs and religion, I was surprised to see an incredibly long thread over at Vincent's blog where people discussed all sorts of religion 1) in public, 2) in a civilized fashion, and 3) with both passion and intelligence. In Norwegian gaming circles, any public discussion of religion will become a flamewar after about 4-5 posts. Which is why I never touch religion debates; I'm just waiting for them to blow up.<br/>
<br/>
Wrt playing Capes wrong: Capes is one of several games (along with the Norwegian hippie-style narration game "Inntil vi synker") that, to me, is an example of elements that differ between our cultures. The strong emphasis on conflict just to have your say, the use of competitive resource management which is meant to make the game fun for everyone - these were very alien to me when I first tried it, and still feel really weird. The game just makes me want to ditch all the rules and sit down and tell a story together. If you don't really want conflict, it's a pointless game. Much in the same way that, if you play with conflict and tactical resources and power battles, "Inntil vi synker" will be torn apart like a thin veil of gauze in a knife fight.<br/>
<br/>
Now, my theory is that while not all USAns will instantly grok Capes, many USAns have a greater chance of sharing the implicit assumptions behind the game. Competition is good for you. We can fight and still be friends. A competitive economy will work out well for everyone. Some of these assumptions are things some of us (Norwegians) were brought up to see as antisocial and disruptive.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, just for the record, I have played, enjoyed and designed competitive RPGs (Charles the Bald is superf****d, for example). It just took some getting used to.                        </div>

I enjoy reading about different forms of games, and in this thread I guess I was hoping for some hypothetical forms - as in, games <i>we haven't seen examples of yet</i>. However, it's also interesting to see how different people think about Story Games in relation to RPGs, and I agree that high-immersionist LARPs would be one possible "opposite" to Story Games.                        </div>

                            Okay. <br><br>In that case I'm only going to add two things to this discussion at the moment: <br><br>1) Culture is an aggregate pattern.

                            Part of it is that "Story Games" themselves tend to break down into several overlapping categories, and there's quite a bit of drift in the use of the term, even among the indie games community that has started using it.  Generally it seems to include:<br><br>-- more focused (and often shorter) versions of traditional roleplaying<br>-- more "Nar" versions of traditional roleplaying<br>-- more freeformy games (the Munchausen/Once Upon a Time tradition)<br>-- games with different kinds of authority distributions (variations on the GM-player thing)<br>-- games with non-traditional subject matter (copier repair men! a single conversation!)<br>-- games that draw heavily from non-roleplaying traditions (board games, Indian dance)<br>-- etc.<br><br>I mean, after all, Burning Empires and Baron Munchausen may both be "Story Games", but they're not really part opf the same design tradition, except in a very, very general post-roleplaying sense (they both were written by authors who hail from the roleplaying tradition).<br><br>So, yeah, most Nordic stuff would probably be considered "Story Games" by this community, though the indie folks tend to come from less of a larp background, so they're haven't been any major indie games larps that I know of, though maybe Prawn might count.  But, it seems like the opposite isn't true: "Story Games" wouldn't necessarily be recognized as kindred games in Nordic countries.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            (Kaare, I found the topic of culture of religion vs. playing Dogs a very intresting one. I'm not sure if I have anything intresting to add in regards with this topic, but something about playing stereotypes is certainly clicking at the back of my brain)
<blockquote><cite>Posted By:  Matthijs</cite>Wrt playing Capes wrong: Capes is one of several games (along with the Norwegian hippie-style narration game "Inntil vi synker") that, to me, is an example of elements that differ between our cultures. The strong emphasis on conflict just to have your say, the use of competitive resource management which is meant to make the game fun for everyone - these were very alien to me when I first tried it, and still feel really weird. The game just makes me want to ditch all the rules and sit down and tell a story together. If you don't really want conflict, it's a pointless game. Much in the same way that, if you play with conflict and tactical resources and power battles, "Inntil vi synker" will be torn apart like a thin veil of gauze in a knife fight.</blockquote>
I'm not sure sure if I can tie this to the the competitive US culture - I just don't know it well enough to even assume. I do know that we have big problems with playing a "Story Games" because their approach just is too different from what we're used to ("we" as in my play group in the Census thread, which could be extented to a large group of 25+ years old Finnish roleplayers/live-roleplayers). I'll try to illustrate with some more or top-of-my-hat "opposites":<br/><br/>Playing a Game vs. Interacting in a virtual world<br/>Empowering Players vs. Forgetting about players, empowering characters<br/>Seeking to build a Story together vs. Not caring about the story, just interacting in a virtual world<br/>Playing collaboratively with a lot of player-player communication vs. Not playing collaboratively, minimal player-player communication<br/>Using Rules to facilitate player-player communication and to work as safety net vs. Relying only on the social contract only<br/>Dynamic setting based on player input vs. Static setting, virtual world<br/>3rd person view vs. 1st person view<br/><br/>And so on. I'm not saying that these are absolutes and most games probably don't hang in these ends of the spectrum, though I'd instinctly pick out the Game vs. Character Immersion -division here, regarding to our little microculture. I'm wondering what's the take on that in Norway? <br/><br/>I think all the "opposites" in Character Immersion side can be rather easily traced to LARPs (and some trends that existed before them) around here, but commonly apply to tabletop playing as well (moreso to players with LARPing experience) - and one could take steps back to early 90's and see how things have come to this point from the humble days of Red Box D&amp;D. This change/evolution is what I'd call culture, in microscale. I'm not sure it can be tied up to cultural differences between, say, Scandinavia and US, though the topic is very intresting.                        </div>
