Even though we were unsure of how to play through this part, we got through it and we were all happy with the result.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt came to pass the Gemekaa possessed a god slaying sword, and had set herself to slay the goddess Mahrkusha. In the previous conflict it had been decided that Gemekaa managed to inherit/absorb/something like that the essence of Mahrkusha, and that the only way Gemekaa could slay the goddess was to slay herself. Kurosh, however, had promised the god Naraka a particular corpse, and the slaying of Mahrkusha via the suicide of Gemekaa would prevent  him from doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sword is a particular strength of Gemekaa. Kurosh has many particular strengths (recurring character, here), ranging from soul binding spell craft, to gorilla prowess, to mouth lasers (not joking). Mahrkusha, being a goddess, also has a host of particular strengths up her sleeve.<br/>\n<br/>\nGemekaa is inside Mahrkusha's tower in the the center of the large room on the ground floor, Kurosh is somewhere near the entrance, and Mahrkusha is kinds of where ever she wants to be, you know, being a goddess and all.<br/>\n<br/>\nGemekaa's Player: "I take the sword and I kill myself."<br/>\nBoth Kurosh's and Mahrkusha's Players: "Hell no."<br/>\nAnd then, dice! Round 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nKurosh tries to tackle her to prevent Gemekaa from opening her chest with the sword, Mehrkusha slows down time and tries to seduce Gemekaa then and there with her godly powers. Through truly awe inspiring rolls, Gemekaa actually manages to come out of this round successfully, with an advantage die. So, dice again, round 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nGemekaa's Player: "So, I kill myself."<br/>\nEverybody: "Wait, what?"<br/>\n<br/>\nI Think that is all that's needed to bring out our confusion. First of all, didn't we just roll last round to see if Gemekaa was successful in doing that? And didn't she succeed, since both opponents failed to stop her (as described by the dice)? But what about the advantage die? How is this "Kurosh and Mahrkusha are at a disadvantage" if they lost the one thing they were fighting for? Also, we have established that Kurosh was able to run up from the entrance to tackle Gemekaa, but that Gemekaa couldn't plunge a sword into her own chest even though the dice said Kurosh's tackle was ineffective?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the first bit of trouble was Gemekaa phrasing her intentions as "I kill myself" rather than "I plunge the blade into my chest." That way we could narrate the spreading pool of blood as the disadvantage and so on as they try to save her life. Or, we should have negotiated at the end of round one.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anybody can spot where the confusion set in I would really appreciate it. It was an awesome scene and I kind of wish it wasn't mostly rules discussion. Hopefully we can void it in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, this is not the same conflict as the one in my other thread, FWIW.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks guys!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368271/#Comment_368271" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-17T15:23:50+00:00" title="March 17, 2012  3:23PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, right after the first round, figure out exactly what is going on in the fiction. If Gemekaa's player is able to kill herself (yes the player should say how or what the character is physically doing), then she kills herself. The question is whether or not the other characters want or try to stop her.<br/><br/>A character can try to do something over and over and over, etc. What's important is that everyone is very clear about what is going on in the fiction. In other words if Gemekaa had tried to kill herself by stabbing herself and another character knocked the blade away, Gemekaa can still try to kill herself, but not with that blade.<br/><br/>Narrate actions! Intents are meaningless in IAWA.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368308/#Comment_368308" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-18T03:30:14+00:00" title="March 18, 2012  3:30AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't that just a normal conflict pacing problem? You get these when players insist on narrating the fiction in conflict with the way the rules pace conflicts. Saying that your character already succeeds ultimately and finally before the conflict has ended is like describing your character's attack in D&amp;D as a decapitation before the hit points have run out: it's against the implict assumptions of the game, even if nobody thought to write it in the rules that you have to follow the structure when narrating things. You get this all the time in any game that resolves conflicts in multiple rounds: D&amp;D, Dogs in the Vineyard, The Shadow of Yesterday, Sorcerer...<br/><br/>This stuff comes up time and again as players learn the rules of a new game. My solution is to simply revise the fictional situation more or less overtly, and then move on. "Oh, I didn't notice it just now, but of course you shouldn't have been able to declare that you kill yourself, as that's exactly what these other guy's are trying to prevent - we'll need to establish whether you get to die until the end of the conflict. Let's say that you succeeded in giving yourself a deadly wound, but because these other guys still have the subjective right to try to stop you from <i>dying</i>, let's say that you're not dead yet, just bleeding on the ground." Then just run a new round of conflict involving resuscitation attempts. Narration is not sacrosanct, and it's more important to ensure that the procedure of play runs correctly than to ensure that anything a player might have narrated gets incorporated. Players say all sorts of foolish things all the time, after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368338/#Comment_368338" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-18T10:35:26+00:00" title="March 18, 2012 10:35AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2012 10:37AM by jdfristrom.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's understood, though, that when you say "I kill myself" or "I kill you" in IaWA, just as when you say, "I stive your fucking head in" in Poison'd, what you really mean is you're trying to kill them and we'll find out if you actually succeed after we've engaged the mechanics.<br/><br/>Sadly, Ry's flowchart-for-conflict seems to have dropped off the interwebs, which clarifies things greatly. <br/><br/>So I gather that when Gemekaa says "I kill myself" the second time, she was answering? We're not in the second round yet, so she gets to narrate herself at an advantage? <br/>You could play that a couple of ways, I think. One is, you could say, "Woah, successfully killing yourself is a pretty over-the-top advantage, don't you think? You're supposed to be at an advantage, not outright won." and not allow it.<br/><br/>More fun, though - and somewhere Vincent Baker suggests this is okay, actually getting the thing that was ONYFD'd after the first turn, is grabbing the brass ring. <br/>So: "I kill myself. The sword is through my heart and I'm dead on the floor."<br/>Now - ENTER THE SECOND ROUND.<br/>Because, In This Wicked Age, who is to say that death is permanent? Or that the suicide will really kill Mahrkusha? <br/>This could go all kinds of fun places. Maybe Gemekaa wins the initiatve and narrates her spirit ascending to heaven or Mahrkusha's essence withering away or Mahrkusha dying - and then Markusha can answer with more godlike power use. Maybe she even narrates a time jump (another thing Vincent explicitly allows in forum threads)! "Mahrkusha is at my funeral and I, having ascended to godhood, appear and slay her with divine light"<br/>Or maybe Mahrkusha wins the initiative and narrates reversing time and resurrecting Gemekaa or recapturing the essence that was bound with Gemekaa and becoming stronger than before. And Gemekaa can answer with things like "Ok, she resurrects me but her spirit has been released and she is now vulnerable" <br/>In fact, in a way, you've done one of the bad habits - you've set implied stakes for the conflict, that Gemekaa lives or dies as a result of this conflict.<br/>Also, I don't think just because Genekaa is dead in the fiction it means she's any less powerful. Her stats are what they were - it's not until two of your stats go to 0 that you have to exit the fiction.<br/><br/>All that said, if I was in the heat of the moment, I don't know if I'd have the presence of mind to take the story there and I probably would have been, "Um, what?" as well.<br/><br/>The complexity of IaWA conflict is one of the reasons (the main one being that IaWA isn't GM-less and when I've tried to play it GM-less there have always been too many unanswered questions like 'how do we stat NPC's' and 'who frames the scene' and 'who has narrative authority right now') we've been experimenting with <a href="http://www.storygamesseattle.com/messages/boards/thread/21471592" rel="nofollow">Wicked Archipelago</a> lately.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/quincunx" title="quincunx"><img alt="quincunx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/quincunx">quincunx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368341/#Comment_368341" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-18T10:57:40+00:00" title="March 18, 2012 10:57AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is super helpful, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that the answer here is basically that there are more than one correct way of handling things, it just depends on how you (as a group) want to pace the fiction. I think this actually does clarify the rules quite a bit, since either way works.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yeah, we were totally doing a vague unspoken stake setting thing when we should have been contributing tot he fiction and pretty much nothing else.<br/>\n<br/>\n@jdfristrom<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second time she said "I kill myself" was her opening move in the second round (she won the initial throw down with the advantage die she just earned). That's where we had to ask: can she just say that? Why not? Both Kurosh and Mahrkusha failed to even change her immediate situation. So, they can do all of that, and still she can't get the sword in her chest? <br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately it was the "hey, we have the disadvantage, not an all out loss" that swayed or decision making.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I LOVE the time jump idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd be happy to keep talking about things, but it seems (for the time being) that my questions have been addressed.

The answerer says what happens in the fiction, with the only rule being that they have to make sure the right person has the advantage: "I kill myself, and the god of death appears and gestures to you, indicating that my fate in in your hands. You have the advantage."<br/><br/>So if she won initiative, she can't say, "I kill myself." She has to say, "I try to kill myself", and then the answerer will decide if she does or not. If she was the answerer she can totally say that she kills herself, as long as she narrates the proper person getting an advantage. (Of course, if she does that, she better have a good idea of what her next move might be.

That's Brand Robbin's "No You Fucking Do Not, Asshole."<br/><br/>If you say, "I decapitate him." Then IT HAPPENS.<br/><br/>If you say, "I kill myself." Then IT HAPPENS.<br/><br/>If you say, "I steal the rubies from the statue's eyes, use the magic to devour the souls of my enemies, and rule the kingdom in a hell that last for one thousand centuries." Then IT HAPPENS.<br/><br/>The only time it doesn't happen is if another player jumps in and says "No You Fucking Do Not, Asshole," or some variation. Now, it is really important that someone interrupts you, or the game probably isn't very interesting. <br/><br/>It's an important distinction, because the advice I give to all my players is not to worry about "try." Don't even think about what you <b>try</b> to do. Just tell us what you do. If someone has a problem with that, we'll stop you. If not, you get to show us how awesome and terrible your character is and we can keep the game moving at a fast pace.<br/><br/>It's also important because it helps break out of the stake setting mentality. There are no stakes. There are just actions and people trying to stop those actions. You certainly can make your action the very same one that other characters were trying to prevent, but you still don't succeed. Just because its a self inflicted wound, it doesn't make it any different than trying to cut off someone's head.<br/><br/>There is only one important result of conflict: the negotiated results (or injury and exhaustion if no one finds a happy negotiated result).  It's up to the group whether knocked away swords and other more colorful effects stick. I play pretty hard to the negotiation. If the player wants their sword back, they have it unless it was negotiated away (only after the conflict, not during!), but this especially goes for Particular Strengths that are tied to items.<br/><br/>Once conflict starts, the only way for that character to commit successful suicide is to try and negotiate it (whether winning or losing), or try again right after the conflict is resolved, if possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
