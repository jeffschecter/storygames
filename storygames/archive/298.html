                    I like long games. Those long campaigns lasting years, where you really get to know the characters and the world, and care about them, to the point of stuff happening in the game causes a significant emotional impact in the players? Those. I like overarching plots, and unepxected reversals on long-established "knowledge". I like investing in the game outside the sessions, whether it be post-production or setting enrichment, and I feel stupid doing it if we're just going to toss the game out in a month.<br/><br/>It's been claimed before that the open ended game, or "endless game", is usually marketed as a default setting in "mainstream" RPGs, and yet so few people ever really play years-long games (I couldn't find a link, if someone could hook us up...). I wonder if this is really so, and would love to hear from people here - how long are your games, usually? How long do you prefer them?<br/><br/>Which leads us neatly to our own beloved Indie games. The vast majority of them are geared toward the mini-campaign length, usually clocking between four and ten sessions. This, I assume, is not coincidental. Why did you design <i>your</i> game to last 6-8 sessions?<br/><br/>And lastly - what do you think would differentiate the designs of games intended to be played over six session versus those geared for fifty (40-50 sessions is the mean average for a weekly game lasting a year)?<br/><br/>(Hmm. This thread is actually about three semi-distinct questions. It's also a bit rambly. I wonder if it should be split)                </div>

                            1) How long are your games, usually? How long do you prefer them?<br/>
<br/>
The longest game I've been in is a D&amp;D 3/3.5 game that has stretched over about 4 years, with irregular play. We started senior year of high school, and then all of us players scattered for college, so we only get to play when we come back for break. Our characters started at level 4 and are now all in the 30's. And there's fun stuff about being powerful, and famous--my character is a bard with Epic Leadership and therefore has over a hundred level 1 followers, plus lots of unofficial fans/worshippers. (She is somewhat chagrined at the "worshippers" part.) And we have a town that we've cultivated from a small fort guarding a pass to a bustling city. That stuff is fun.<br/>
<br/>
Most of my games have been much shorter. I've been in several short-running D&amp;D games that petered out quickly. I was in a schoolyear-long Deadlands campaign, but stopped going about 3/4 of the way through due to, um, boredom.<br/>
<br/>
I've found, more recently, that I crave resolution of some sort. I'm in a Mountain Witch game, and I'm looking forward to getting to the part where we all kill the Witch and/or die trying. Also, I've found so many new games that I want to try out, that allocating time for a 4-year campaign for any of them means that I will never get to all of them.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, I'm in college, and I have no clue when I'll get to see some of the people I play with after we all graduate. And we're all seniors, busy with thesis or equivalents thereof, so we don't get to play every week. This makes a long-running campaign less than ideal, because I doubt we'll ever get to finish it.<br/>
<br/>
2) Why did you design *your* game to last 6-8 sessions?<br/>
<br/>
I have two game designs in the works. One is a 24-hour RPG that needs playtest and revision, and that has a limited arc. It's about children learning to experiment and have confidence in themselves in the safe space of a magical land. The obvious end to this is when the children have all learned an important lesson, because it means their stories are done.<br/>
<br/>
My other game is the Fantasy Heartbreaker I'm working on. That one I want to work well with one-shot, short term, and long-term play. One-shot and short-term are my highest priorities; I'm experimenting with limiting GM resources, and possibly supporting rotating GMs. Also, I think there need to be more games that can be played by people in my position, with irregular gaming schedules and moving around.<br/>
<br/>
3) What differentiates the designs of short-term versus long-term games?<br/>
<br/>
One of the main things is the existence of an end-point. Mountain Witch, Polaris, My Life With Master--they all have specific endgame conditions for the characters/story. Also, those endgames are obviously reachable within a smallish number of sessions.<br/>
<br/>
Admittedly, I think there's frequently a conflation of the concepts "has a specified end" and "is for short-term play". The Shadow of Yesterday supports long-term play, but characters stop being playable when they transcend.<br/>
<br/>
I think that long term games really need a way to keep producing interesting things for the players. D&amp;D has its newer and tougher monsters with different abilities. TSOY has Keys. Mountain Witch, on the other hand, is really all about the Dark Fates and Trust mechanics; they produce a situation that *has* to come to a climax.<br/>

                            I like short games, myself. I like inviting people over for dinner and then playing a game afterwards, without committing to a run of sessions.<br/>
<br/>
This is partly because I try to persuade non-gamer friends to play RPGs. It's much easier to say "Hey, do you fancy trying this tomorrow?" than "Hey, do you fancy coming round every Sunday for a few weeks...?"<br/>
<br/>
So Breaking the Ice was perfect for me and my girlfriend, recently. Dogs In The Vineyard was good (we used a short town).<br/>
<br/>
Most of the design attempts I've made have been short games, too. They were all quickfire, not too serious, play-in-an-evening games, which is how I tend to like to play. Perhaps it's just me.                        </div>

                            I like both long- and short-term games.  I haven't played in a campaign that's lasted longer than a year, but I really enjoyed those.  As Nir said, you really get to know the characters.  However, some of the folks I game with have erratic scheduling conflicts and so shorter campaigns are easier to put together and don't demand the constant attention that longer ones do.<br/>

Expanding on the "has an end point" issue, I think we have to consider "has statistics that count down". Zeal/Weariness in Polaris come to mind - they provide a tactile sense of a progression toward an end point.<br/>

I don't think it's just you. To clarify - I often enjoy the a one-shot with no long term obligations (more often then any other form of play, lately), but I still prefer the longer games. You don't play longer games *at all*? If that is the case, you are only the second case of this that I've ever encoutered.                        </div>

                            "What differentiates the designs of short-term versus long-term games?"<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to add that some of the indie games ostensibly designed for short-term play actually *can* handle long-term play, if the group's interest is there. The text of Sorcerer tells you that when you resolve a Kicker, you can pick a new one and keep going. A PTA series can continue indefinitely, with people picking new Issues and a new story arc. I've been playing with  PTA variant that allows characters to pick up and arc Issues on the fly during play, and then choose from their Issues for the upcoming episode both to determine Screen Presence and to act as a flag for the Producer.<br/>
<br/>
So the distinction may not be as far off as it seems. Selene said most of what I would have said - one of the keys is how well the design accounts for the incorporation of  new, relevant material into play. If you want to use some of Johnstone's Impro mojo, you can look at it as how well the design supports the regular cycle of breaking of routines in play and reincorporating material that "defines" that play. <br/>
<br/>
I've often thought that the petering out of campaigns over time is a result of not enough of one or the other of those two things happening on a regular basis.                        </div>

                            Landon: nailed it, I'd say, about what makes long-term campaigns happy and viable.\<br/><br/>This is, I think, part of why Transylvania Chronicles, at least the first few volumes, are so popular among White Wolf's customers. The downtimes give you all chance to introduce new themes and close off old ones, and also chance to significantly improve the things you choose to work at. So you see history happening a lot faster than you would in a chronicle without those big gaps.<br/><br/>(One might argue, and I have, that this means something's missing as an explicitly discussed option for no-downtime chronicles: faster improvement as a matter of course. But that's another subject.)                        </div>

                            For me, I see a couple factors out there floating around in gamespace:<br/><br/><b>There's So Many Goddamned Games</b>. <br/><br/>For that reason, I like playing games that take anywhere around 4-12 sessions (with some half-year games in there here and there) because there's just too many interesting games out there to just stick to one for too long.  I offer no hates for people who don't put a priority on playing lots of games, though: Chess clubs are a testament to the fact that you can play only one game for a long, long time and still find depth and excitement in it.<br/><br/><b>There's So Many Goddamned Games, Redux</b>. <br/><br/>Someone once mentioned that the gaming industry is hard to crack, because you are effectively competing for time with other games. I agree with that assessment. So pretty much any game I work on will be optimized for 3-6 sessions, have playable options for 1-2 sessions, and yet can be played longer without breaking too bad. I don't have the hubris to consider that people should be playing my games for three or more months straight when they could be playing other great games (board games, even), which is an often very conscious decision some folks have to make: What games do we play next, and at the <i>which other games' expense</i> do we play those games?<br/><br/><b>And yet, having said that...</b><br/><br/>I do like playing those 6-month games every once in a while (usually fantasy, uberplot, etc)... Not necessarily because they're "deeper" or "richer", but let's put it this way: After a hard week of work, it's nice to settle into a game world that's familiar and relatively stress/focus-free.  "Playing Hard" with a huge string of 2-3 session games can be a little tiring, I think, if you're in a strictly casual gaming group.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I spent many years chasing the long campaign.  It was the ideal, the apogee, the apotheosis of gaming: the one campaign that stretched across years and generated stories that you and your friends told among each other forever.<br/>
<br/>
I never got there.<br/>
<br/>
So, given the realities of my gamelife, I make short games.  I in fact make a lot of one-session games.  My "big project" FLFS can be played long-term -- but it's episodic, and each session is a different situation, with little-to-no carryover between sessions.<br/>
<br/>
In fact I think the episodic game is an important distinction to add in there.  There are short games that set up a situation and resolve it in a handful of sessions, there are long games that do the same over many many sessions, and there are games that set up a series of situations that are resolved in serial order.  There is actually a very big difference between the last two -- it's the difference between feature film and television, or short stories and novels.                        </div>

That is a very good point!<br/>
<br/>
Looking at it that way, i can say for certain that the games i am most interested in playing &amp; writing are of the "set up a situation and resolve it in a handful of sessions" variety. <br/>
It might be that managing things that way you can get a fair amount of "heft", without dwelling on one particular point until everyone's attention just peters out.                        </div>

                            I like games of all lengths. I'm versitile like that. However, these days I mostly go with short run games for two reasons. <br/><br/>First, it's just easier for pragmatic reasons of real life. With my friends and players all getting real jobs, real families, and really busy lives having the time and energy to invest into logner games gets harder. <br/><br/>Second, I have so many games and ideas bouncing about in my brain, that I want to be able to hit it and quit it so I can move on. If I know I can have 1 really good game in a year, or 6 really good games in a year, these days I'll go for the 6 every time. <br/><br/>However, when both of those things can be removed from the picture (such as when I play solo games with Mo, whom I can play with at times when I wouldn't be playing other games and with whom I have no problems scheduling play) I still will do long term (year+) games.                        </div>

                            Joshua: Brings up kind of an important distinction in long games - those which primarily feature episodic content, and those which feature longer serial plot arcs. My personal experience has shown that a long campaign has a much greater chance at longevity when there are shorter, more isolated stories to resolve. It's been much more common in my experience to have players interested in taking one character from story to story than to spend six months or a year on one large story told in pieces.<br/>
<br/>
How do you think the questions of the original post resonate with said distinction?                        </div>

                            I have been playing in a couple of games that have lasted over 20 years. One is dying the slow death of real life priorities. But the other one, Tripper is still at the steady pace of 1 to 2 sessions per month (except December which always seems to be too full of real life for gaming).<br/>
<br/>
One thing Tripper has for it is the rotating GM structure. In Tripper, the PCs can see the gates that allow one to travel between worlds. After we finish an adventure, we decide who is the next GM and what PCs will be in that adventure. Since the worlds have different rules, some are SF while others are more fantasy, and you don't play the same character all the time, it doesn't get boring.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, it isn't always engaging for me. I realized after the "Hare and Hound" PTA game at the last Dreamation convention, that I go to Dreamation/Dexicon for my role-playing fix and I play Tripper with my friends more for the socializing. That is not to say it is a bad game, nor is DOS a bad operating system, it is just that technology has changed, and I enjoy playing these new fangled games.<br/>
<br/>
Another aspect is we have grown older (over 40). The players in the group now have a total of 6 children, ranging from a pair of 2-year-old twins to a 14 year old, between them. That and other real life priorities make it hard to get everyone together. This makes games that can deliver role-playing fun with small prep and time commitment very appealing to me.                        </div>

                            I've given up on the long game IRL.  It's just too hard to keep running.<br/>

Online, though, it works.<br/>

I want to see a game (I'm not up to writing it myself) optimized for online play, which will support long-term play.  HeroQuest is working well, (Mike's game) but there might be improvements that can be made.                        </div>

                            I like stories that end. That's why Under the Bed is played one session at a time (though a <i>very</i> interesting long-term game was introduced to me at one point: come back to the Child every year or so), and that's why Shock: has Story Goals.<br/><br/>Shock: though, does something else: it deliberately gives you the option to keep linking stories together. It's entirely appropriate to keep playing with your huge pile of MinutiÃƒÂ¦, your "series bible", from story to story. There's no difference between a character dying, completing a story, or just starting a new character. The resources aren't lost; they stick with the player, not the character, so you can play story after story, picking up new character for as long as they're interesting, ending them when it's time, and starting new ones in that world.                        </div>

<br/>
I think the only way to tell a story is to have it end. You know how, when Antony speaks last at Caesar's funeral, Brutus loses his credibility? You know how the Death Star blows up? You know when Li Mu Bai dies? Those are powerful, right? They say "Brutus wants respect more than power." "It was worth the death of your aunt, uncle, and mentor, and all the dangers you faced." "You finally have a chance to tell the woman that you love that you love her."<br/>
<br/>
Those are the moments that show the value of everything else the protagonists have done.                        </div>

I'm with the Joshuas.  Stories that end are gooooooooood!  Plus, chances are that if I get to play it's going to be a one shot game, so I want a game to be able to be finished in season.  Shorter than a four hour season is good also.                        </div>

                            I'll throw out a half-baked thought, riffing off what others have said here:<br/><br/><b>It isn't a story till it ends.</b><br/><br/>Really. A story has a beginning, a middle, and an end. It has other things, like characters and conflicts, but those aren't in contention. A story without an end isn't a story... yet. <br/><br/><i>Implication:</i> All those people doing long-term gaming haven't created a story. <br/><br/>I don't think this is true. I think they create lots of interconnected stories. I think it is true that they haven't finished The Story -- as in, The Story of the Campaign, or whatever -- till the campaign ends. That feels dissatisfying to a lot of players, it seems. <br/><br/>You can still create short stories though ("We got hired by this prince to get his little sister back, and we traveled to the faraway land of Zagbutlick, found the magical Sword of Cuts Through Scales Like Butter, and killed this awful dragon and rescued the princess. The prince paid us handsomely in gold.")                        </div>

                            Well, I like <i>long</i> stories that end.  :-)<br/><br/>1) How long are your games, usually? How long do you prefer them?<br/><br/>During most of my gaming career, campaigns would be 3 to 8 months or so.  More recently, though, I've played in two 2+ year biweekly campaigns which have been a lot of fun.  One ended after 52 sessions, while the other is still going and will probably end after the 45th session.  The former, my Vinland game, was my favorite campaign to date, so I'm pretty positive about the possibilities there.  <br/><br/>2) Why did you design your game to last 6-8 sessions?<br/><br/>Well, I didn't.  My earlier homebrews have been aimed at at least 12+ sessions, while my most recent (Morpho Londinium) was single session.  <br/><br/>3) And lastly - what do you think would differentiate the designs of games intended to be played over six session versus those geared for fifty (40-50 sessions is the mean average for a weekly game lasting a year)?<br/><br/>Many games get more unwieldy over time.  Dice pool systems often mean that you're rolling more and more dice.  For example, Dogs starts out as a bucketful-of-dice game, and you add dice pretty quickly with each session.  Other games accumulate complex options.  D&amp;D only adds a level every few sessions, but you add on much more complication and options with each level.  For a long-term campaign, steady escalation which doesn't add many more dice or complications is good.  Rather than adding more feats, upgrade lesser feats to more powerful ones.  Add to bonuses rather than number of dice.  <br/><br/>Within the fiction, you need a stable state to return to, or well-defined arcs which end.                        </div>

                            I'm wierd. I don't aim for "short" heck I aim for tools to let people play and play and play. On the other hand I understand why people aim for short, our hobby often has a time constraint, you can't guarantee people available now, will abe available 6 months from now at the same time, and scheduling adults with kids, jobs, etc is a pain. So creating powerful, good sessions within the projected time frame is helpful to those kinds of situations.<br/>
<br/>
I on the other hand thing that giving people tools to set their own limits is better than prebuilt play, but thats my preference and experience based on watching people try and "do things different" within the constraints they're given. Tools and rules which allow players to determine their own optimal play time is a boon.<br/>

Sure, games can end, SHOULD, end, and wrap up. These baren't TV series we want to see languish year after year losing focus until they wind down and someone turns out the lights, but I think it better to encourage watching for clues to that situation's potential, than to shutdown prematurely.                        </div>

                            Yeah, so dig how it works in Shock:<br/><br/>You finish a story, whether it's an episode or a larger thing. Let's assume that your Protagonist is alive at the end.<br/><br/>You cash out your resources, turn them into a generic resource. Then you write down a character sketch for your next character. Now here's the important part: <i>it might be the same dude</i>. It could be John Carter or Conan or Flash Gordon, one story on.<br/><br/>... or it could be someone else entirely. You want to confront a different Shock than your Protag was designed to confront? Cool! Start with someone else. You get the same resources, either way.<br/><br/>You aren't penalized for ending the story, not even really in the time it takes to start a new character; that only takes a minute. Pick a spot on the Grid that's interesting, write down two numbers, thee phrases and a name, and you're ready to go.<br/><br/>You <i>have</i> to end stories; the mechanics demand it. It doesn't mean the end of your character (necessarily), it doesn't mean the end of your participation in the game (ever), it doesn't even mean you won't have a character by the next time it's your turn (uh, unless you're playing with only one other player). <br/><br/>What it <i>does</i> mean is that you have to do stuff that matters to you <i>right now</i> to play the game. Smash the space ship. Have a philosophical argument with an android. Gamble on the future of humanity. Do what you need to do and see what happens.<br/><br/>You do this for three or four sessions in a row, each time, getting closer to addressing your Story Goal. Then you throw down about the thing you thought really mattered a couple of sessions back, now with the full knowledge that's come over the last several sessions.<br/><br/>What happens, that's the ending.                        </div>

<i>I think most people are playing giant epic unwieldy plots, and their buy-in for the first dozen sessions is the sense of rising action and suspense, the feeling that they really are in a story and that something cool is going to happen eventually. </i><br/><br/>Since my experience is limited, I would hesitate to contradict this "most," especially since my gaming experience has not been with these heavily "plotted" campaigns. But what I have experienced (and especially run) is a lot of episodic gaming (and a lot of D&amp;D players who use modules are also doing this episodic gaming). With episodic gaming, there definitely are little stories that end (we cleaned out this dungeon, we killed that dragon). Now some of the modules are connected into a longer plot, but even then, I think they have shorter stories that end.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

My experience and observation is that most campaigns are made up of distinct "adventures" strung together.  I would be very surprised if the majority of campaign didn't have distinct adventures.  At least, nearly all of the published GM advice material that I've seen suggest preparing such adventures.  <br/><br/>I have seen other approaches.  For me, the first game I played in college ("Mirrorworld") was a big simulative environment with only a single big overarching situation.  It lasted 8 months or so.  I did something like that later in the Water-Uphill World.  However, it seemed to me to be a rare style.  Joshua, can you say more about your games?  What system(s) were you running?                        </div>

Albeit I think its one of mixed priorities (kids and job are not what I'm talking about here as that for me is a given FIRST priority ) but that  people spend an awful lot of time watching TV shows/sports/etc--these fun things in some cases take priority over others (gaming) and said people lament their lack of gaming, unfortunatly their issue is one of their own choice of priorities.

                            When I run, I tend to run short, one session stories, even in the confines of a larger game.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, Cthulhupunk was Lisa Padol's very successful set of two successive 6ish year campaigns (set in the same world, with many of the same characters).  A key to its success was that while Lisa tended to run one or two stories at a time (the second campain, +20, had more or less two sets of characters), she'd interweave characters intended to be important in a later situation into the current one, thus allowing for both resolution and continuity -- rather like a serial radio play (only with more continuity).  This even allowed her to use pre-packaged adventures organically within the confines of a continuing game -- she'd drop some of the characters into an earlier situation, and then use them to introduce the new one once the previous one had resolved in some fashion.<br/>
<br/>
This said, it's clear that many people trying to run long campains with traditional games don't do this, or don't know how to do this well.                        </div>

Having an Endgame gives the players something to work toward and the GM (if there is one) a tool to create suspense.  The more I design, the more I see the value of having a mechanic that cuts off play at some point.<br/>

All Illusionism, all the way.</i><br/><br/>Well, if it makes you feel any better, having a series of dungeon and/or wilderness adventures strung together doesn't make a campaign <i>good</i>.  At least, I've seen a lot of these which just struck me as enormously dull.  But it's a different fault than having an enormous meandering situation which never resolves.  My adolescence was mostly about games which never finished not because they meandered, but because we never got together for more than 3 sessions.  My college games were cool, but they were anomalous/wierd.  <br/><br/>Illusionism/Participationism is pretty common.  GURPS play is pretty varied in my experience.  The texts tend to suggest presenting realistic problem-solving challenges to the players -- difficult to balance, but potentially workable.  However, many people take it for the setting books and drift it wherever they want.  I did a few stints of GURPS in early grad school and later during my post-doc.  They were pretty functional, though never stellar.                        </div>

                            I believe there's another a big advantage that short games have---a short game allows a player to play for broke in a way they can't in a long campaign, except maybe under unusual circumstances.<br/><br/>In a long game, you can't play a real jerk of a character that will literally steal and betray and maybe even kill the characters at every available opportunity without fear that it will ruin somebody else's fun. I mean, it's no fun to have the character you have been playing for nine months backstabbed because he looked at another PC funny, or even to have that magical sword you spent 6 sessions searching for stolen and pawned for whore money.<br/><br/>But in a short game, that all is possible. That's why <i>The Mountain Witch</i> is a short game. A game where every character is likely to betray at least one other PC isn't going to last too long. I like to brag that the game has a 50% PC mortality rate, either by suicide or PC-PC violence. <br/><br/>(The downside to style is exactly that it won't last too long, but oh well, it's fun while it lasts.)                        </div>

That would be a worthy experiment. You could maybe follow the various members of a criminal gang or something like that.                        </div>

                            The different-characters approach reminds me of two comic book mini-series, each a dozen issues long: <i>Global Frequency</i>, about anti-/non-statist uber-tech troubleshooters for sf crises, and <i>Demo</i>, about a variety of teens and young adults picking up strange powers in various modern environments. Very cool stuff, and I haven't really thought about the model for gaming, but I bet it could work nicely if the players are all on board for the overall concept.                        </div>

I think it totally depends on the structure and focus of the game. The way character 'death' (how a character leaves play in general) and player resources are handled can make a big difference on how well playing for broke functions in long term play. <br/>
<br/>
If most of the resources are tied to the player and not character dependent, if the mechanical rewards of the game cycle around playing for broke, and if playing for broke doesn't result in the player being removed from play, I think that long term go-for-broke play will work just fine.                        </div>

                            Capes fits the bill on that one, C. Edwards -- you can totally play up your current character to the hilt and keep the resources when you switch to a new character.                        </div>

                            I'm not sure it's totally fair to call games with rotating characters or something similar the same as a "years long", "open-ended", or "endless" campaign. I think we all know what the original poster was talking about---a campaign, whether episodic or long story-arch'ed, with more or less the same charaters in more or less the same setting where the dynamics of play don't really change or change very slowly.                        </div>

                            Oh, I'm not trying to call them the same thing. I'm just trying to point out that there is not only more than one way to sustain long term play, but that there are ways to do it that capture some of the best elements of more sharply defined indie games and the traditional open-ended rpg. I also think this applies to one of the OP's questions.<br/>

                            Tim, <br/><br/>So what about generational games (like Pendragon) -- where the campaign is obviously one ongoing family epic, but the characters (and time period of the world) change? Does that count as long term? <br/><br/>I have a feeling we're getting into shades of grey territory here.                        </div>
