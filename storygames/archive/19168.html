I could've sworn I wrote something here.<br/><br/>Portland has a really nice community for Story Games. A good person to talk to would be Tayler (<a href="/forums/profile/quincunx%29">@quincunx)</a>, and you should check out the Play Out Loud page on Facebook (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/playoutloudpdx?ref=stream&amp;viewer_id=100000466578235" rel="nofollow">LINK</a>) and the Portland Gamers Meetup page (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Gamers/events/162098612/" rel="nofollow">LINK</a>) to look into Ready Set Game PDX, the regular meetup of story gamers to try cool stuff with new people. I THINK it meets every other Tuesday, and is on hiatus until February 4th (don't quote me on this schedule), and it's a great place to go if you want to meet the local scene. <br/>Similarly, that same Portland Gamers Meetup page seems like it's a great place to hook some people together if you want to set up a game of your own or get in on the ground floor.<br/><br/>If cons are more your scene, Gamestorm is happening in March just across the bridge in Vancouver, and the story-game-centric Indie Hurricane will be there. Here's a <a href="http://www.gamestorm.org/" rel="nofollow">LINK</a> to that too for good measure.<br/><br/>Hope there's something in there for ya! I'm up in Tacoma, WA, but hopefully I'll see ya one of these trips down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TallPaul" title="TallPaul"><img alt="TallPaul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/761/nEEFJAV72ZSZR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TallPaul">TallPaul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427749/#Comment_427749" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-29T00:19:15+00:00" title="January 29, 2014 12:19AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks man!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427861/#Comment_427861" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-01T01:29:18+00:00" title="February  1, 2014  1:29AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're interested, you can hit me up too.

Somewhere around the 3rd - 6th of April I guess, that bit is all a little fluid. Would live to meet up and have a game with some people if they were around. We've played with friends in Madison, WI before now, and shared a game of The Tavern with Joe during the UK trip.<br/><br/>Any gaming shops in Portland that have tables perhaps?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
