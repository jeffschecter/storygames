                    Okay, so I just dropped a comparitively small amount of cash to round out my personal Indie library, and I've come to a conclusion:<br/>
<br/>
* I would most like to buy printed books, with the PDF as an extra<br/>
* If I can't have that, I'll buy just the printed book.<br/>
* If I can't have that, I'll buy the PDF.<br/>
<br/>
Why?  Because I dig holding the book in my hand, dragging it around with me, showing it to friends, and holding something in my hand for my money.<br/>
<br/>
The PDF is nice for that semi-instant gratification thing.  I love skimming a game I just bought on the laptop while I wait for it to arrive in the mail.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the art of self-publishing an indie game is certainly trucking along, and everyone still has their own way of doing things, but here's what I like best as a purchaser, and what I want to do when I finally get over my stage fright and start seriously playtesting my games with an eye towards publication.<br/>
<br/>
Two options:<br/>
<br/>
# Hardcopy book for $20, plus the PDF for free!<br/>
# Just the PDF (possibly multiple versions) for $8-12.<br/>
<br/>
The actual figures are merely intended as typical examples.<br/>
<br/>
Call to action: what have you liked to see in your games buying, and what have been the rationale behind your offerings?                </div>

                            I have only one criterion when it comes to buying games.  It has to be something that I have definite, concrete plans to play; a date and time, and people signed up.                        </div>

<p>Judson, my order of preference is the same as yours when it comes to purchases - Book+PDF, Book Only, PDF Only.</p>
<p>When I'm thinking of buying a game I read every review of it I can find, all the actual play threads I can find, and any preview offerings the designer has on his website.  I also try to read anything the designer has posted in public forums - my impression of them affects my impression of the game.  After all that I have a pretty good idea of whether I'm going to buy it or not.</p>
<p>Lots of support on a website and helpful forums are always good.</p>
<p>Being able to play the game with only a single book (no Addendum to the Index of the Storymaster's Errata Companion Splat Supplements) is good.</p>
<p>I rarely buy "PDF Only" offerings.  To date <em>Trollbabe</em> is the only thing I've bought that was.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

                            I like to be able to buy a book. If it's something I'm not sure of, and there is a possibility of buying a PDF first, and upgrading later, then I'll consider that path. For some things, I am willing to pay twice because having a PDF is handy (for example, anything I have on PDF, I have access to at work, or even it's handily available in my office at home if someone is asking a question on a forum, or I'm trying to understand some rules discussion [I've looked at Dogs in the Vinyard a LOT in this way]).<br/>
<br/>
I wil buy games on spec, or lately, I have bought indie games because of a recommendation of how they solve some issue I'm currently looking at.<br/>
<br/>
Following Fred's method would be bad for me. How do I know I actually want to run the game until I have it in hand?<br/>

                            I'm completely willing to drop $20 on a well-spoken of game just to read it.  Hell, I bought ??Nobilis?? on the pretty clear understanding that I'd probably never get anyone to play it.<br/>
<br/>
As a designer, I think it's definitely to my advantage to be well read in terms of roleplaying games.  And about an order of magnitude more to my advantage to be "well-played."<br/>
<br/>
But games I don't know so well, I'd like to spend less and get more.  And, silly as it is "free PDF" goes a long way towards convincing me to buy a book.                        </div>

                            I have the same buying priorities (book + pdf, then just book, then just PDF).<br/>
<br/>
I'm offering Timestream in the following breakdown:<br/>
<br/>
* 8$ b&amp;w PDF<br/>
* 12$ color PDF. If you want, you get the b&amp;w PDF for free (it's nicer for ink conservation). This version is also internally bookmarked and hyperlinked, which the B&amp;W is not. Same content.<br/>
* 16$ b&amp;w, coilbound book. You get the color PDF with your purchase. I, personally, prefer coil-bound books for actual play, which is the main reason this one is offered. Same content, except differently formatted for the smaller size (6x9 instead of 8.5x11), and I think it has one less picture than the PDF.<br/>
* 26$ full-color perfectbound book. You get the color PDF with your purchase. Same content as the coil-bound.<br/>
<br/>
So far, I've sold more of 26$ than anything else, by far. Which doesn't make any sense to my economy-geared mind - but hey, I'm not complaining.<br/>
<br/>
Is that the kind of thing you're looking for?                        </div>

                            Just to add a balancing opinion:<br/><br/>Printed books are quite passÃƒÂ©. They cost more, are slow to deliver, add delivery costs, cannot be conveniently copy-pasted from etc. Conversely, a PDF is delivered more or less instantly and I can carry all my games on my phone-PDA, available whenever necessary. Printing is not a problem for me, if really necessary, but so far I think I have only printed Dogs.<br/><br/>The only indie game I bought in printed format was Polaris, and that only because it was not available otherwise, and Ben hand-delivered it to Helsinki. I recently considered finally buying the Sorcerer books, but did not because they seemed to be available in printed format only.                        </div>

                            I'm in the UK, so shipping books is expensive and takes time. So I usually buy PDFs. Also, I like the instant gratification of downloading a PDF.<br/>
<br/>
I usually buy games because they're recommended [i]somewhere[/i]: I bought My Life With Master because it was recommended in the back of Paranoia XP. Oh, yes, and I bought Dogs In The Vineyard because I played it at a convention. Both of those were PDF purchases.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I buy games from people who seem nice.<br/>

I submit that the reason you sell mostly $26 books is that the cost of indie games is not actually significant to most of the people who buy them.  It's a recreational expense, and a small one -- cheaper than a night at the movies.<br/>
<br/>
The big decision is whether or not this game is worth purchasing.  Once over that hump, spending $10-25 is pretty simple.<br/>

<p>I like to see physical books, to a certain extent. If your game is thirty pages long, dear God give me a PDF. I buy books to have artifacts, weighty and full of presence. It doesn't have to be four hundred pages of presence - PTA has enough - but it does have to be there.</p>
<p>I like them to come with PDFs at no additional charge.</p>
<p>I'll buy a hardcopy with no PDF but generally not the other way round.</p>

                            Just a point or two of data to add to this thread - creating a professional, sellable .pdf is nontrivial.  Some of this is logistical and can be factored into design, but the final product can and should look and behave a little differently from a print book.  With The Roach, for example, we intend to offer a .pdf eventually, but we're not going to do it until we can do it right, which means taking time we don't have right now to reformat and add layers.  <br/><br/>Another point about print books - Bully Pulpit Games makes slightly less on international orders per unit by keeping shipping at a flat rate, but 35% of our business thusfar has been overseas, with big responses from the UK and Germany.                        </div>

<br/>
If I've made the decision to buy the game then as long as it's not absurdly overpriced I'm gonna buy it.  Whether it's $15 or $25 dollars makes little difference.  Given this, I'll buy the "best" option as I see it.<br/>
<br/>
And for me, like most others it seems, it goes like this:<br/>

                            I don't buy physical books any more unless I'm almost certain I'm going to run them, or they're not available in PDF. PDFs are still cheaper than the book in most cases, and I end up collecting too many games to get them all in physical form.<br>
<br>
Occasionally this screws me over, when I end up wanting to run a game that I only own the PDF of (so I end up having to buy the book), but it doesn't happen very often. I'm one of those people who won't spread around the PDF file to my friends, because I know they won't delete it afterwards.                        </br></br></div>

                            Two quick and rather dull things to add. <br>
<br>
On the price thing: the price makes a big difference to me. If it's ten or fifteen dollars, that's an impulse buy. Anything over that and I start thinking about whether I'll actually play the game, etc, etc, and end up not buying it.<br>
<br>
On the PDF thing: I generally buy PDFs and then print them. I don't read them on screen.<br>

                            I like to have a book. But the high delivery costs made me decide to buy better PDFs if possible. <br/>
<br/>
The shipping costs from EEUU to Spain may easily be up to 10$, increasing the cost of the game a lot. Buying several books at the same time reduce the shipping costs per unit with most retailers, but this is not my typical buying pattern.<br/>
<br/>
I tried also to buy from Great Britain's retailers to save shipping costs, but typically the retailer has moved her extra costs to the price. The final price is similar as buying from EEUU.<br/>
<br/>
I'm printing my PDFs most of the times, cutting the sheets to the proper book size, and bounding them with a coil. Sometimes I even print the cover in color laserjet printer. The result is quite nice.                        </div>
