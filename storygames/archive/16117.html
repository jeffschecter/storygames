Turn your faces upward and drink of me.<br/><br/>GLAMOUR RAGE: WHAT PRICE A BFF? play report, by the incomparable SCRAP "cheekbones that could cut a man in half" PRINCESS:<br/>Some slight tech issues at the start meant that +Mike Fernandez had trouble connecting and we just ploughed ahed leaving him behind. A 1000 pardons for that.<br/>Also , the Wise and Terrible +Jez Gordon bowed out his seat to let someone else play. Truly Chivalry is another jewel in his crown.<br/>Final play roster was +Zak Smith +Tiffany Simmons +Tina Rowand +Jenn Parnell and +Reynaldo Madrinan .<br/>Who was playing:<br/>blood sucking totally not a robot with useful devices, Magic Girl with force blasts, also?Not a robot with SCIENCE, Nyanpire kitty cat, and a great beautiful beast of a badass brawler school girl. Who remember that she could fly like half way through the episode.<br/>Interesting that Tainted Blood was chosen by 3 people, Blood sucker by 2 people, Monofliment whip (okay that's not so weird) and secret android by 2 people.<br/>THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN<br/>5 is heaps of people. Next time I wanna try with 3 or 4, but probs gonna have run a few different games in order for there to be JUSTICE . I'll write up my thoughts as DUNGEON MISTRESS about this all later, for now enjoy the show:<br/><br/>Our episode starts on sparse subway train, hurtling through the glistening titled tubes of City. Suddenly! Spooky flashing light and near the entire train is frozen in time! Except 5 special individuals! WHo are the player characters! Wow! What a twist! What drunken car of fate has chosen these people to be untouched by the powers of the TREPANNER,a steampunk visionary , determined to let the light into peoples lives?<br/>A FIGHT SCENE!<br/>The trepanner armed with straps , copper, goggles, a frictionator, zaps and weaves, evading the VIOLENCE under the seats of the train, Monofliment whips , grannys as improvised clubs and blood sucking cats SEEK HIM OUT but he is evasive! A BYSTANDER frozen is CUT IN HALF like SOFT MOTHERFUCKING CHEESE by a stray monofliment whip and becomes CRISMON INTERIOR DECORATING . TIna you cold cold cold SCIENCE BASTARD. But ! The tide turns againest the TREPPANER and the Bruteiful school girl grasps him with her dainty paw and casts him out the window!<br/>His time stopping back malfunctions! A grenade is thrown! Is there time to disable it with science? No! But the steam powered grenade is knocked away before CARNAGE HAPPENS. The subtrain, still IMMOTILE in time, now has a great and terrible gash. OUT SWOOPS THE BRUTE and BEATS THE TREPPANERS HEAD IN. BEATS IT IN LIKE A RIPE MELON FULL OF BRAIN AGAINST PRISTINE SUBWAY TILES! IS THIS SYMBOLIC OF THE MODERN CONDITION? SHIT WHY NOT! Time resumes! Distress and blood! Trampling and cats bandaging head injurys! Cute BUT wrong!<br/><br/>The party disperses! To meet up at the big video screen in the city square, according to the tickertape instructions via Zaks TOTALLY NOT A ROBOT STOP LOOKING AT ME FLESHY character. For DAMAGE has been done to the TIMEMEAT and this disparate group wishes to address this with A CAPER.<br/>Reynaldo (NOTE TO SELF WRITE DOWN CHARACTERS NAMES) swishy muscle stacked dame adorns herself for this dream date. People start getting their shit together. WHAT HAS TIME WOUNDED WROUGHT?<br/>Why its a frigging TREX! How do you like them BEANS? Firebreathing? COZ TREXS DO THAT WHO THE FRIG KNEW???<br/>Another fight is had. Destruction is spewed like so much waddery. The trex, ancient king of more grandiose age is de-ankled, force hammered and small blue taxi-clubbed back into oblivion! A wonder of NATURES DRUG ABUSE sleeps once more. Farewell sweet scaley prince, this age is too small for your beauty.<br/><br/>TINAs ROBOT takes a SAMPLE of BLOOD, the robot provides internal devices, she provides the knowledge to use said devices JOKES ABOUT PAST RELATIONSHIPS AND INSERTIONS ARE HAD . Both robots are metric! Science in a dark dirty alley is had!<br/>SOme words I fail to pronounce describe the finger print of scientific buggery that has let to this. A plan is made to trace this and stop further TIMEHOLES happening. THE local astronomy lab, radio tower and hard-on collider are suggest as tools to detect the CHRONOCRAZYNESS. THe astronomy lab is chosen! Public transport is taken, the lead scientist DR SCHEINDER is happy to help. An secret motive is not suspected , and the party is lead into a lab, only to discover the equipment only disperses FOOD PELLETS and OUCHYS OF ELECTRICITY . WHat the shit?<br/>WHAT THE SHIT? It is discover that they were shrunk and teleported into box, a skinnerian box! To be tested in the most dumbdumb of stimulus response school of BRAINQUACKERY. An escape is had, due to to monofliliment whips, a shrinky door modified . TO EMBIGGIN. Instructions are not followed cleary by A MAGIC GIRL and Zaks character is DISSAPPEAREDANATED. The rest of the party makes it through, the shrinky door makes them big, then catches fire, the sprinkler system is activated with VIOLENCE. Everyone leaves the building in an orderly fashion. THE ASTRONOMY LAB THEN IMPLODES. Holy balls!<br/>The party regards its work. The strongest school girl in the world declares "fuck it, science went wrong, we foiled some science, maybe not the science we made go wrong but whatever" (I paraphrase here) and FLYS OFF INTO THE SUNSET. The credits roll, and the camera pans to reveal Pteradons now gliding majestic above CITYs skyline. A certain not-a-robot telefrags one and falls into the sea, to wash up on the beach. Trilobites adorn him, a child pokes him with a toy shovel and we fade to black.<br/><br/>THIS IS WHAT IT MEANT TO MEEEE<br/><br/>So now you read the play report, here is the dry and academic thoughts as Dungeon Mistress about the first ever THE STARS BURN IN OUR EYES:Frilled warrior saga game on g+<br/>Also this post has some behind the wizards curtain secrets of the dm stuff so if you don't wanna have your child like wonder ruined may do not read on.<br/>5 is a lot of people for this kind of game. It's not unmanageable but shapes the game into far more of a sugar high. Also coz Tina had a non-moving avatar face I forgot about her in combat a couple of times. Dang Soz +Tina Rowand Also my notes for the game were maybe 5 lines of text (treppanner steampunk dude freezing people in subway, t-rex, albino alligators, flamingo hatchet gang, transformer ghost train guardian I think was it in it's entirety ) and a rough stat block for these. Which is totally my homeplane but maybe did not have enough left over concentration to keep track of how some of the less experienced players were going . +Jenn Parnell how did you find it? Thought maybe you were unsure of what your character could do in combat , and would of liked to give you some pointers but was juggling far too much chaos.<br/>Sweet sweet Chaos.<br/>My rule of thumb for this game was that if it was animated as a tv show would it be awesome to watch? This session was a total success in that regard I do believe.<br/>One thing I wanna experiment with is the dither factor.<br/>Dither is the bits were the characters are scheming , reacting, fucking around and procrastinating. Which is very fertile ground for fun, and figured in this kind of game that these bits were a good chance to ground the characters in the enviroment.<br/>Now in g+ it seems, it's not really that great for characters to start off in conversations and arguments in twos and threes. You either are addressing everyone or your not talking. So I did not want stuff to go on too much with just a couple of people directing the Dither. Felt people might get bored who were not getting involved. If it was face to face I would have a better feel for it, but g+ is its own animal.<br/>And I'm a g.m who has a habit of throwing something through the window on fire or going time skip your are all over here now because it was getting boring. But maybe need to let dithering around and treading water happen more?<br/>Because I'm all curious about how to go about encouraging a sense of a reactive real world environment . While still have it be violently derailed by near cartoon mayhem and surrealist horror. So figured the more characters get a chance to shoot the breeze in character, say oh Imma going shopping, I wanna check on my moms, I'm late for school now etc the more it will feel like a real world. <br/>ANyway see how a game goes with 2 or 3 people with more dither. Maybe it play the same, that's cool, fun was had by everyone. Huzzah. Also gonna stat up some Random consquence tables with swat teams , cops , buildings on fire, gangs defending territory, stray toxic waste truck that I can roll on when the characters start forgetting that they are in a crowded city and not a dungeon. Also really want to see what play is like in closed enviroment like a cruise ship or building stolen by mole people. So actually like a dungeon.<br/>Think maybe there will be games played with a regulars that are more meandering and then all in games with 4-6 people with a lot more "okay so theres this and this and this happening, whadda guys doing? Okay you are all going here? Bam , you's are all here, you see cat people with a fire truck. The fire truck appears to be filled full of liquid nitrogen which they are hosing everything down with. "<br/>Viva la Fun and Player Agency!<br/><br/>POST POST EDIT:<br/>Also? I really loved Reynaldos call from his character that was "ah fuck it, we fought science going wrong, maybe a completely unrelated science going wrong, but whatever "<br/>I wanted to wrap up the game with maybe it to be continued later, but I loved the not-really-closure ending of it. It would of made a great ending if it was a real episode. IT was perfect for the style I wanted. A complete derail , a non-sequential lets just walk away from this, and now City has Pteradons and trilobites.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367436/#Comment_367436" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T06:50:05+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  6:50AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Best play report I've ever read?

Sigh.<br/><br/>I've been updating the original post <a href="http://monstermanualsewnfrompants.blogspot.com.au/2012/03/girl-alone-and-killingbringing-pretty.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://monstermanualsewnfrompants.blogspot.com.au/2012/03/girl-alone-and-killingbringing-pretty.html</a> here, with some BigBlack lyrics and clarifications and padding and stuff. I wrote a couple of character options that allow you to get more exp if you choose them, and you character messes up plans, makes cool plans, or steal peoples lovers , depending on what option you choose. I thought this is a good idea, because its opt in (and say forcing characters to pick a motivation seems like it will create token oh I need to do this for exp and not because I got excited about my character doing it) and not too meta.<br/>Check the Chasers section in that link to see what the hump I am talking about.<br/><br/>Really wanna try the escalation/deescalation point mentioned by Nicodemus (spelling?) but I wanted them to only be used if your character was out of scene. But in g+ I did not feel comfortable not keeping everyone in scene all the time, because it's harder to read peoples moods for feeling left out or bored.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
