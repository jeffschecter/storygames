Flipping through a game book, I found some interesting "meta-gaming tricks" to close the gap between character paranoia and player paranoia.<br/><br/>Unnecessary Spot Checks - The first hour or two (actual game time) the characters spend in the Big Bad's realm, have them make frequent spot checks but describe nothing unusual no matter how good they roll. A <i>really</i> good roll could earn a simple "You notice your shoe is untied."<br/><br/>Black Dice - When the characters enter the Big Bad's realm, hand them a black die and say "Whenever you roll, please use this die before your own." When the characters reach the outskirts of the Big Bad's lair, hand them another black die "Whenever you roll, please use both of these dice before any of your own." When they enter the Big Bad's lair, pass out a final black die. These dice, of course, mean nothing. :-P<br/><br/>These tricks are simple and the Spot Check deal has been around forever, but you get the point. By adding some interesting mechanical tweaks you can foster the same paranoia and/or suspicion in the players that their characters are feeling in the game. I find this fascinating!<br/><br/>I'm curious to see if any of you know any other methods for using mechanics to influence the moods of actual players. Have you seen anything like this in other games? I'm sure there are more neat tricks out there!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213697/#Comment_213697" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T06:18:54+00:00" title="June 21, 2009  6:18AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My tip is to actually ignore mechanics.<br/>My most successful horror game to date was the one where I just stopped caring about rules once the players reached the final showdown.

Why not use these rolls to add all sorts of subtle color that starts to ratchet the tension up? Maybe they see a rat scurry into a hole. Or the corpse of a dead dog. Or a sound of water dripping from a faucet. Or whatever. Images are powerful and evocative. Repetitive spot checks with hidden results only the GM knows just start making me annoyed.<br/><br/>I am also not very impressed with the please roll meaningless black dice trick for much the same reasons.

I think Paranoia can get away with that stuff precisely *because* it's such a cheesy, blatantly manipulative thing to do: every dirty trick is encouraged and expected.  When I sit down to play Paranoia, I'm signing on for exactly that.<br/><br/>But like you, in other games I'm not so much a fan of it.  And really, I'm not entirely convinced that getting player emotion to match character emotion is that great in the first place.  (Then again, I get enough of an emotional workout at my job...perhaps if I had a more stress-free career, I'd be jonesing to get a little vicarious stress in during my leisure time.)  To be honest, in most games I'm happiest when everyone is having fun, whatever that entails.  For our group, that's generally accomplished by keeping a little distance between the character and the player when things get bad, because none of us need to be personally angry or sad or afraid in order to play a character with those emotions, or to appreciate and be satisfied by playing a character with those emotions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213746/#Comment_213746" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T13:40:57+00:00" title="June 21, 2009  1:40PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2009 1:42PM by Jarvis.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you all for input! On reading your comments, I do agree with most of you. I've used the Black Dice bit in the past and had some luck with it. I think the key is not to use it for too long. Any mechanical twist is only effective while it remains new. <br/><br/>The fun thing about the Black Dice is the players roll them when their characters enter The Forbidden Zone, but you never tell them why. The dice are different and new, but not understood just as their characters would feel the Zone was different but in an undefinable way. The dice aren't truly meaningless, since their purpose is to be subtly different. The key is to <i>never</i> tell the characters what the dice do or don't mean, not even after the game!<br/><br/>The Jenga tower is exactly what I'm talking about. I've played Dread a handful of times and can't believe I didn't think to include that in the example.<br/><br/>What about non-mechanical tricks then?<br/><br/>I just started John Wick's <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16267" rel="nofollow">Play Dirty</a> and he listed a great trick for Vampire:<br/><br/><b>Infected Blood Points</b> - A blood born disease has entered the city that only affects vampires. Humans are just carriers and there's no way to tell a human is infected until your vampire feeds from it. Wick started handing out Hershey Kisses for every blood point the characters drained from humans. Once the characters caught rumors of infected humans, a few Kisses with almonds were secretly mixed into the bunch. The draw for Kisses was random, but once the first player crunched into an almond he knew something had gone terribly wrong.<br/><br/>Whether or not this is a "mechanical" trick is open for interpretation, but it still serves an excellent example. Are there any more of these we're missing out on?!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213754/#Comment_213754" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T15:13:02+00:00" title="June 21, 2009  3:13PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've used something like the Black Dice, with the difference that dice did actually mean something (a chance that the characters where absorbing some kind of spiritual contamination, it was effectively marking those who would be attacked first by the monsters in that adventure).

Perhaps they could be used to up the tension-level of the characters, making them more prone to faulty actions when the really BAD stuff hits 'em?<br/><br/>Other:<br/><br/>--- Vary rhythm to make players on edge; really sloooow, BURST OF ACTION, really sloooow ...<br/><br/>--- Let them be followed by a shadow, really hard to catch; a harmless wreck of a soul, a victim, but with blabbering awe of their opponent. There is nothing like a pitiful NPC to make the characters build tense relationships with the antagonist.<br/><br/>--- Make absurd and/or sick statements, as thoughts popping into the characters heads. Delivers the players into strange landscapes, where logic and sense will fail you ...<br/><br/>--- Before play: make players write down, in secret, a childhood memory of their character, something that really frightened and/or hurt them, and use it in scenario. This is best if you just use it with no reference to the player, and let him recognize his thing by himself (or not).<br/><br/>--- When delivering general info on situation, fix one player with a heavy stare, as if you say this to him, specifically. "Grow" while you do it: stand up little by little, leaning over him, widening your arms (this "growing" will be threatening to him). When info is given, just release him. Do not explain.<br/><br/>--- Make ominous movements with your arms, suddenly and jerkingly standing up, lifting the arms over your head, and then POINTING at one player, declaring:<i> It is YOUR destiny to open this door! </i> (comic relief, or a bit scary, depends on the players)<br/><br/>--- Induce a character with the sudden memory of love/beauty; a wondrous kiss, a smile from your mother, a beautiful landscape-painting, etc.  (creates contrast, and may have the players suspect that they stand to loose something precious).<br/><br/>--- Make players experience infuriating impotence; maimed kittens, children, women, men, begging for help, and clearly beyond any help the characters may give. BE the figure they meet, go down on your knees and take the hands of the players (or cling to their trouser-legs and/or shirt-sleeves), let spittle leak, shake your head, drag your legs, beg them desperately for help (and at the same time describing in horrid detail how maimed the figure is).

And many of the people they interact with have scars in their faces. Of course, some of this will be important -- the ravens are actually spies of the Big Bad, or somesuch.

If the secret doesn't fit with the game, players, and/or characters -- it involves characters they don't like or are bored by, it doesn't engage anyone on an emotional or intellectual level, it is obviously irrelevant to their goals or to the dilemmas facing them -- then it will be immediately recognized as a waste of time and ignored forever.  So using secrets requires just as much attention to what your groups' buttons are as anything else.<br/><br/>Case in point: once upon a time, I played in an oWoD Vampire game.  The GM was really amped up about vampire origin mythology, and had NPCs with strongly-held opinions about them and a burning desire to have the characters discover the secret history of vampirism.  He kept pushing it at us, over and over again.  The problem was, none of the PCs had any vested interest in knowing how vampires came to be; we had all built characters with personal and political agendas that could not be furthered by gathering any information about Caine or Lilith or the Book of Nod or any of that stuff.  The characters had no reason to care...and as players, even though we were aware that there were secrets there to be investigated, we didn't personally care about the secret, either.  One the one hand, it was clearly a case of poor communication: he'd stressed the personal and political angles of the setting heavily during his pitch and never once mentioned that the Big Secret of how vampires came to be was going to be majorly important to the game he wanted to run.  So, no surprise that the characters ended up not caring about any of that, right?  But then again, once we realized that was where he wanted to go, it turned out that <i>as players</i> we didn't care about it, either, otherwise we would've adjusted our characters so that they'd be interested in it.  We wanted to dance with the girl who brung us and do cool political and personal stuff, and as far as we were concerned the Big Secret could stay a secret forever.  Our buttons could not be pushed by that story, and so it flopped.<br/><br/><br/>The other caveat to secrets is that they've got a limited shelf life.  You can't keep a secret forever and expect it to stay interesting -- everyone's got a threshold, a point at which they think "What's the point of pursuing this if I'm never going to get an answer?", and you have to spill it before then or it'll not only ruin their interest in <i>that</i> secret, but in any other secrets you might introduce later on.  (Once they've identified you as someone who'll just keep yanking their chain and never deliver any payoff for it, they'll stop paying attention to you.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Having a timer at the table while the characters are "racing against the clock" works marvelously as well, but especially if the timer signifies some real life reward or punishment. <br/><br/>Timer - In a sci-fi game the characters are trying to hold their busted ship together long enough for the rescue vessel to arrive. When the timer goes off, the rescue ship arrives and the players get real life cookies or some such. Silly, but you can see my point.<br/><br/>Incentive - Imagine awarding the actual player a candy, a cookie, or even a dollar each time their characters get praise for a mission well done. Or even better, every time their character visited that cute girl at the bar. The player wants to visit that girl just like his character wants that emotional high from flirting with her. Of course, the girl could easily be toying with him and secretly manipulating him just as the GM is doing with the incentive. How many players would fall for it though? I'd guess a bunch!<br/><br/>Any other ideas?<br/><br/>I'm not saying any of this stuff should be worked into a game, but I'm finding myself very intrigued by blurring the player/character line lately. As a player, I get scared for my character when he's in danger and I get hopeful when he's got a chance to win the girl. In both cases though, I'm only scared and hopeful FOR instead of scared and hopeful WITH. I think Dread's use of Jenga does a good job of promoting the WITH. I'm curious to find other ways to do it for a wide variety of emotions and circumstances.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214138/#Comment_214138" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-23T23:25:41+00:00" title="June 23, 2009 11:25PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            * Uncompromising character death. Your character can die quite easily and you can't prevent it except by not getting into those kinds of situations. Upside: When your character's life is in danger you're gonna be sweating, since a character is a work of love and you put a lot of time into it. Risking to lose it all will get you worried, just like your character is. Downside: players might be too afraid to take chances, leading to a boring game. Also, people can get really angry and frustrated or just don't wanna play your game. This can be mediated by not promoting investment in the character, but then the upside goes away, as well.<br/><br/>* Making the mechanics work similarly to the fictional events. You don't just roll a die to see what happens. If you're hacking a security system, you as a player is solving a puzzle, with mistakes tallying up and maybe a time limit, too. If you're feinting in combat, you're actually trying to fool the player, not just the character, into thinking you're going to attack low and then attack high instead. If you're sneaking past a dangerous monster, the Jenga tower is excellent.<br/><br/>* And then there's of course the deep immersion route. No OOC talk, no visible mechanics, and so on. But then you might as well be LARPing, if you ask me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I'm not talking about addressing the players personally.<br/><br/>Rather, everyone has certain issues and themes that they just respond to. For example, some people are scared by gore &amp; violence, while some others are scared by psychological horror. As the GM, you have to figure out what will trigger the player's emotions. Logically, a giant half-rotted zombie umberhulk should scare the crap out of any character if they were real. But if the player is a psychological horror kind of guy, he may just sit back and yawn. But start describing dark shadows and almost imperceptible whispers, and that same player might get all wide-eyed and quiet.<br/><br/>That's what I'm talking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E" title="E"><img alt="E" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E">E</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214266/#Comment_214266" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-24T18:56:09+00:00" title="June 24, 2009  6:56PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that I am scared as a player when I want to be scared. <br/>\nBeing scared is more a player job then a game master job. <br/>\nThe question should maybe be more something like "as a group of players, what can we do to be scared?" <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that useless secrets rolls are really annoying.<br/>\nMechanic tricks could maybe work on me if they are part of the gameplay that I want to experience and if I know that the game master is playing by the rules and that each dice roll is merciless and that my character can really be removed from the game (character dead need to be fonctionnal and wished for).  <br/>\nBut if I feel that the GM use fiat to save our character for later it can get really annoying like useless secrets rolls.<br/>\nIn that case, I prefer that we use a different technique to build tension.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

The more we can connect with our characters, the more their emotions become ours and vice versa. How do you make this happen?<br/><br/>Encourage player investment in the character. Investment is created by a combination of time/effort (longer and more involved chargen), creative input (make the player invent the character details), and sympathy/empathy (bring issues the player cares about into the character).<br/><br/>Eliminate aspects of the game that destroy verisimilitude and flow. Anything that breaks the player-character connection and makes the player think "that isn't right" will cause the player to draw back from the character.
