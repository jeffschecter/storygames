It can be caught by means of a single exposure to a single source, but multiple sources and exposures 'help'.<br/><br/>Contrariwise, many social phenomena are "complex contagions".  To catch one requires exposure to multiple *sources*.  Multiple exposures help, but multiple sources are the key.<br/><br/>Cool?<br/><br/>Okay.<br/><br/>So, I say to you that the act of gaming <i>primarily</i> acts as a complex contagion, while the act of selling games is treated (as are almost all things in the market) as a simple contagion.

I can individually make the decision to eat chocolate or buy lip gloss (I prefer CoverGirl Wetslicks, btw). I can even individually make the decision to buy a game. But I really can't individually make the decision to <i>play</i> that game. I need others to be "infected" that agree to play with me.<br/><br/>As for the assertion that, to infect those others, there <i>must</i> be an additional source, I'm not so sure. They could easily be infected by me. (Unless, the source that infected me is considered one source for the players and I am another, but that's not what I think "multiple sources" means. I assume the "multiple source" idea is that the players must get infected by both me and something else.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280922/#Comment_280922" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-15T12:04:18+00:00" title="July 15, 2010 12:04PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wordman</cite> I assume the "multiple source" idea is that the players must get infected by both me and something else.)</blockquote>\nYes, and no.  The idea is that most people would require multiple sources.   Everyone has a different threshold - how many of your friends need to ask you to come out to a basketball game before you give it a go?<br/><br/>I say that almost all current gamers are the people with low thresholds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280928/#Comment_280928" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-15T12:20:28+00:00" title="July 15, 2010 12:20PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to imply that games have a network value, which depends on, say, the number of players squared, rather than merely the number of players.<br/><br/>It may also imply that the best possible thing that can happen to your game is to have some kid cite it as the reason he went crazy and murdered a bunch of people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
