How would I go about making a Tabletop RPG? No doubt there something in Japanese but how do I do it in English. Of course just about first time for her.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434035/#Comment_434035" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-18T14:47:19+00:00" title="June 18, 2014  2:47PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would go for something like <a href="http://danielsolisblog.blogspot.it/2009/08/happy-birthday-robot.html" rel="nofollow">Happy Birthday Robot</a>, maybe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434036/#Comment_434036" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-18T14:55:02+00:00" title="June 18, 2014  2:55PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I...don't have anything to add to that.

Basically, I designed ultra-lite games to help folks learn English.<br/><br/>The main requirement is that the games -- scenarios, situations, whatever -- <i>require</i> communication. Design it so that players have information that each other needs. Design it so that goals can't be accomplished without talking in English.<br/><br/>Since she's eight, it'll be good to include a lot of imagination. Have her describe her character's abilities (good chance to practice synonyms), powers, etc. Have her describe the game world. Give her free rein to create situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" title="Kayfall"><img alt="Kayfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">Kayfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434315/#Comment_434315" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T21:55:14+00:00" title="June 24, 2014  9:55PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use role-playing to teach English here in China every week, and Jiawen is right. The really great thing about this method of teaching is that it focuses the process of learning English around the real goal of communicating with each other, without any of the tiresome sort of fake communication that usually goes with teaching a language (where you ask a question just because you want the student to practice the sentence structure involved in answering, not because you really want to know). In a game, you ask a question and the student really wants to know what you mean, so when you explain any new words to her, she's really listening; and then once she understands, she really wants to communicate her answer to you, even if she doesn't really know how to say this or that. It's a much more natural form of language learning.<br/><br/>The key is simplifying the rules so that the complicated things you see in most games don't get in the way, and working the vocabulary you want to teach. My own game has characters going into the Dreamworld for adventures, befriending monsters there, and using that friendship to overcome challenges and often fight other monsters. If I need to teach about Polygons for instance, I explain to the students that there's a dangerous creature called a "Polygonster" that they need to know how to defend themselves against! It is basically an magic drawing, with 2-dimensions ("what's a 'dimension'?" they ask), and at least 3 sides, and it must be a closed figure. It can eat 3-dimensional objects (like you!) of course, and in fighting it students quickly realize that if you can make a break in its shape, then that will break its magic also. They need to know the features of a polygon so that they can defend themselves, and they need to talk about it with you so that they can actually defeat the thing. It's a great chance for them to use an eraser or scissors as weapons of awesome power, and it's a great way to learn some English geometry words too!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
