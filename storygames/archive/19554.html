It's been a while!<br/>So, remember this thread <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/12047/dd-for-kids-the-wildlings-intro-game/p1" rel="nofollow">over here?</a><br/><br/>After a few years of tinkering, testing, revising, playing, breaking things, and playing some more, <b>The Wildlings</b> game is inching closer to an actual release...probably via Kickstarter!<br/><img alt="image" src="http://i452.photobucket.com/albums/qq249/100percentotaku/WildlingsFDCDupdatedtestscreen_zpsb6f3ad80.jpg" width="400"/><br/>Originally designed by <a href="/forums/profile/JohnHarper">@JohnHarper</a>, this current incarnation has been played a few times, notably at Nemocon and recently at GoPlay NW this last weekend. I'm pretty confident that, mechanically, it should work just fine, and my only concern at this point is how well other people can play it without me sitting behind them to answer questions. Not an easy thing to do, especially since it was originally intended for introducing kids to gaming.<br/><br/>So, for the next two months, I'm asking for anyone who is interested to download the files below and play them, break them, critique them, tear them apart, and then send me feedback at gremlinlegions@hotmail.com. If you have particularly memorable APs you want to post, go right ahead! I want to read them! If you know other people who might be interested, but aren't on Story Games, send them a link. At the end of August, I'll be taking a look at all the feedback that's come in, and using that to evaluate what might need to change, what needs further editing, and whether there needs to be another round of playtesting.<br/><br/>In the meantime, let me know if there are any questions!<br/><br/>-Mike<br/>(a.k.a. Gremlin Legions, a.k.a. StupidGremlin)<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/><br/><i>Looks like some people have trouble downloading from Mediafire, so I'm including links to the files on my Google Drive.</i><br/>Mediafire Links<br/><a href="https://www.mediafire.com/folder/2xms5mktmog4yzs,fk8202zpwxbg0q8/shared\ufeff" rel="nofollow">Game File and Map</a><br/><br/>Google Drive Links<br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5K_Bqfr0dqcZFQ5UnRWOWtYNW8/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Game File</a><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5K_Bqfr0dqcVmhBclhrMUdqLUk/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Game Map</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434657/#Comment_434657" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-01T15:20:21+00:00" title="July  1, 2014  3:20PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With the kindly permission of Gremlin Mike and JH, I uploaded the previous version of the rules to G+ and played an online game with my 11-year-old daughter a couple weeks ago.

Everyone enjoyed it quite a bit. I ran it with a few experienced roleplayers in their late 20s or older, plus one 18-year-old. I have run a couple older versions of the game as well. Here's some of our feedback:<br/>Regarding question <b>2</b>: "Sturdily" is a little awkward, although I did use it as a Risk to cross a freezing cold river. In some cases it's similar to Fiercely (like the synonyms you provide, "powerfully" and "mightily"). Maybe more useful as something like Ruggedly, Hardily, or Steadfastly?<br/><b>3</b>: Players earning marks - actually the first real challenge was getting across this cold river, and three players in a row went for a mark trying to help each other cross or pull someone out of the river, and each failed! It was something to see. After that, the players were a little more hesitant, but did seem to go for marks when they had an opportunity.<br/><b>4</b>: I did introduce a companion, an independent miner they met up with who knew about trolls living in the mountains. (They suspected trolls had taken Rylka.) Actually they didn't call on him much, but I think the rules for his help worked well.<br/><b>5</b>: We didn't get through the whole adventure and I didn't use all the Ranks I had available, so I can't speak to them. I think they were a decent tool for pacing individual encounters though. I found it hard to really challenge the players by description alone, as mechanically they could deal with anything quite easily. However I think I personally need to get better at using the tags and bringing the challenge, and striking at them with multiple Risks. I also think I failed to really discuss each action with the players and talk about goals and consequences ahead of time. It seems to me there's some vagueness about describing things before the roll or after the roll (which seems intentional since you pick one feat before and additional feats after). I guess I could use even more guidance as the Guide. Like "no really, don't even touch the dice until you lay down a clear goal and several Risks!" Contrast this to Apocalypse World style or other traditional games where they roll immediately when they declare an action.<br/><b>7</b>: We had a lot of ideas for alternate settings! We're in southern Arizona, so a desert setting was the first thing to come to mind, with spirits like Coyote, Mountain Lion, and Javelina. Another thought was using Greek-style Gods in place of Spirits. Other ideas I jotted down: Undead/Ravenloft, Sci-fi, John Carter planets for Spirits, Gladiator or Battle Royale setting.<br/>For additional content, you could have more adventure ideas like the village Seer needs a particular creature's magical feather. A bigger or specific map (though personally I like the blanks). Someone suggested examples of characters and conflicts.<br/><br/><b>In general</b>: There are enough mechanics to keep the game surprising, but they are few enough that they don't get cumbersome. One player questioned the purpose of Feats. They don't restrict what you can do and don't help you describe what is happening. (Maybe I should have required more Feats as Risks in addition to fiction?) And it seems it's not hard to work in any given Feat to a description of what you want to do. Perhaps there could be some incentive to use a variety of Feats, like if you use each of them over the course of the adventure.<br/><br/>Maybe there should be some use for Bonds as well. Gaining Marks or giving +1 to teamwork?<br/><br/>One player wanted more emphasis on magic/the supernatural. There was a bit of discussion about this, and I figure it's left implicit in the text so each group can decide how much obvious supernatural stuff they want in their game. One suggestion was people with strong Owl spirit could have better eyesight, and similar boons for other spirits, but I figure when you start using more Marks you can describe it like that if you want.<br/><br/>Overall it was a fun session, with very interesting characters and setting. The challenges and combat were overcome quite descriptively, even if it wasn't very difficult (again, probably my fault). Personally I'd love to play the game as a player and try to use the system more.

Some of what you mention mirrors some of the other responses I've received. And some of the alternate settings you suggest catch my eye...though it means I might need to bone up on my desert animals (what is a Javelina?) and John Carter reading.<br/><br/>As for the Feats, the important part of choosing them is in describing <i>how</i> the Wildling does something, so that the Guide knows how to respond to the action itself. Just because a Wildling succeeds, it doesn't mean they have full narrative authority to describe the success however they want - the Feats are a fictional limiting factor in how they weave their story. If they sneak across a rope bridge <b>Secretly</b>, obviously the Guide wouldn't be able to say that some bandits heard the creaking of the wood planks, but maybe because they didn't do it <b>Carefully</b>, the swaying bridge causes someone to lose an important item, or loosens the ropes making it treacherous for their return trip. They are a way of helping the players drive which direction the story goes, trying to make sure that whatever <i>does</i> happen next, because of how they performed their actions, they'd be better able to confront it...at least fictionally. And yeah, putting those Risks in there is what makes it challenging for them, since each Risk can use up valuable Feats, and is potentially something bad that could happen to them.<br/><br/>I'm really excited to put together the revisions!
