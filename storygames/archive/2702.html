The players are not "immersed" in the same way as they are in a roleplaying game, and games of Magic do not create a story in the same way that a wargame can. James describes the appeal of these games as more mechanical, more strategic:<br/><br/>"In Magic for me there is no imagination involved. The imagining and aesthetic appeal is almost not there at all. The pictures on the card have some aesthetic appeal. Magic to me seems like Chess - it's an abstract game. As far as the imagination goes it's not at all bad - it's more strategic in a lot of ways."</blockquote>\nWhich is consistent with my own observations. While there's some backstory about how the players are taking the roles of great wizards or whatever, <i>Magic</i> players don't seem to get into any sort of character and don't seem to worry much whether the imaginary events "described" by the gameplay jibes with the imagination of the other players, or delight in what kinds of fantastic brawl might be occurring when a Serra Angel takes out a Kird Ape. It's just a card game, with some cool color.<br/><br/><i>Except...</i> I've noticed, as a spectator, players of the <i>Legends of the Five Rings</i> CCG actually <i>do</i> seem to get into this sort of thing. For example, I once saw a guy play his cards, and then follow up with some comments about "So I hit him, like <i>this</i>," with an accompanying sword-smack pantomime. Suggesting... he actually cares about everyone being on the same page in the fiction they're creating. That looks a lot like shared imagined space in a "proper" role-playing game.<br/><br/>So that's... curious. I want to know more. I don't really have much first-hand experience with this. (I can't stomach the "buying=winning" aspect of CCGs; I "cashed out" of <i>Magic</i> pretty early on.) What's going on here? Could anyone who plays these games clue me in?<br/><br/>I'm more interested in just gathering play anecdotes and less interested in analysis, at least for this thread.<br/><br/><br/>*Which everyone should read, because it's a great jumping off point for lots of different conversations.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61866/#Comment_61866" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-22T16:42:27+00:00" title="March 22, 2007  4:42PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not a CCG, but<a href="http://www.costik.com/nowords.html#Color" rel="nofollow">Greg Costikiyan talks about something similar regarding "color" in <i>Axis &amp; Allies</i></a>:\n<blockquote>Color counts for a lot: as a simulation of World War II, Lawrence Harris's Axis &amp; Allies is a pathetic effort. Ah, but the color! Millions of little plastic airplanes and battleships and tanks! Thundering dice! The world at war! The game works almost solely because of its color...[snippage] Pageantry and detail and sense of place can greatly add to a game's emotional appeal. <br/><br/>This has almost nothing to do with the game qua game; the original Nova edition of Axis &amp; Allies was virtually identical to the Milton Bradley edition.

There's nothing in the rules that isn't linked directly to the game mechanics, unlike a roleplaying game.  Magic has a lot more in common with Milles Bourne than it does D&amp;D.<br/><br/>And I would debate that a wargame creates a story.  If a story exists, it's usually because the players are familiar with the history of the scenario being played, or at least the history of the units involved.  So it's easy to extrapolate a story based on what is already known.  \n<blockquote>"In Magic for me there is no imagination involved. The imagining and aesthetic appeal is almost not there at all. The pictures on the card have some aesthetic appeal. Magic to me seems like Chess - it's an abstract game. As far as the imagination goes it's not at all bad - it's more strategic in a lot of ways."</blockquote>\nThere's no question about that.  The beautiful paintings and card designs are purely aesthetic.  But a common was still a common and a rare was worth much more.  And that's what mattered to most players.\n<blockquote>In Magic, an empahsis towards competitive play developed relatively early on.

I played a lot with friends in the coffeeshop set and met some cool new people to play or trade with.  I never once played in a tournament and never played Magic for ante (the equivalent of racing for pink slips).  But when I moved to the Bay Area and fell in with a new group of players, they had bought all of the cards that I ever dreamed of owning and were always trying to get me into sealed deck tournaments and all that.  And within a year, I pretty much was done with the hobby and got rid of my collection.<br/><br/>But yeah, I followed the card values in Scrye very closely because they affected the trading value of my cards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61897/#Comment_61897" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-23T02:14:59+00:00" title="March 23, 2007  2:14AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey guys?<br/><br/>I'm sure the your personal insights into the history and culture of CCGs are interesting to somebody.

There's a fair amount of color in that game - iconic characters, all the minutiae of the old World of Darkness, politics, brutal combat, intrigue. We certainly enjoyed that stuff, and there is a LOT of smack-talk at the table. (Smack-talk is a big element in strategy for many players). However, SIS-making is generally considered a <i>bad thing</i> by serious players. It will lead you to misplay, the creation of suboptimal decks and strategies, and the like. While there is definitely cred given to people who can make a strongly themed deck work well, you'd rarely want to take such a deck into a serious game. "Story decks" are for casual games, and everybody in the game has to be on the same page.<br/><br/>One reason I gave up the game is an increasing dominance of casual play in my local scene, which made table dynamics very uneven and unpredictable - essentially, the "story player" would end up throwing the game somewhat randomly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61941/#Comment_61941" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-23T09:27:29+00:00" title="March 23, 2007  9:27AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jyhad/VtES also differs from MtG in that it has unique characters as a core part of the game design ( at least this was true of MtG when I was playing a decade ago.

This is what happens when you read forums at night while tired and grumpy:(<br/><br/>I'm afraid I didn't encounter much of what you were referring to (in LotFR CCG) in the CCGs that I played.  The interactions between the players tended to be much more smack-talk than anything else.  <br/><br/>Robert's question about whether LotFR was very character-oriented (not sure because I haven't played it) is pretty interesting.  Certainly I would think if there's a character, there might be more opportunity for player immersion.<br/><br/>I remember a few Christmases ago watching my nephew playing the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mattel-B9945-Yu-Gi-Oh-Duel-Assessory/dp/B00009VE2N" rel="nofollow">Duel Disk Accessory</a> he had just gotten as a present.

M:TG players have a game world that connects the cards in a specific set -- it doesn't have the depth of the Lot5R game world.  Assuming that the Magic players have role-played before, they probably haven't played in that game world, which means that they don't have any role-play experience from that game to bring into the card game.  Further, the setup of Magic is all about you as a wizard summoning troops to fight your opponent's troops, so the wizard you is one step removed from the action of the game.  I'm not certain about the other game, but from your description (specifically, "So I hit him, like this."), it sounds like you're actually playing a character in the card game, and not removed from the game like you are in Magic.<br/><br/>Now this really goes into the analysis part that you stated you didn't care about, but I think it's important to realize that the structure of the game itself will lead to the immersion factor.  If you actually play a character in the Lot5R game like I assume above, the two games you've brought up aren't on an equal footing for immersive gameplay.  Because at least one of these games is set up to distance yourself from the action of the game, that may be why this thread hasn't produced many anecdotes about SIS in CCGs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62009/#Comment_62009" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-23T20:37:25+00:00" title="March 23, 2007  8:37PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I personally played the <i>On the Edge</i> CCG with a rough sort of SIS. It wasn't, in fact, because I brought the background from the Over the Edge roleplaying game with me--it was conversely that I was <i>un</i>familiar with the OtE setting, so all the specificity and nuance and personality and bizarreness on the cards whetted my appetite. I and my friends would pore over the cards and try to piece together a sense of what the setting was "really like" based on these little rectangular windows into it. I personally employed ruthlessly themed decks, especially of the Chaos/Cut-ups cards, which I was particularly enamored with. I think the SIS-generation of the player group was individual and varied, with me at the higher end of things. We didn't go so far as to speak dialogue or describe scenes, but there was this sort of underlying current of "OK, in this little world represented by cards on the table, <i>some</i>thing is happening.<br/><br/>I eventually moved on to the OtE roleyplaying game, because I loved the setting so much that I did want to actually roleplay in it. In a way it was a letdown in this regard, because the descriptions in the gamebook rarely gave a much clearer picture than the cards. Also, in the absence of "Hard details" about the setting such as you get from having, say, a set of movies to refer to like in Star Wars, I found it was particularly hard (and foolheaded) to try to get setting "faithfulness" without knowing what the standard to adhere to even <i>is</i>. Now that I've unclenched a bit and am freer with the setting, making it my own, play is a lot more relaxed and fun. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>RE the issue of "Story Decks" vs. competitive decks--I'm quite familiar with that divide, having been on the other side of the fence in many CCG interactions. I would put together my Star Wars deck, say, with the main goal of getting Lukie Skywalker out there with Luke's Lightsaber, possibly flying Red 5. And my brother would pile on his Star Destroyers and Stormtroopers, optimized for utmost gameplay efficiency, and totally cream me while I was waiting for Luke to even show up. And I would get mad. Because what's the point of playing Star Wars, if you don't get to have Luke, Han and Leia out doing their heroic thing? The idea that you could put together a deck for such a game without any consideration for Theme or Story and probably win over most decks optimized for Theme and Story rankled me quite a bit.<br/><br/>That's how I played SW and Middle Earth, anyway. For games less invested in a beloved setting, such as Magic, I was a little more relaxed. Though I fell in love with the whole Gerard and the Weatherlight thread of meta-story, and to this day when I occasionally bust out the cards, if I can work Weatherlight-themed cards into my deck at all, I will. And someday I want to make, once I've assembled a suitable "cast" for it, a "Phyrexian High School" deck. ("Phyrexian [hall] Monitor," "Phyrexian [bus] Driver," "Demonic Tutor," etc. . .)

I liked the strategy and the combos and the randomness and just plain winning. But I loved the stuff on the cards. There was totally <i>some</i> kind of imagined space going on there, in a very big way. The thing is, it happened entirely outside of play. While playing the game I was playing the game. While <i>not</i> playing the game I could sit around and look at all the cards and wonder about what kind of person the snarky Jaya Ballard was or how Lim-Dul got so powerful or how Krov had turned into a city of decadence. I could feel the tension between old and new in <i>Fallen Empires</i>, try to divine the personalities of Urza and Mishra from their associated cards, &amp;c. Piecing a world together out of these disparate elements was cool, because so much of the world in my head came from things being just how I imagined it. In play? Not much of that, really.<br/><br/>The best thing I can compare it to is the classic D&amp;D experience of sitting around making up places or characters by yourself. That's not very "shared," but there is a lot of "imagined space" to it.<br/><br/>Incidentally, what really ruined this for me was when Magic started to have novels (which I've never read) and even put little storybooks in the card packs (that was <i>Tempest</i>, I think?). At that point, I hadn't been playing for a while but was still buying them on occasion. Afterward, without really knowing why, I kinda stopped caring. A more definite world is exactly what pushed me away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62069/#Comment_62069" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-25T15:21:31+00:00" title="March 25, 2007  3:21PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Much better.

Thomas is right above that there's a great deal of backstory that's communicated through the cards, and there are cards that represent particular characters from that story.  Well, actually, most are non-unique and represent an archetype that a given character falls into - the designers have stated that they just felt like "Matsu Gohei" was a more evocative name for a card than "Lion Clan Charger" or something.<br/><br/>There's a lot of player investment in the story as a whole, but also in the individual factions within the game, and a lot of crossover between the CCG, the RPG, and (especially at conventions) the LARPs that get run in the setting.  A lot of folks also had online personae (basically setting-specific handles) that they'd go by, or costume as, or whatever.  So you'd get a fair bit of impromptu roleplay and a good deal of costuming at major tournaments, as well as the groups' supporters rallying together in their various factions to "root for their own" or what not.<br/><br/>On the other hand, in the play of the game itself you're not playing a specific character, at least any more than in Magic you're playing a wizard.  Well, maybe a little more, in that your not-in-the-game warlord belongs to a particular faction.<br/><br/>I never, though, in my years of playing the CCG, encountered a true SIS within the game's play itself except in really small bursts.  At most, you get the occasional player who will "narrate" events or try to craft story out of a game, but as Mark said above about VTES, that tends to be discouraged to some extent.  (Less so than in VTES, though, which is a multiplayer game and has much less "faction identification", so it's somewhat more disruptive to the flow of things.)  There are, maybe, little bits of SIS that happen in thinking about the interaction of a particular chain of cards, and those can be cool, but they're rarely something that is more than a brief moment.  And I haven't personally seen that to the level you're talking about in the initial posts, and imagine that the guy's opponent was sitting there rolling his eyes and thinking "just sit down and play, dammit" if it wasn't a case of a friendly game between folks who both were into that and knew each other.<br/><br/>So that's L5R.  Based on my experience with that, VTES, and Magic, I'd hypothesize that:<br/>- games like Magic don't have much of an SIS because there's not much to base it on or structure it;<br/>- games like L5R or VTES which do have something to base it on and structure it (ie, a rich shared setting) tend not to get it because, well, if you want that experience there's an actual RPG to play instead, and so you're probably playing the CCG for the card play; <br/>- in either case, it really snaps the disbelief suspenders to try to make the chaos and oddities of gameplay  logically flow into an interesting story.<br/><br/>- D.J.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62294/#Comment_62294" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-27T14:52:22+00:00" title="March 27, 2007  2:52PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            DJ,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.

The fact that you have an Investigator card who actually journeys to locations and encounters things helps a lot, as well as the Story Cards themselves that give a pretty strong framework for what your story's about.<br/><br/>A couple of other games that move in this direction: Doomtown has colorful and evocative characters that move between locations in your shared "town" and get into conflicts with each other (though there's nothing really encouraging you to say what those conflicts actually ARE, other than steps toward the goal of controlling the town. The Star Trek CCG had a bit of this too, where you would crew a Ship and send it to different planets to solve missions, wherein you would encounter hidden Dilemmas to negotiate using your Away Team's abilities. I think there's a SG thread about that somewhere, exploring the CCGs applicability toward roleplaying.<br/><br/>And finally, the Middle Earth card game, which I think i mentioned above, also has the "form a party and travel around a fleshed-out world" angle, though the context of the story is fairly abstract: win by either destroying the One Ring (hard, requires a lot of specific rare cards and a whole lotta luck), or "marshalling the forces of the Free Peoples of Middle Earth" against Sauron (basically, get enough "ally points" from the Rohirrim and Lorien Elves and so forth).<br/><br/>And with that, I think I've contributed about all I possibly could to this thread. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62336/#Comment_62336" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-28T05:47:35+00:00" title="March 28, 2007  5:47AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know what SIS means, but I might be able to add something re CCGs from the tone of the conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was heavily involved with the Raw Deal CCG (the WWE CCG where you play wrestlers like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin etc). Whilst the game itself doesn't do much to encourage any sort of immersion or storytelling within the gameplay, the players on the other hand do. On my website (www.squared-circle.info/sqc   - the UK fansite for the game) we have a 'Feuds Board'. This goes above and beyond people talking smack to each other about their play abilities but actually has people taking on roleplay-style personas, with their own stables and enacting actual feuds with other players. These are RP'd on the board and then the pay-off is the card game at a tournament or national event. There may be deck-building stipulations, there may be consequences for winning or losing - it all depends on the feud. Naturally, whilst the gameplay itself doesn't facilitate this at all, the background material of the game allows the players to mimic it and use the card game as a resolution device.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother way that the game has been used in the past is to build what I can only call 'Televised Constructed Decks'. You sit and watch a match (usually a longer PPV match) and build your deck around the moves and the actions that are represented in that match. A favourite of mine was the Rock/StoneCold WM17 match - I used that to demo the game for years. Because of the way the game plays, it mimics the moves of the match rather well and although the sequencing is random and therefore not the same as the televised match, it is a way to play the game recounting an event rather than building an optimal deck.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62341/#Comment_62341" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-28T08:24:38+00:00" title="March 28, 2007  8:24AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vodkashok</cite>I don't know what SIS means</blockquote>"Shared imagined space."<br/><br/>The Forge glossary calls it "the fictional content of play as it is established among participants through role-playing interactions."

I'd forgotten about Mythos, but it definitely was <i>almost</i> there, yeah.  Doomtown, in my experience, ended up feeling, in play, sort of like a spaghetti western, but again, there was the RPG to draw on if you really wanted to create a story, so like L5R and VTES, not much incentive to do it through the game.  LOTR's CCG was kind of neat in that it felt like if you wrote down the events as they were played out, you could construct a Tolkienesque narrative, but I don't have enough actual play experience of it to know whether it'd really build a SIS.  I also wonder how the more effective decks would deform that (ie, bend away from a clean narrative in favor of a "killer" deck).<br/><br/>Neil - AWESOME contribution.  I think what might make Raw Deal so much more effective at creating this kind of SIS is some combination of: <br/>a) strong fan familiarity and common language/expectations about a rich source material;<br/>b) a clear sense that the "game" represents a single, discrete event (right?) of a match, in which the twists and turns within the ring can make sense as played out on the cards;<br/>c) definite precedent for a large amount of the story happening <i>outside</i> the game itself - in this case, out of the ring - which lets that same SIS and energy persist through and even between multiple games;<br/>and d) no clear alternative vehicle for creating a roleplaying situation (sure, Kayfabe or Contenders, possibly others I don't know, but they're not as well known as Raw Deal is).<br/><br/>I'd say it's mostly the combination of B and D that makes Raw Deal work in this way - and when I think about the Raw Deal players/events I've seen on the periphery of my attention at cons, etc, I think it definitely does.

The deck was so easy to immerse into: with an evocative title, a unifying theme, and a couple characterful 'kill cards', you can design a deck that has an inherent story.<br/><br/>This deck told the story of a goblin mining colony who, with some charismatic leaders and weird contraptions, turned into a kamikaze suicide cult.<br/><br/>Preconstructed decks often have a unifying theme.<br/><br/><br/>So, yeah... in CCGs, same as stuff like Warhammer, I find that the immersion comes from themed army/deck creation, and referencing back to that during play.<br/><br/>Similar to the Raw Deal deck designed with a certain match or cool sequence of actions in mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62638/#Comment_62638" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-31T14:10:51+00:00" title="March 31, 2007  2:10PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe,<br/><br/>I'm not interested in immersion, unless there's some building of shared imagined space to go along with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20T" title="Thomas T"><img alt="Thomas T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/027/nDUV380FY7DP5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20T">Thomas T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62641/#Comment_62641" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-31T15:50:15+00:00" title="March 31, 2007  3:50PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 31, 2007 3:51PM by Thomas T.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The most I've ever seen this happen was in the old werewolf card game - Rage.  <br/><br/>There was very little abstraction and masses of personality.  You picked your pack of 2-4 garou characters and they started in play there in front of you; drawing them was enver a concern.  They are the game to you.  And almost every card that could go in your deck is an action they can take, a piece of gear that one of them uses or a special power they can have.  It was all so much more personal than any other CCG I've played, and the play helped support that.<br/><br/>The flow of the game and the nature of the cards lent itself very easily to seeing things in terms of what was going on in the game world.   In combat, the main focus of the game, each attack was a card you played with an evotive name and illustration.  There was no such thing as "attack for two damage", it was "solid strike" or "eyes gouged" or "broken limb" and there would be several of these a turn, back and forth.  It all painted a vivid picture of what was supposed to be going on.  It was hard <i>not</i> to think about what the cardplay represented.<br/><br/>In the player's guide (white-wolf published book about how to play, basic tactics, game variants, designer's notes and so forth) it even talks about creating a story as a valid goal for play - almost roleplaying with the cards.   Encouraging you to describe <i>how</i> and <i>where</i> your character does what he does. I'm not sure if this was a concern in the minds of the designers, or if it was just stuck in for the werewolf rpg connection, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was the former.  Certainly there's a lot about the game that encouraged that kind of play.  I'd even go so far as to say that it was the major thing that made the game fun to us over other CCGs at the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62642/#Comment_62642" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-31T16:58:22+00:00" title="March 31, 2007  4:58PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thomas: Interesting!<br/><br/><br/>Okay... So I'm forming a couple of hypotheses about what might be going on here, in these instances where the CCG becomes something more creative than a mere abstract strategy game. These are not necessarily mutually exclusive.<br/><br/>a) There's something going in the design of some games -- but not others -- which actually encourages creation of shared imagined space and thus supports a sort of story gaming.<br/><br/>b) Being playable card games, they need be functional, playable game designs. This, in contrast to the texts of the proper "role-playing games" set in the same fictional setting, which sadly are not required to present playable game designs in order to sell. It would make sense if players who tried to play the actual RPG of something and had frustrating, incoherent experiences with that, for whatever reasons, simply turned to the card game version as a sort of "alternative system" for gaming in their favorite setting.<br/><br/>If (a) is the case, then maybe there's some cool under-appreciated feature of these CCGs that can be swiped for an awesome card-based story game. This is sort of what I was hoping for. If (b) is the case, well, the solution would be to produce better-designed RPG texts that support functional gameplay in the first place. Which process is, happily, already occurring.<br/><br/>Most evidence seems to be pointing to (b) right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62643/#Comment_62643" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-31T19:12:15+00:00" title="March 31, 2007  7:12PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Larry,<br/><br/>How do you feel about games where the narrative of play <i>is</i> that there's a game being played? For instance, the Yu-Gi-Oh card game. On the one hand, you could handwave it away and say "You're just playing a game. There's no SIS here." On the other hand, you could analogize it to boffer LARPing: you're doing something that your character would do. It seems like a lot of the people playing it, particularly kids like in Chris' example, are in fact looking at it as a way to experience the fiction rather than just the game from the fiction. I'd hazard to say that structuring the fiction as something that's all about the game makes it a lot more accessible, since there's no awareness of the game as an abstraction to get in the way. The fiction here <i>is</i> "You played this card," directly.<br/><br/>Raw Deal and Rage seem to have a similar thing going, with the card-playing directly mapping onto events in the narrative, like what kind of move one of your characters uses on another.<br/><br/>A step up from that, you've got Lot5R and Star Wars using cards to represent discrete resources that you're managing like a general managing his troops. The actions are less concrete, but the game tokens still represent very concrete fictional elements.<br/><br/>Compare to Magic, where it's pretty hard to figure out what exactly the card-playing represents, other than the abstract idea of "godlike wizards' duel." At least, it's hard for me and most of the others commenting on this thread, it seems. What the heck's actually happening when you summon a Serra Angel and tell it to block a Moss Viper? Who knows! (But, when you remove the game-playing from the equation, it becomes a lot easier to think of the cards as representing actual people and places in some kind of fiction. I guess this is why I used to really like thinking about the setting of Magic <i>while not playing the game</i>.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62644/#Comment_62644" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-31T20:50:49+00:00" title="March 31, 2007  8:50PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Larry,<br/><br/>b) is certainly my experience.
