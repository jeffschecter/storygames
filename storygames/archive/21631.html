DC 20 to not get lost. (I.e. under 12 they both get lost and they didn\u2019t find them.)</p></blockquote><p>In our game, they asked their guide (an NPC) in character if they could follow the quarry. And they replied in character that \u201cYeah, we can do it if we make a DC 12 roll, and a DC 20 to also not get lost. But it\u2019s up to you, should we go for it?\u201d</p><p>The first time this happened a few years ago we came up with the explanation that the characters are speaking common (or Chultan, or Midani) and in their own tongue they are not saying these things. It\u2019s just how what they <em>are</em> saying is translated into our language. Perhaps their language is just more precise when it comes to dealing with odds and chances. Like they could be say something like \u201cYeah, it\u2019s probably a 2/3 chance we can find them but also a 2/3 chance that we lose our own way in the attempt.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re growing accustomed to it. At first it was getting raised eyebrows but here, the tension of the situation was maintained, it just felt really natural.</p><p>It does sound weird, but the alternative (even worse) would be to drop out of character and instead address the players, not address the PCs. Like when they started talking about alignment and levels and xp on Adventure Time it felt really natural and made the point of the episode much clearer. It didn\u2019t feel gamey to me, watching those episodes, it just felt like very clear shorthand for what they were trying to do. (Funny, yes, but not surreal/gamey. YMMV)</p><p>(Of course a <em>better</em> alternative would be to try to rephrase it such that it only uses words that the characters would know but still conveys the situation well enough to the players to make a call. Like the \u201cyeah it\u2019s probably a two thirds chance\u2026\u201d etc above. But that\u2019s super hard to do in the moment.)</p><p>I guess this is a natural consequence of my style which is that we are playing make-believe fully and freely, allowing ourselves to sort of \u201cbe\u201d in the characters, and since the physics of that world <em>does</em> revolve around DCs, HP, exhaustion levels etc\u2026 it also becomes part of our language. \u201cI think I can hit them, I have a +6 and I\u2019ll use insp \u2013 should I go for it?\u201d is something that someone might say, just as someone would say \u201cI think I can hit them, the wind is so stable and they don\u2019t seem to be moving very much \u2013 should I go for it?\u201d. Like, a friend of mine was talking about running some sort of game where the conceit was that they were inside a living video game or something so that they could freely use terms like this, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m going for at all \u2013 I replied that we <em>were</em> using the terms in this way but not that they were video game terms. It\u2019s just reality. Characters being taken on as NPC retainers haggle for a good price \u201cbecause we are level nines\u201d. When being asked \u201cis [a particular NPC] trustworthy\u201d, they\u2019ll say \u201cwe\u2019ve worked with him many times and he\u2019s always delivered \u2013 but when we were fighting side by side, I\u2019ve seen him use sneak attacks on our foes, so he might have had some shady training\u201d.</p><p>And, also, this is one of the best parts of Fudge <small>(and I can\u2019t believe Fate threw that out the window by reintroducing the numbers</small>. In Fudge you\u2019d say \u201cYeah, it\u2019s Fairly easy to find them but we\u2019ll have a Great difficulty keeping track of our own location in the process\u201d. Percentile games would also be somewhat more natural sounding in this regard than the d20 system. If I were making my own perfect game the fudge scale and 4dF would definitely be a core part of it. (I like the \u201croll high on d20\u201d well enough to not care to tinker with this part of D&amp;D though \u2013 we have a <em>lot</em> of house rules but they need to pull their weight.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473091/#Comment_473091" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-02T03:37:09+00:00" title="May  2, 2018  3:37AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The descriptive difficulty scale is one of my favorite parts of FUDGE (also Rolemaster) as well!

From my perspective it's part of the dramatic irony inherent in rpg storytelling. The form encourages this and, in my opinion, benefits from it - I do not underwrite the traditional virtue of imitation, where the table experience tries to mimic the fiction. Players are not medieval adventurers, and they will gain added clarity and appreciation for the content if it is not willfully pushed through various ye olde medievalese filters.<br/><br/>Nothing is more clear than a NPC telling the adventurers that "yeah, I don't think I'm gonna do what you want - not unless you beat DC 20 in a Diplomacy check." Players who know what that means and represents are perfectly capable of filling in the holes, just like you don't have to stop to explain what "chivalrous" means to an audience fluent in chivalric romances. Plus you can always go dual-track and provide both the in-fiction dialogue and the ironic "actual facts" rendition if you need to.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I don't get the appeal of the adjective thing in <i>Fudge</i> and similar games. I mean, we all understand that it's just re-named numbers, right? It's no different from any game with a difficulty scale, and worse than about half of them because "Great difficulty" is just about the shittiest possible way to define something that the GM would ostensibly need to relate to the fictional circumstances. What would be "Great" weightlifting? A car tire? A car? Who knows, we're just told that some things are "Mediocre" and some are "Great". No shit.<br/><br/>And that's from a big fan of <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, which does this same exact thing. I tried to mitigate it in <i>Solar System</i> by providing a concrete dramatically contextual scale of definitions for what the different adjectives mean. I almost manage to use the adjectives sometimes, too, rather than just going with numbers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473106/#Comment_473106" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-02T11:09:31+00:00" title="May  2, 2018 11:09AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Grumpiness warning<br/>Well I don't like it people stating numbers at the table.

This doesn't extend to NPCs that aren't their party members. And ofc I reserve the right to have those NPCs turn on them at a moments notice and I do them in dialogue scenes. But I have another player running them in the attacks and tracking things. It also offloads my work. But maybe the immersion cost is too big for it to be worth it?
