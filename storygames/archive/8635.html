Choose 5 terms from the list, these are the ones you are NOT required to use in your design. The rest must be present in some meaningful way in your design. Real diehards should use all the terms.<br/><br/>The deadline is February 13th, by 2300 Greenwich time. <br/><br/>The terms now follow:<br/><br/>Sharp darts<br/><br/>Aphrodite<br/><br/>Enchanted bows and arrows<br/><br/>STDs<br/><br/>Death<br/><br/>Emo<br/><br/>Denial<br/><br/>Carotid<br/><br/>Flirtatious<br/><br/>Paranoid<br/><br/>Envy<br/><br/>Seven deadly sins<br/><br/>Cards<br/><br/>Flesh<br/><br/>Impalement<br/><br/>Plasma<br/><br/>Lovesickness<br/><br/>Head on a pike<br/><br/>Et tu, Brute<br/><br/>Pyramid head<br/><br/>Hannah Montana<br/><br/>Death notes<br/><br/>Rainbow dragon<br/><br/>Chubbs the Valentine\u2019s Day Dragon<br/><br/>Conversation hearts<br/><br/>Tendons<br/><br/>Ligaments<br/><br/>Lovers quarrel<br/><br/>Catfight<br/><br/>Torching malls<br/><br/>Graffiti<br/><br/>The pimpmobile<br/><br/>Unrequited love<br/><br/>Sacrificial love<br/><br/>Cupid<br/><br/>Roses<br/><br/>Red<br/><br/>Pink<br/><br/>Heart<br/><br/>Chocolate<br/><br/>Blood<br/><br/>Arterial spray in the shape of a rainbow<br/><br/>Jugular<br/><br/>King Loveton<br/><br/>Shameless commercialism<br/><br/>Shuriken in the shape of broken hearts<br/><br/>Happy pills<br/><br/>Men in white coats<br/><br/>\u201cThey coming to take me away, ha ha\u201d<br/><br/>Derivatives<br/><br/>Canadia<br/><br/>Black Parade                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191230/#Comment_191230" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-04T15:13:03+00:00" title="February  4, 2009  3:13PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            seriously 52 (47) ingredients?

HA!<br/>3. in order to "beat your cupid", so to speak, a player must excuse themselves from the table and engage in masterbation<br/>whilst locked in the washroom. then they must wash their hands and return to the table. everyone will know that they have<br/>masterbated, it's part of the game- kind of like, whatever.

It is played out as the events of a Valentine's Day in your town, but the parts of your town that have slipped between the cracks, where the harsh and prosaic merge with the whimsical and fantastic. It is the story of those who live in a lonely age.<br/><br/> In a Lonely Age uses the narration and conflict rules from In A Wicked Age. <br/><br/>Draw four random elements from the Oracle. Create characters suggested by the Oracle elements. Each character needs a name and reason he/she is lonely (e.g.: My wife died. I don't have time for anyone but me. My love doesn't know I exist.). Then fill in for each character at least two items under "I will stop being lonely if:" as you would create Best Interests in In a Wicked Age. As with Best Interests they should be aimed at other characters and could range from "I get A to fall in love with me" to "I steal a precious heirloom from A to complete my love potion". <br/><br/>Each character will have 6 dice: a d12, a d10, a d8, 2 d6, and a d4. Assign one to each form (With Love, etc) as for IAWA. Then add a descriptor to each one explaining in what way your character acts with love, or for himself, etc. In conflict you will choose dice based on the descriptor, NOT the general form. The list of descriptors is not meant to be exhaustive.<br/><br/>(with love): jealous, warm and open, longing, passionate<br/>(with violence): brute force, sheer willpower, deliberate torture<br/>(for myself): oblivious, calculating, self-reliant<br/>(for others): generous, natural leader, protective<br/>(directly): blunt, unyielding, in your face<br/>(covertly): secretive, frightened, deceptive <br/><br/>During conflict the stick may be used to Exhaust (damaging With Violence and Directly) or Shame (damaging For Myself and With Love).<br/><br/>Begin play as for In A Wicked Age.

But this small town hides a secret. If you visit, you soon realize something is amiss. Perhaps it is the ornate church in the center of town dedicated to the Valorous Saints. Perhaps it is how the population is surprisingly fit. Perhaps it's because rather than small dogs, the women of Hannah, Montana walk small cherubic beasts with wings and fat pink bodies.<br/><br/>The truth is, Hannah, Montana is the home of the Sanguine Order of Santus Valentinus an ancient order of Church Knights founded over 2,500 years ago. An esoteric order focusing largely on learning and study, they under go a fascinating transformation during the late Winter season. During this time members of the order travel the world, bringing love, romance, and joy to potential couples which they select through curious divination routines (such as plucking rose petals or examining cards for hidden messages). Then, as the day of their namesakes arrives, the knights slaughter the chosen couples with as much brutality and collateral damage as feasible.<br/><br/>562 B.C. The Three Most Worthy Knights (Ejekial, Riguriel, and Susan) found the order of Santus Valentinus on the dual principles of love and brutality. The order is tasked by Pope Morris II with the elimination of dragons and the romantics on which they feed.<br/><br/>315 B.C. The first Rainbow Dragon is encountered by the Order. More civilized and intelligent than most dragons, this was the first true challenge they encountered since their formation. In the following four centuries the Order was nearly wiped out by subtle plots and romantic entanglements.<br/><br/>8 B.C.

Grand Mistress Susan (descended from the Most Worthy Knight) and Chubbs, now known as the Valentine's Day Dragon, are the signatories. The Church threatens excommunication over the treaty, especially the Dragon's condition of editing the Seven Deadly Sins article, but the paper work was lost.<br/><br/>171 A.D. After many years of successful collaboration, the Rainbow Dragons have become full members of the order, as signified by the election of Chubbs, the Valentine's Day Dragon to lead the order following the combat death of Grand Mistress Susan.<br/><br/>831 A.D.

Then the player attempts to match the each distinct value appearing in the opposed roll. For example, a B,B,R on an opposed roll requires that the B and the P be matched, but not the R. The player counts the smallest number of matching dice he or she of the dice values rolled by the opposition. So if the player needs to match the above roll and had rolled a P,R,R and had added a B as a balance die, the smallest match would be 1, from the Bs, rather than 2 from the Rs. If the number of matches is a 0, the action fails, otherwise the knight succeeds, according to the match table. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some examples of matches.

Three of the expertise (Deriving, Carding, and De\ufb02owering) help the Knights locate possible couples. Three of them help the knights to enhance the love of the couple (Heartbreaking, Cupiding, and Conversing). The GM should keep track (using index cards, or the like) of the couples located or spontaneously formed, their love level and where they are. A love level of 0 or less means that the couple is not romantic. A love level of 1 is the starting point for a viable couple, but no slaughter will be gained by their deaths. A love level of 2 is the minimum for slaughter to be gained from the couple, but it is at love level 3 and above that the couple\u2019s romance can include bystanders as productive targets for slaughter. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">When using expertise to locate a couple, the GM has a prospective couple, track the love level starting at 0. Each expertise can be used at most once per couple (with the exception of Cupiding, which may be used once per person). For each success on an expertise action add 1 to the love level, but for each failure subtract two from the love level of that couple, and one from the love level of any persons nearby. Alternatively, on a failure the GM can make the love unrequited in that couple. The love level remains the same, but any slaughter gained in the vicinity also in\ufb02icts that much Emo on the acting Knight. This may be remedied by two successes on a single Heartbreaking, Cupiding, or Conversing roll. </p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192504/#Comment_192504" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-13T14:48:04+00:00" title="February 13, 2009  2:48PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2009 7:25AM by wyrmwood.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<h3>Emo </h3>\nEmo is an a\ufb04iction much like leprosy, but to which the Valentine Knight is particularly vulnerable due to their dual charges of romance and slaughter.

Each session the knights should receive a location where they must go, and a slaughter total to achieve before they can leave. The former should be an interesting, fairly populated place, towns, cities, cruise ships, etc. The slaughter total should be at least 3 per knight, up to doubled by areas with especially large populations (and malls). </p><p style="text-align: justify;">The antagonists will often be the erstwhile lovers/victims of the knights. Remember, while it is the solemn duty of the knights to slaughter on Valentine\u2019s Day that\u2019s not going to make people accept it. Mall security guards especially are a concern. But the biggest threats for the knights are of two kinds: the Emo Knights and the Happy Folk. At least one of which ought to show up during the course of the session. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Emo Knights: Years ago, Aphrodite was a Cat Girl who succumbed to Emo. However she escaped the clutches of the RMB and has begun a guerilla war against the Order, and in favor of all things Emo. Reckless, \ufb02irtatious, and shamelessly commercial, the Emo Knights are a double risk to the Valentine Knights, not only can they wound or kill with Expertise, they can also choose to \ufb02irt, instead giving the poor Valentine Knight a love level for the Emo Knight. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Happy Folk: Cultists of the Self-Proclaimed King Loveton of Canadia, the Happy Folks are dealers and users of the world\u2019s \ufb01rst totally safe and completely happy drug, Happy Pills. These pills have only one side-e\ufb00ect, they diminish love, in favor of e\ufb00ervescent joy and happiness. While Happy Folks and their in\ufb02uence are around, matchmaking is extra di\ufb03cult (+2 dice opposing). And because their so happy the Happy Folks are all but immune to Valentine Knight powers. Only the most experienced Knights are sent to Canadia to try to stop Loveton, but so far, none have succeeded. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">A session of Valentine Knights will usually consist of a series of matchmaking-slaughter cycles, punctuated by a big threat. The cycle goes with the Knights locating a prospective couple or two, then building their love to the required level, and \ufb01nally the requisite slaughter. Each time through you should increase the di\ufb03culty, as tensions grow for prospective lovers and as SWAT teams arrive rapidly to the scenes of devastation. The aim is to build to a \ufb01nal slaughter, where the big threats, the government response, and the overall chaos of several spontaneous couples and their bystanders. Look for evocative locales, like funerals and basketball games. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, when the slaughter total is met, the knights sneak o\ufb00, fading into the background. Their work is done, and the world has been saved, for another year. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Not all sessions will start or end that way, but its a good formula to start with. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Now get out there and be Worthy enough to save the world. </p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192506/#Comment_192506" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-13T14:51:34+00:00" title="February 13, 2009  2:51PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So that's my gamehack of Christmas Ninjas for this Challenge.
