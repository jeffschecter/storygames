<p>Every Amber game I've ever played (and a very, very wide number of other systems):</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>"C'mon!  I know he's got a one-rank edge in Warfare, but I've totally got the advantage of numbers and a well trained army, plus I'm trying to shift the battle to Psyche!  I'm <em>totally sure</em> that should work, c'mon, c'mon!"</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I've mostly seen Pull discussed from the point of view of empowered (often equal) participants in the game, so that a person's choice to view the actions of another player as important is voluntary.</p>
<p>It strikes me that it is very different in tenor when the target of the pull is in a privileged position relative to the ... well, "supplicant" starts to sound like a good word.  The GM in many traditional games ends up in this position a fair amount of the time, so I expect that quite a few of us have a good amount of experience on both sides of the GM-screen with this phenomenon.</p>
<p>How do people go about achieving a functional social dynamic with that imbalance of power, and all that it implies for the modes in which they will be communicating?</p>
<p>What sort of responses are available to the (classic of "Amber") situation where two players are both beseeching the GM to grant them victory over the other?  Does Push/Pull give us any insight here?</p>

                            Tony, <br/><br/>I think it does. Mostly the players start to push at each other and pull at the GM, using up a lot of resources and time battling with each other while bowing down before the might of the GM. <br/><br/>Really, I've said it before, but half of me thinks Amber does this on purpouse. It's a game about dysfunctional families that spend most of their time fighting with each other, and the way the game is set up very often makes you replicate exactly that, with the PC group spending most of their time screwing each other rather than dealing with the issues in the larger world that they're supposed to care about. <br/><br/>But really, now that you say it, it makes me realize in the old days (3 years ago, so long and ancient ago) when I was an illusionist GM, my players would often spend vast amounts of time arguing and bickering with each other IC and (sometimes) OOC. They knew, I think, that they couldn't push me, and they wanted something they could have authority over, and so they pushed on each other and resorted to my-guyisms to get their ability to feel in control. <br/><br/>OTOH, the more participationist games I played often avoided this. Everyone there knew the way to power, by pleasing me. And I, in turn, knew the way to keep that power was to please them. I think the difference in the power dynamic was that in this type of game I had to worry about keeping the players engaged, and so had to give them what they wanted in order to lead them on. Its the difference between forcing them down the road and bribing them down it, and the result was, odd as it may sound, a lot less dysfunction. (Though a lot of freakishly hard work for me as GM, because this was before I even had systems with proper flags and crap like that.) <br/><br/>Really, I think there is a real way in which simply being able to see and openly acknowledge the power issues in a game opens the door to more functional play. <br/><br/>Let me ponder this, see if I can dig some AP examples out of my way back brain.                        </div>

<p>I'm not sure that I agree that Amber supports players pushing each other ... like ... at all.  I think everything goes through the GM.  That's why I felt stretched so damn thin when I GMed that game.  Every single thing that people wanted to do to each other (and yeah, that was <em>a lot</em>) they had to do by soliciting me to rule in their favor, so that I would then assert my authority on their behalf against the other player.</p>
<p>Totally a family dynamic, yes.  I see the same thing with my boys ... "If you keep doing that then Daddy's going to give you a TIME OUT!  Daddy!  Give him a TIME OUT!"</p>
<p>I'm totally interested to see the kinds of AP you have on the participationist thing, by the way ... that sounds fascinating.</p>

                            Tony, <br/><br/>Good point. I think what I meant was "players dysfunctionally pushing each other at the social level because they don't have any ability to push at the technical/game level." I think there is a very real way in which when a game doesn't support you having an ability to do something that you want to be able to do (be that push in a pull heavy game, pull in a push heavy game, or do either with force in a GM dominated game where you aren't the GM) it can lead to some degree of dysfunction or unhappiness. <br/><br/>Which may be one of the reasons why I could never get Amber to work well. I was always looking to do things the system didn't support me doing, or to get things from my players that they didn't have any system-supported means (or motivation) for doing. <br/><br/>So, um, are there any Amber lovers in the house? I think I need to talk to you guys before I talk about your game anymore, because I don't want to be insulting or start co-opting your stuff.                        </div>

                            Ben, <br/><br/>There is a difference between "if I don't like something I am harming you" and "when I blanket say that a game is dysfunctional I am dismissing the way others play without bothering to actually speak to them first."<br/><br/>And considering that our community has a noted and historical tendancy to do the second while claiming to do the first, I am not going to cross the line. If you don't like it, that's fine. You don't have to be me, do you?                        </div>

Given the incredibly wide swath of rules interpretations for most role-playing games and especially Amber, I fail to see how your critique of Amber could be anything but a critique of the communities you played it in.  Which is awesome.<br/>
<br/>
Even in the widest possible case, in which you said "all Amber play, everywhere, is dysfunctional and thus dismissable" (has anyone ever seriously said this sort of thing and meant it?), you would simply be wrong.  Your wrongness doesn't bother me, really.  It has no capacity to cause me harm.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it's a tangent to this thread -- Do we need a big "community discussion" thread where we talk about how it is okay to judge others? God I hope not! -- What I mean to say is: Go on, you will have no trouble from me on that account.<br/>

<p>Hey, for what it's worth, <strong>I</strong> love Amber with a deep (and sometimes shameful) passion <em>despite</em> (perhaps because of) the ways in which it makes me unhappy.</p>
<p>There is a part of me that says "I am better at manipulating the GM than any of these other guys ... I'll take 'em apart!" and smiles with glee.  I've been in a few games where that was the accepted mode of competition, and it was definitely fun.  Exhausting in a lot of ways, but fun.</p>

                            My Amber used such a different resolution system from what the two of you are describing I don't even know if it is worth discussing in the same thread.<br/>
<br/>
But, for what it's worth: We took the attributes very seriously, and the question of overcoming an attribute imbalance was a matter of how much you were willing to escalate in terms of damage to the other and damage to yourself (so, for instance, the guy with slightly lower warfare can win if he wants to KILL while the other guy is just fooling around.  Likewise, if he's willing to die while the other guy wants to get away without a scratch.)  "But I was clever" was regarded as generally a pretty paltry defense (that's my recollection -- I was GM most of the time.)<br/>
<br/>
Player competition was also not terribly the focus of the game, though.  A lot of the game was simply a question of fantasy fulfillment, socialization (large mixed-gender high school group) and pure joy of exploration.  People really liked going to new shadows, making up shadows, and finding cool things in shadow to show their siblings.  I still have 50 pages of notes in my closet about the ecology of Gregor's Shadow Jungle.<br/>

<p>I've seen a lot of this joy-of-exploration thing turn into solitaire, though ... there's really little to nothing drawing people toward a common experience, and there's a ton of centrifugal rewards tearing them apart.</p>
<p>I wonder whether that's why Amber has such a healthy PBeM presence?  The medium certainly supports the sort of decentralized play that can evolve naturally from the dynamic.</p>

                            Tony, <br/><br/>I've wondered the same about Ars Magica, with the amount of massive back book keeping and ability to detail every detail. But Ars doesn't, that I'm aware of, have the PBEM or MUSH/Chat presence that Amber has. <br/><br/>So I'm not sure what to think about that. <br/><br/>Ben, <br/><br/>That's often what happened with us, but at a very unofficial level. "How much I'm willing to take pain is how much I want to win" was the biggest method of resolution we used. Cleverness might get you a few points, but self-mutilation always won.                        </div>

<p>Oh!  Oh!  (EDIT:  Cross-posted) My previous post is not as off-topic as it sounds.</p>
<p>When player power is by pulling the GM, it makes the GM more important than other players, right?  So time when the other players are in the spotlight is more likely to be <em>boring time</em> for all the other players.  It's when unimportant stuff is happening.</p>
<p>Going solo can minimize that boring time by giving you a higher percentage of GM attention.</p>
<p>Now I know that people do a huge amount of in-depth socialization in Amber games, so it's not as if they aren't interacting with each other.  But Andy's comment about the entourage reminded me of the whole double-life that I've seen develop ... where people have (on the one hand) a healthy but often trivial social life with the other player's characters and (on the other hand) a world and resources that they are building up entirely solo.</p>

                            Again, Tony, you are talking about playing a totally different game than I am.  I'd like to emphasize that -- when we talk about "playing amber" we are talking about different games.<br/>
<br/>
In my game, there is literally zero point to going off in Shadow alone.  The "cool stuff" goal is not "GM provides me with cool stuff" but "I, creator, provide my friends with cool stuff."  Going off alone is actively harmful to the social goals, here.<br/>

<p>Ben:  Yeah ... I should have emphasized that.  We are, indeed, talking about different games.</p>
<p>I'm interested to hear, in your game, where the mechanics got used, and what sort of import those moments had for people.</p>

                            It's hard to step away from Amber in this, if only because most of the personal examples I can think of come from it.  The degree of GM Fiat makes, as Tony has noted, a fascinating social game with the limiter being how well you can pitch your idea as cool to the GM (or how well you can figure out what the GM thinks is cool, and go towards it).<br/>
<br/>
However, this is actually soemthign we've run into specifically and concretely in Fate.  Here's the situation: aspects that cause problems for a player grant them fate points, but grant them the option to buy off the trouble.  As such, ideally, if I have the aspect "alchoholic" and the GM puts a drink in front of me, he does so while putting down a fate point.  If I take the drink (whihc presumably causes soem other problem), I get the point, but if I decide that I don't want to go down that path, I can pay one of my own fate points, and pass up on the drink.<br/>
<br/>
This is a pretty simple exchange when everyone is aware what aspects are ont he table and in play, but in reality, the GM is not always on top of all his player's aspects, and situations frequently arise where a player feels that this would be an excellent time for their aspect to come up but the GM hasn't made the connection.   The question that comes up is "how can the player express that to the GM?"<br/>
<br/>
Now, no answer to that is going to be completely satisfying because, in the end, the GM can say no, so there's no way to _make_ this happen.  Still, the GM is hopefully more than happy to bring aspect-flavored pain to the characters, so assumign the GM is not purely obstructionist, the player has a few options.<br/>
<br/>
1) Sulking - This is.....problematic<br/>
<br/>
2) Explicitly stating their need - This works just fine, but it's awkward.  If it's during a pause between scenes or the like, then it can be ideal, but in the midst of a scene, it can throw off pacing.  it also puts the GM on the spot, which can be good or bad depending on the dynamic.<br/>
<br/>
3) Ritual/structured language - The model that has evolved in play has been most successful for us has revolved around the player addressing the GM, holding up a fate point (the poker chip, bead or whatever) and making a statement about their character with an emphasis on the specific wording of the aspect.  Flipping a token in hand, looking at the GM and stating "This should sounds like _Risky Business_" <br/>
 tends to do the job.<br/>
<br/>
Now, while #3 probably works best for the specific needs of Fate, the real key has been making sure it's clear to the players that this is something they _can_ do.  Once that lesson is in place, it changes the relationship with the GM for players coming from a less open environment, and is all in all, a change for the better.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, dnot really an answer, but it is at least reasonably specific. :)<br/>

<p>Oh, yeah!  I've <em>had that problem</em> in some modified Fate.  My friend made it so that you could get Fate points by having an aspect apply a penalty to a roll ... but then I kept having to <em>ask him</em> for rolls that I was clearly going to fail because of the penalties.</p>
<p>"Dude, my guy has 'Not Very Smart' as an aspect.  Yes, he's trying to follow quantum-level physics in our Stargate briefing.  Yes, he's going to fail.  But I want my roll."</p>
