This is a modern noir game.  I then explained it in terms of authors, like the text does, and asked people what their experience with it was. There was one person who was far and away more of a fan of the genre than everyone else. I gave them the Investigator position.<br/><br/>Second, I used the novella grid even though the short story grid is supposedly geared more for shorter sessions. Having a bigger grid and more crimes made it more interesting. However, I kept an eye on the time and when there was about 30-45 minutes to go, I said "okay, we're going to skip ahead a little here" and went around the table just writing in people on the grid. People were fine with this, they had gotten the hang of writing names on the grid and a bit of what that meant.<br/><br/>Importantly, I have never had Crime Resolution be satisfying at any convention.  It is an extremely unconventional (no pun intended) mechanic that flies in the face of most mystery solving games, due to its randomness.  Letting people know about what it's going to be in advance may help with this.<br/><br/>That's it!!                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232114/#Comment_232114" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-13T15:18:55+00:00" title="September 13, 2009  3:18PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the three convention sessions I've run, I played the Investigator twice. The third time one of the players had played DS with me before, so I asked her to be the Investigator. I think it was easier to guide and teach as the first Authority than as the Investigator, so I'm probably going to stick with that unless no one else wants to be the Investigator.<br/><br/>As far as Crime Resolution being "random", the way I approach and explain it is that we need to explain why that person had to be the guilty party. It might fly in the face of mystery solving <i>games</i>, but it feels more like a detective story to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232163/#Comment_232163" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-13T23:15:40+00:00" title="September 13, 2009 11:15PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the issue is (in my experience) is that people tend to develop ideas of who they want to be the killer, but don't necessarily connect that to writing names on the grid, so the person the grid selects is often really not who we wanted at all.

It lets other players have a taste of being the Investigator too. In fact you should pitch it that way. "If you win you get to put a name on the crime grid and explain, as the Investigator in an internal monologue, how they could be guilty of one of the crimes."<br><br>It doesn't help if you are developing crimes that are very disparate or opposed, of course, but I haven't had that happen in play, usually the murder is closely related to the other crimes and they are "aligned", even if they are not technically done by the same person.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
