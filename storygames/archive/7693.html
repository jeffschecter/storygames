I won't bore you with details, since we kept it rather simple, me having just had time to give the rules a once-over before starting play. Anyway:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Idea</b><br/>\nThis is for handling the initiative in conflicts. It worked beautifully. Grab a piece of paper and make two rows on it (as in rectangles, wide enough to fit a die). Above the one, write "Success" and above the other, write "Failure".<br/>\nNow, make sure that every player has their own uniquely-coloured (I write it with a 'u' for you, Gregor) D10 for initiative. The aliens also have their own (mine is green and translucent). When everyone roll for Dominace, have them put their die in the Success row if they're successful, and in the other if they're not. Have them arrange the dice in the row, highest to lowest. So if you roll a high success, you put the die towards the front of the row, so as to give space behind it for the people with lower successes. It's really easy to do this everyone at once, and not as chaotic as it might sound.<br/>\nAnd there you have a simple initiative order. I use coloured plastic miniatures from a Swedish board game for the characters on the range map, and the players have dice of the same colour as their character, so it's really easy to look at who's at what range and acts at what time (very important for grenade use). I'm thinking of modifying my range map to have these two rows on it, so I can make do with one paper.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Question</b><br/>\nIs switching to a weapon, apart from hand-to-hand and grenades, a full action?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_S" title="Aaron_S"><img alt="Aaron_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/780/nLP7HPA6K2AES.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_S">Aaron_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170831/#Comment_170831" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T22:11:54+00:00" title="September 23, 2008 10:11PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having recently read (but not yet played) <i>3:16</i>, I'm really not qualified to answer your question. However, your idea for displaying Dominance sounds very cool, indeed. Also a great idea to match the colors of the dice and the minis.<br><br>In my brief solo play tests, I've found the Range Map to be a bit small. I'm either going to blow it up a bit, or incorporate it with your two-column idea.<br><br>Let us know if you whip up a PDF or something...

Short answer, you can switch your weapon on *any* successful NFA action, even if the primary goal is changing range, grabbing the macguffin, or setting the enemy up for an attack by spraying them with rocket fuel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170851/#Comment_170851" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T04:54:17+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  4:54AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a really cool idea. It reminds me of how Kevin Allen, Jr had us organize our order in a game of Primitive (using stones on a rabbit skin!).<br/><br/>I just shout out Successes, on 10, 9, 8, ... 1, OK - Failures, on 10, 9, 8... round ends! But I've only really been playing with 2 or 3 players recently.<br/><br/>Oh, and I'm really glad to hear the game rocked for you too. :-)<br/><br/>I think it's quite useful to go back to book having played the game and read it again. I've ended up doing this a lot myself since it seems a while ago that I wrote it and I can't remember my exact wording for things. I've found the Index really useful, actually, and I'm relieved that I put it in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
