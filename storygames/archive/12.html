                    Stealing a march from another discussion, I'd like to discuss how a game gains mindshare among the customer base. This seems to me to fit within the Praxis! rubric, somewhat -- well, more than the other discussions.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway:<br/>
<br/>
How is it that some games seem to suddenly attract a lot of interest -- also called "mindshare"?<br/>
<br/>
Is it a pushed thing -- i.e., something a company can control, via marketing, company recognition, careful design, etc.?<br/>
<br/>
Or is it a pulled thing -- i.e., something a company cannot control; the customers control the interest, sometimes due to unintentional factors on the company's part?<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for thoughts, anecdotes, and personal experiences. <br/>
<br/>
For example, back in college, one of my gaming buddies started a GURPS game. I borrowed his book, because I'd never seen or heard of GURPS before, fell in love, and started buying up supplements like nobody's business. <br/>
<br/>
Then I ran a GURPS game. One of my players was involved in the university gaming club; he became enraptured by the system, and started his own.<br/>
<br/>
Within a semester, GURPS book sales in my college town tripled, and it was the hot system on campus... until Vampire 1st ed.came out, with relatively major fanfare.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I see the above example as showing a pull situation: SJ Games had zero control over the uptick in GURPS play in State College, PA (except by putting out good stuff).<br/>
<br/>
Now, for whatever reason, I see the success of Vampire (and its ilk) as much more of a push situation: careful marketing, targeting a group of gamers with hithertofore unaddressed needs -- many of my buddies at the time remarked upon the "slickness" and appeal of the Vampire presentation compared to AD&amp;D2, GURPS, and HERO. <br/>
<br/>
Do you have an anecdote on how you've seen a game gain -- or lose! -- mindshare in the wild?<br/>

                            Push Mindshare is, from my point of view, very much based on creating a strong set of brand values. Defining an aspirational concept that people feel the need to buy into, which they do via buying your product, nominally based around three factors:<br/>
<br/>
Seperate <br/>
Group <br/>
Aesthetic <br/>
<br/>
So for Vampire (from personal experience):<br/>
<br/>
Seperate (ROLEplayers not ROLLplayers, it's about story,  games for mature minds)<br/>
Group (Camarilla fanclub, pin badges, and so on)<br/>
Aesthetic (Goth)<br/>
<br/>
Now, interestingly, look at The Forge as a brand in these terms:<br/>
<br/>
Seperate  (system does matter, not like traditional games, critical thinking about rpgs)<br/>
Group (online community, gencon booth, you can do it too attitude)<br/>
Aesthetic (Independent, small press, the little guy rejecting the big industry)<br/>
<br/>
Never underestimate people's need to self-define as being part of something...<br/>
<br/>
Course, for PULL you need to have a game that plays in a way people like to play too.<br/>

                            I don't think it can be overstated that sometimes mindshare is completely organic. I think Vampire was completely planned and RIFTS was completely by accident. A cover image, an iconic character, a mechanic are all possibilities.                        </div>

                            Community influence is as anecdotal as it gets, but I think it does make a difference.  I certainly know that I push systems as I enjoy them, from running "introductions" to mentioning it amongst communities both on-line and off.  I would believe word-of-mouth to be significant in the industry, if not reliable.  (I count myself responsible for more than 10 copies of Amber Diceless and "...Baron Munchausen" sold.  It's not a lot, but if there are others like me, that can add up!)                        </div>

<br/>
I agree: Vampire is a push and RIFTS is a pull (in terms of these descriptions).<br/>
<br/>
I have some ideas about RIFTS' pull:<br/>
1. Piggybacks off of D&amp;D (D&amp;D, but cooler/better!)<br/>
2. Big, lots of stuff to pick from.<br/>
3. Different, lots of different stuff to pick from.<br/>
4. Big splodey.<br/>
5. In my day, excellent gateway licenses -- TMNT and ROBOTECH.<br/>
6. "Consistent enough" for familiarity, with little tweaks for each book.<br/>

Still...<br/><br/>Anyway, in this day and age, it's got to be both, swirling together in a mad eddy of consumer frenzy. Uhhh, I dunno how to say this in clear paragraphs without spending a lot of time, so I'm going to break them up into thought-chunks:<br/><br/>* Push begets push: Many people will buy the next "Company X" thing irregardless of the quality, because they've spent the last Y years developing that Push through earlier excellent products, recognition, marketing, etc. Not to say those folks are drones or anything, this is expected consumer behavior.  It's also how Alliance shuffles their chips around their roulette board when they become invested in products.<br/><br/>* On the Internet, Push makes Pull, which begets more Pull. I'm going to throw it down: The Forge, RPGNet, enWorld, etc: Someone comes along with an "Announcement" of some kind, carefully prods and creates a sub-community in that area, and the next thing they know they've got a community of pullers generating interest for them. We see waves of it on RPGNet: Exalted (tho it's enough of a consistent seller it hardly needs the pull anymore), Weapons of the Gods, Burning Wheel, Anima (the anime-looking fantasy game coming soon from Spain), etc.<br/><br/>* I refer to RPGNet above because, hell, that's our machine. Without it, and the folks that dwell there that really like to become involved in their hobby, we wouldn't have seen the kinds of sales and community generation that we see for small-press games. God Bless the Internet and all that.<br/><br/><i><b>Do you have an anecdote on how you've seen a game gain -- or lose! -- mindshare in the wild?</b></i><br/>Weapons of the Gods. Because of the raw materials, Brad's excellent job of keeping in touch with a growing community with freebies and the like (he's like the Folk version of Luke Crane), and their treatment of the material (not just making yet another typical stats-and-skills game), he was able to get folks interested in the game long before it was out, and those folks interested in the game beat the drum mercilessly until it was released.<br/>It also kinda worked against them, as there were a lot of problems with the Chinese printers, delaying the game, which turned some of the following community into sourpusses ("Delay again?? But I want it Noooooooowwwww").<br/><br/>Another: Ben... crap forgot his last name, the "Promised Sands" post apoc/fantasy game. He really pushed hard on RPGNet to get the following community and the like, but unfortunately he pushed a little too hard.  Most of it was simply because he was really excited to have produced a game and wanted to share it with others.  However, for a few months for just about every game thread had a post from him on "How X worked in Promised Sands" or "How Y was different than Promised Sands, in which..." etc. People tired of it quickly.<br/><br/>Luke Crane (burning wheel) would be a great person to ask this question.<br/><br/>And Chad is also a great example of how Push (through quality product) and Pull (simply being out there, and being active at Pyramid, on Livejournal, etc) can quickly generate a community of loyal followers who will help push and pull for you.                        </div>

After a certain point, every further push offers diminishing returns, which eventually turn into negative returns.<br/><br/>All you can do is be available -- for when the pull comes to you. <br/><br/>When some of the pushing "wears off", you can offer brief pushes to "keep the plates spinning". . . but too much and you knock 'em off the sticks.<br/><br/>All you can do is wait and trust in the pull.<br/><br/><br/>CU                        </div>

<i>I'm curious, what negative returns do you see? Or have you seen?</i><br/><br/>If all a potential customer ever sees of a creator is just pimping out his product, eventually the potential customer metally tags the creator as a form of commercial, and thus ignores <b>everything</b> the creator says, and begins to actively dislike seeing any sort of post or message from the creator.<br/><br/>In some cases, this can lead to outright comments like "all I ever see from you is you pimping your game" which can lead to other (new to the discussion) potential customers adopting that outlook, or even flamewars -- whichin this case, not really positive publicity.<br/><br/><br/>CU                        </div>
