The magi all work for the benefit of the covenant (in theory), often by way of just working in their lab (sometimes for years at a time). Adventures are often motivated by the needs of a magus or the covenant. <br/><br/>Troupe style play involves more than just sharing the GMing. There's also shared characters - the grogs, mainly, but sometimes companions too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SambearPoet" title="SambearPoet"><img alt="SambearPoet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/993/n5R7M0VMJNJWY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SambearPoet">SambearPoet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102957/#Comment_102957" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-13T21:52:54+00:00" title="October 13, 2007  9:52PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's what happened when I played Ars Magica:<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThis was a one-on-one game, and yes, Covenant building was a big part of the game. The other player was the Magus and I played all the other characters as the GM - we never really switched off because the other player, W, didn't want to. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe game started in a Winter covenant (each covenant has seasons, the season you're in depicts what state your covenant is in - a covenant in Winter is dying and old, there's a lot of infighting and weirdness happening) and changed to a Spring covenant (a brand new one, getting started for the first time) when the Winter covenant decided to open up two new "daughter covenants" elsewhere, in hopes of kicking them out of Winter mode. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tAll of the stuff that you'd run into: not having a decent enough place; having to deal with the local nobility and Church, having to cope with the magical denizens (such as faeries, demons, etc.) of the area - that was the meat and drink of the game as was played. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe grogs were little more than a mechanic for fighting and a name: combat in ArM is really quick and deadly, and there ain't much in the way of easy healing to be had.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe Companions were the most interesting characters, to me. We had a blind nun who had premonitions of the future, a man cursed to laugh when he should cry and cry when he should laugh who was a crack archer and a woodsman, a young boy with faerie blood who was compelled to always tell the truth but could always tell when someone was lying.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tUltimately, we got through about three games of this, and it died because I believe the whole situation seemed pretty hopeless to poor ol' W and he got disillusioned and quit. I think that some wizards from House Tremere came in and took over when he gave up, giving us a somewhat unsatisfactory ending to the story.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe used the Covenants book to design the new covenant, and W got to basically design his grogs as well as his Magus, and we worked together to create the Companions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102961/#Comment_102961" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-13T23:34:36+00:00" title="October 13, 2007 11:34PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm running an Ars game, so I'll give you the setup and some thoughts.  You can judge for yourself what it's about.  In my estimation, this game is very similar to other Ars games I've played in.<br/><br/>Historical and geographic placement is a key factor in setting the stage and the kind of game you'll have.  We are starting in NW Bulgarian in 1180, when the Byzantine Empire still runs things.  We're five years from the start of a Bulgar rebellion that will succeed in kicking out the Greeks and instantiating a new Bulgar kingdom.  Historically, we also have a bitter rivalry between Venice and Constantinople that will culminate in the Fourth Crusade and the sacking of Constantinople by the Crusaders in 1204.  In 1187, the Turks under Saladin will kick the guts out of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the Holy Land will fall back under Saracen control.  So there's lots of mundane history poised to happen.<br/><br/>In theory, the players' actions might change history, and I'm open to that if they go there, but I don't expect it.  The Order of Hermes forbids tampering with the mundanes, and it's unlikely the players will choose to buck the Order.<br/><br/>The Hermetic backdrop has them located in the Transylvanian Tribunal, which is totally under the dominance of House Tremere, a house that in 5th ed Ars is basically the Order's Marine Corps (as opposed to the White Wolf continuity's take on them as the vampiric black hats).  The player covenant is a decrepit, almost forgotten Winter covenant inhabited by insane elder magi.  Other houses have an interest in preserving at least one covenant in the tribunal from Tremere control.<br/><br/>Players include a Bjornaer healer, a pair of incomprehensible, babbling and naive Criamon, and a Saracen Verditius hot to make automata.  The elder magi, who are mostly offstage gazing into their sorcery-warped navels, include a mad Bjornaer who spends most of his time as a giant spider in the catacombs beneath the covenant, a near senile Flambeau whose incredibly potent fire magics are indiscriminate and uncontrolled, and a Criamon who may be an echo or echoes of his own past.  There are three servants from the old covenant: a guy who is blind except when underground, a guy who is mute unless quoting Psalms, and a guy who is deaf unless you address him from out of hearing range.<br/><br/>We're early in the saga, so the stories have concerned grogs scrapping with bandits, a werewolf mystery in a nearby village, some exploration of the weird-ass covenant (the catacombs are basically dungeons at this point in the game), and a vis hunt into a faerie forest.  Veteran Ars players are probably nodding as they read this.  The magi are kvetching and debating as they figure out how to run the place and divide up responsibility.  All of them are ready to fast forward through a few seasons or years so they can beef up their magical skills.<br/><br/>I have tons of flags and story hooks, and the players are making some decisions as to what they're interested in doing.  As luck has it, the players except for the Bjornaer picked more of the inward-turning magical geek types.  The companions are more socially oriented, so the travel to the major metropolises will probably feature them.  The game could be about Hermetic politics and earning status in the Order among fellow magi.  It could be about Bulgar independence or about Byzantine-Venetian competition, or even about religious conflict.  It could be about exploring the covenant and reclaiming it.  It could be about getting as much magical bling as possible and buffing out wizardly Arts. It's also possible the players will get involved in the faerie realm or sell their souls.  Who knows?<br/><br/>Right now it's about exploration of the covenant and the wonder of magic.  I also expect melodrama to gain momentum as we proceed. The favorite characters currently are a pair of grogs who are essentially the same person, having been somehow "split" in a magical accident from a previous covenant.  The Annikas are starting as exactly the same on every detail on their character sheets...but one.  Black Annika has the personality type "Black-hearted" and White Annika has the personality trait "Good hearted."  When someone asks for an Annika, we pick randomly.  It's ticking along as an awesome "subplot."<br/><br/>Does this help?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MattJohnston" title="MattJohnston"><img alt="MattJohnston" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cimota.com/slypic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MattJohnston">MattJohnston</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102963/#Comment_102963" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T01:28:09+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  1:28AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When we started Ars Magica  we had the following premise:<br/><br/>1. The new Covenant was owned by a senior magus who was very very old.<br/>2. Player Mages were all going to be refugees from a destroyed Covenant in Transylvania.<br/>3. We didn't generate the Mage characters at the start, just their names.<br/>4. First ten sessions, everyone had either a Grog or Companion.<br/>5. Then everyone generated another character, grog or companion.<br/><br/>We started our exploring the region. The grogs would get orders from the myserious mages (via me, the ST) to fetch various obscure objects (sources of Vis). Eventually they woud become a lot more bold. All of the action centered around the Grogs to be honest. Their lives were the hustle and bustle.<br/><br/>I involved the Mages slowly. A Jerbiton magus began to travel everywhere with the Grogs. An Ex Miscellanea magus was tempted to sacrifice his friends for a tenth of the power of hell (he had to collect the right hands of 13 friends. He ended up collecting 12 (FROM PLAYER Characters) and then decided it might be too risky.<br/><br/>After they were familiar with the environment, I introduced the Covenants in the region, their rivalries. The Magus characters disappeared into council and the intrigues were all based around the Grogs.<br/><br/>Troupe Style is not about GM rotation. We oly ever had one GM. But it's about multiple characters. Our game grew to 11 players at one point, each with 1-3 characters. The intrigues became such that we abandoned the table and took to walking around the room. Queues formed at some players as people wanted to talk to them and would ask to speak to specific characters...<br/><br/>The Covenant isn't a meta game, it's another layer. To the Mages it was a refuge. The grogs, home.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sven" title="sven"><img alt="sven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sven">sven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102964/#Comment_102964" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T02:18:05+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  2:18AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A very common way of playing (not <b>the right</b> way or so, but common) is that each player has one magus and one companion. The general advise to *not* have you companion tightly tied to you magus, but you may very well have it tied to another players magus. In addition you would have a number of more fleshed out grogs which are shared. In a typical adventure you will need to leave the covenant with the group. At that we usually do a bit of met, since we usually want to plan so that each player get one character on the road. You can't just walk away from the covenant with all the magus, they often need to study and they probably don't want to leave it unprotected. If it doesn't seem reasonable to bring a main character for a certain player he can play one of the shared grogs.<br/><br/>We always talk about GM sharing, but haven't really done it much yet. The most common way of doing this is that you have a main GM who 'delegates' subplots to another GM, who doesn't have full access to everything about the main story. Personally I am quite much for transparency these days, so I might do out without keeping much secrets of the main plot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103004/#Comment_103004" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T12:54:56+00:00" title="October 14, 2007 12:54PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, your Magus is indeed often expected not to feature in the stories, because they have lots of other things to do. It is very common for a player to say "My Magus will be working in his lab for the next 3 seasons" and then not appear again for 9 months. It is even more common for a Magus only to be around for every second story or so, appearing only for council meetings. Even when all the Magi do turn up for "adventures" they are as likely to involve a visit to the local Tribunal to argue a point of order politics than they are to fight a dragon.<br/><br/>I would have said that a very typical game structure is that the PC's Magi are forming a new spring covenant, oftne starting from the very first act of finding some land to set it up on. The players generate some Magi (often one each, but sometimes more, though seldom less), a few companions (often fewer than the number of players to start with) and a set of grogs (more than the players generally) and the game revolves at first around setting up the covenant, building houses, making deals with the local nobles, fey and monsters, finding sources of vis, setting up relations with other covenants and so on. In this phase Magi do feature a lot in adventures, but they are seldom using a lot of magic.<br/><br/>Then the game moves into a phase where the covenant is more established and the Magi can turn to their own projects, reading books, designing spells, enchanting items, and so on, as well as starting on longevity potions or familiars. In this phase the Magi are out of play a lot and stories about the grogs and companions come to the fore, with the occasional Magi thrown in for more serious magical threats.<br/><br/>If the game is still going after this phase you do get a lot more serious things for the Magi to come out and show their powers. Grogs get a lot less important then, and companions too to some extent, but you still have as much politics as monsters, especially since a lot of games will encounter their first major Tribunals in this phase. Also the most significant threats for Magi in this phase (excepting demons and the fey) are other Magi, so fighting is not central to most conflicts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103036/#Comment_103036" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T17:10:11+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  5:10PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, I think I've got a bit of a picture of the game now.
