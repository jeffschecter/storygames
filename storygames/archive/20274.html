The direct drama power's not really my cup of tea, D&amp;D-wise, but there's nothing wrong with the idea of the bolt-on mechanic per se.<br/><br/>One thing you might consider would be to make that token reward (I assume it comes at the end of a session for unspent tokens, rather than every time somebody gains a token) lateral to experience rewards, instead of linearly additional. For example, you could degree that the player with the most tokens at the end of the session gets a "reward" (and if the GM has the most, nobody gets it). The reward could be e.g. +1 to a single attribute of the character, or a new class-appropriate special talent, or the quest-giver bestows an extra magical item on that character, or the promise of the next adventure hook being relevant to that specific character - best to choose something where your overall system needs shoring up. I guess if the part that needs shoring up is "characters aren't getting enough xp", then a xp reward makes sense, of course - but otherwise I see an extra reward system like that as firing on half-cylinders if it addresses a rewardable <i>behaviour</i>, but doesn't provide a particularly constructive <i>reward</i>.<br/><br/>I'm using the scheme I describe with the player with the mostest being rewarded in our summer Paranoia campaign (more similar to D&amp;D, that, than one might think). Works well, in part because of that point regarding shoring up: the rewards I distribute via this mechanism are specifically things the campaign needs more of, rather than merely "more experience points".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446838/#Comment_446838" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-17T12:00:24+00:00" title="July 17, 2015 12:00PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I guess if the part that needs shoring up is "characters aren't getting enough xp"</blockquote>\nThat's pretty much on target.

I run a pretty tight D&amp;D ship (fanatically so in some eyes) when it comes to reward accounting, and actively loathe unearned experience points, but I'm also very solid on the notion that monsters+treasure are not the only ways to gain XP; anything that can be framed as a challenge, and defeated, may gain XP. Thus characters have gained experience points for e.g. managing to get married and similar social challenges. Sometimes we could play quite a while without seeing even the theoretical opportunity for xp gain if we limited ourselves to monsters and treasure, such as when the party in toto decides to leave on a Crusade or do something else "adventurous, but not for pecuniary gain".<br/><br/>Of course the above notion of elevating challenge as the norm for xp gain only makes sense with a pretty focused Gamist view on the role of experience in the game. If the main desire is to have characters advance for the sake of pacing and such, then how about per-session rewards? 100 xp per character level simply for showing up would go a long way towards character advancement around here, and it'd be a simple matter to fine-tune the actual value.<br/><br/>Not that the idea of drama tokens giving a steady xp source needs improving upon per se, it scales nicely with the notion that the more events there are in the session, the more xp characters should gain. Does the same things e.g. Gygax attempted for in his latter days with his quest xp rules and such, but more elegantly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446898/#Comment_446898" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-17T20:11:25+00:00" title="July 17, 2015  8:11PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The players nixed it.

Would you tell the player "You could probably marry the merchant's daughter that's in love with you, but there's no challenge there, so 0 XP. On the other hand marrying the widow duchess that you were interested in, but were cold to you, would be worth 750 XP."<br/><br/>Would you do the same upfront with rumors in town, like "investigate the old burial ground: 300 XP each; find the harbor serial killer: 1000 XP" and so on?<br/><br/>In one way that would be a nice way to telegraph to the players how much challenge the GM expects following up on the rumor will be, but on the other hand it removes some of the uncertainty from the players if what they're doing is going to pay off. The GM tips his hand that the burial ground is minor quest, which may be good or bad depending on how much the players wants to stay in their characters' heads-<br/><br/>Also, the level of challenge, is that the expected time invested, number of clues needed, danger level of monsters expected, amount of treasure expected, or something else? The monsters will pay XP anyway, so getting quest XP for the level of opposition would pay double. Same with treasure. The 300 XP burial mound might contain a dozen level-draining ghosts and 10 000 gp; does that mean the quest XP should be higher to signal this to the players even though they have no way of knowing this before they go there?<br/><br/>Does it ever happen that the group as a whole realizes after the fact that this part was quite challenging and the PCs get quest XPs retro-actively?<br/><br/>The reason I ask for more details is that I'm interested in doing this in my current campaign. We play published modules, and at the moment I decide a quest XP level based on how big the module is, perhaps 1000 XP per PC or 1500 XP or something, that they receive at the end. We divide the XP between the number of sessions and the players only get XP for the sessions they attended. Attending three of four sessions of a 1000 XP module would net 750 XP.<br/><br/>The current module is a sandbox, where there are multiple locations that the PCs can go to and solve whatever the problem is there. I could split up the total quest XP between the different sites (300 XP for the burial mound, 500 XP for handling the orcs up north, and so on), but would you give the players this information upfront so they can decide if it's worth the effort or afterwards when they've solved it? I like the idea that handing out quest XP during the session would act as checkpoints to signal that something was achieved during the session. It would be nice to hand out XP to the bard if he nails a performance at the tavern, and not only when he kills an orc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446921/#Comment_446921" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-18T08:54:14+00:00" title="July 18, 2015  8:54AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In our game yesterday, the first half was running around the city doing small things.

On the other hand marrying the widow duchess that you were interested in, but were cold to you, would be worth 750 XP."</blockquote>\nYes, the concerns you go on to list are the specific ones I've wrestled with as well.<br/><br/>The old TSR method regarding quest experience, according to modules I've read, was largely to have the GM reveal the quest xp after the fact. "You laid the ghost to rest, glory be - have 500 xp!" I'm not entirely happy with this method, as it means that the reward is not acting to signal goals and focus play the same way treasure xp always does, because a player who doesn't know about a reward can't act upon that reward.<br/><br/>On the other hand, just as you say, the quest reward can be an annoyingly crucial meta-level information point in critical strategic decision-making, so it's no good to be declaring those in advance, either.<br/><br/>For these reasons I go with a reward declaration procedure that aligns largely with the "you get xp for treasure" model: the players know in the abstract what it takes to get xp, so <i>they</i> pre-declare their quests themselves. The GM verifies, the quest is done, and the GM scores it according to results at the end.<br/><br/>To be specific, the players know that quest xp is available, but that the criteria for it is "intentional adventurous accomplishment", usually explained less abstractly and with more examples. The "intentional" means that you don't get xp for deeds that happened by accident, alongside doing something else; the "adventurous" means that the activity has to be interesting and worthwhile for us to actually play through; "accomplishment" means that success is not trivial and it is significant, important in the fiction as well, for credible character psychology, rather than meaningless.<br/><br/>From this viewpoint the game's xp reward scheme can be analyzed a bit differently: it is the case that the characters are <i>by default</i> always on the quest of "become rich"; that's why they're getting xp for wealth. As you can affirm for yourself, finding treasures and keeping them is intentional, adventurous and accomplishment, so it qualifies as a quest <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>So the players know what could be a quest, and therefore they can suggest all sorts o things. I feel that this is an excellent, definitely worthy addition to the game's procedures, because by leaving the quest xp thing up to the players you ensure that they will actually communicate with you and each other in a goal-oriented manner about their play: instead of just telling you what they will do next, they will talk with you about their plans and intentions, as without doing that in advance they can't establish quests. A player could keep it secret that they want to become the baron in the baron's place, but if they never tell you that they're doing that intentionally, you won't give them quest xp once they finally do accomplish it. (In practice I end up occasionally giving quest xp for stuff where it was entirely obvious that it was a worthy quest engaged in intentionally, even when the players forget to add it to the quest log; the point is not mechanical formalism, but rather being clear about whether some events are a side effect or the point of the action.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446924/#Comment_446924" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-18T10:29:38+00:00" title="July 18, 2015 10:29AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've used fixed xp rewards negotiated in advance in the past for quest xp, but I've recently moved on to further emulate the treasure xp logic in this regard: the player can arrange in advance for their mission to count as a quest, but they won't know how much quest xp it will be worth until they accomplish it. The GM sets the xp amount, ideally on the basis of logical guidelines akin to the treasure xp guideline of "1 gp = 1 xp". For example, altruistic quests to help people generally net "1 person helped = 1 xp", which works well for me. There are also guidelines for saving individual named people from trouble, for revenge, for religious/ideological motivations and so forth.<br/><br/>The nice part about using clear guidelines is that it gives you the best of both worlds when it comes to strategic goal-orientation and retaining surprise: if I told the players in advance that the adventure is worth 2000 xp, they could use this information to gauge various facts about the adventure. If I told them nothing, they would basically have no good reason to go on the adventure (I think that it's entirely fair for players to only risk their characters when they feel like it, and naturally enough you don't want to risk your character unless there's xp to be had). With the above procedure I can say things like "Well, the princess has been kidnapped by the evil wizard, they say. If this is true and if you rescue the princess alive, it'd be worth 2000 xp to return her to her mother the queen." You can see how I can still talk about xp rewards, but instead of talking about them contractually, I talk speculatively now, just like we would discuss a supposed treasure in a dungeon. "Well, the local villagers have all sorts of wild stories about the old miner's treasure. Considering the general level of wealth in this village, you'd be surprised if the miner's treasure didn't amount to at least several hundred gold coins, to be worth talking about." Most significantly, that sort of speculation does not actually give solid and reliable information to the players, they still have to decide for themselves which of the contradictory and unreliable information sources they have at their disposal they will believe. Maybe the princess is already dead, maybe there isn't any old miner's treasure, who knows - we were talking hypotheticals earlier.<br/><br/>My xp guidelines are admittedly not very finished yet, so I have to often eyeball the appropriate level of quest reward more or less arbitrarily. I try to be reasonable and generous, it's important to not do injustice to the players just because I haven't quite figured out the entire picture yet. I would probably get around to finishing the framework quicker if I was actually running D&amp;D regularly instead of being mostly a player like I've been over the last couple of years.<br/><br/>As you can see, though, it's pretty clear what I think quest xp rewards should be based on: not on time spent, not on dangers encountered, but very clearly on <i>results accomplished</i>. This is unfair and chaotic, with some adventures being much too hard in hindsight, and sometimes you get immense windfalls. It encourages acting not in the spirit of a challenge, but rather using any hook or crook to accomplish the objective, ideally without even engaging the difficulties on the way at all if you possibly could avoid it. It is, in fact, exactly how treasure xp is granted. If one dislikes these features, then getting rid of treasure xp as well would be a smart move. Obviously enough I adore that scheme, and logically enough want other types of xp rewards to reflect that same logic: you get xp for each princess rescued, each soul salvaged (in adventurous context), no matter whether they're being guarded by a rapid dog or a dragon. Up to you to scout it out and decide whether you want to go against the resistance this time around; smart and successful adventurers will presumably only take the risk when it is commensurate with the reward.<br/><br/>It's also notable that under this regime characters can "lose" their greedy motivation in part or entirely; a character who takes holy orders, for instance, will logically no longer gain xp for treasure, and a character who simply is filthy rich in their own social context will likewise be less greedy in the future. This is one good reason for PCs to not save money like pack-rats; once you've got 10 000 gp under your mattress, I pretty much assume that either you'll spend them, or establish how your character's ambitions grow to a wider scope, or you agree that the character isn't adventuring for money any more, but rather for some other reason.<br/><br/>I'll also mention that because I'm treating quest xp as sort of a motivation-based scheme (we are basically rewarding the player characters for achieving the things they themselves think of as important, rather than assuming that everybody needs to amass massive amounts of gold whether they need it or not), it makes sense to force xp penalties upon characters with split motivations. The basic scheme I've often used in this regard is to let a PC take on a quest related to some adventure, but at the cost of halving any treasure xp they'll get for that same quest; the new quest sort of makes the pecuniary motivation fade and take the back seat. This would basically be the balancing scheme to ensure that characters don't benefit too much for multiple quests related to the same adventure. Not that I've had any significant problems in that regard yet, but at least I know what to do when and if some player figures out that their character wants to do this adventure as a good deed, to enrich himself, to atone for his sins and to avenge his dead brother, all at once <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
