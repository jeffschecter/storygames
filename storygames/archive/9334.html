Until recently it was a standard Initiative, Declare, Act, Resolve system that used rolls to hit, rolls to damage, and hitpoints. I have made some changes to resolution, discarded the extra damage roll (damage is now based directly on the attack test and the weapon used), and dumped the use of hit points all together. Now for the structure of combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the seemingly standard structure of rolling for initiative to determine turn order, declaring actions, and then resolving them the best way to go? Of course it can depend on the game setting, but I'm just trying to get some alternative ideas to evaluate my system against. I realize the rest of the system can also impact the best way to structure combat, so here's a basic rundown of what I've got right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nDice pool system using d6 with a standard target number of 5+ to score a hit. Dice pool determined by adding general skill rank (Small Arms), ranging 1-3, and skill rank (Pistol), ranging 1-7. Difficulty is number of hits required. Dice pool may also be modified.<br/>\nNumber of hits scored on attack test are used to determine damage inflicted. Each weapon has two damage variables, base and increment. Base damage is inflicted by single hit (or hits equal to difficulty), with each additional hit inflicting incremental damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrake has Small Arms at 2 and Pistol at 4. He has a laser sight on his weapon giving him +1d for a total of 7 dice. He makes a Pistol test against a difficulty of 2 and scores an impressive 4 hits. His pistol deals 4 (5) damage, indicating base (increment). The first 2 hits equal the difficulty and so cause 4 damage, with the remaining 2 hits dealing 5 damage each for a total of 14 damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nArmor is applied next, with damage location and armor coverage represented but handled abstractly (requires no additional rolls or tables, it's built in).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy current combat structure is as follows:<br/>\nAdd Perception + Reflex + d6 for each character to determine initiative.<br/>\nDeclare and resolve each character's action in initiative order with the option to delay action.<br/>\nMost injuries do not take effect until the end of the round, but being hit early on could impose dice pool penalties.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are some of the better combat systems out there when it comes to structure of play (not damage and wounds)? Seems like there should be a better way to structure combat as far as initiative, declarations, execute, resolve. I'm familiar with Shadowrun, WoD, Burning Empires, and a few others. Looking for something a bit more elegant or intuitive I guess.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206872/#Comment_206872" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-12T08:09:50+00:00" title="May 12, 2009  8:09AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It all depends what you want combat to <i>do</i> in your game. What do you want it to do? What role does it play?<br/><br/>For example, in 3:16, you're trying to take out Threat Tokens. When you take out each one, you roll to see how many Kills you get. That's because counting kills is a big thing in 3:16. Also, a flashback can get you out of a fight, because those are a big thing, too.<br/><br/>But in something like The Shab Al-Hiri Roach, fights <i>aren't</i> a thing. If they happen, they'll just be a battle over Reputation, like other conflicts. So they're all mixed in with the main system.<br/><br/>So, yes. What role does combat play in your game?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206883/#Comment_206883" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-12T08:58:19+00:00" title="May 12, 2009  8:58AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a counter question, what do players/characters do outside of formalized combat?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic system is, as you said, fairly standard. That means that there's little that's 'wrong' or unworkable about the structure. If a standard feeling to combat is what you're going for, you're on the right track. If, on the other hand, the game is intended to focus on areas other than combat, with combat being a last resort, then a robust combat system is working against this goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm seeing from this is that your game models a situation where you're going to be shooting furiously, and missing more often than not (2:1 odds of missing). What does initiative add to this? What is its intended purpose? If I hit enough times to kill (or injure, if negative states greater than dead exist), is it going to prevent or affect your attack, if I got the initiative? How much is 4+4+5+5 damage? Did Drake just kill his opponent easily? Did he barely wing him? Does he need to hit an awful lot to kill his opponent, or is one or two hits enough? For that matter, what is the effect of numeric damage, without hitpoints? Is it intentional that as your skill goes up, you get to fire more times, or am I wrong in assuming that "hits" are in any way related to shots fired?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Natai" title="Natai"><img alt="Natai" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Natai">Natai</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207109/#Comment_207109" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-13T11:29:19+00:00" title="May 13, 2009 11:29AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, some great questions thus far.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasic concept of setting: A colony ship leaves Earth in the midst of a war that presumably wipes out all life on Earth. There are other colonies, but this will be the first self-sustaining so this ship likely carries with it the last chance for humanity to survive. Fast forward, a colony is established but not on the planet intended. This planet is populated by several alien races scattered and largely isolated after decades of war. After Humans establish a few major settlements (in alien ruins) a disaster wipes out much of their advanced tech and infrastructure, placing them on a more even plane with the other races. So now all the races are spread around in larger settlements and are just beginning to reenter and explore the world outside of their cities and major trade routes. Really basic, but you get the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe intent is for the setting to allow for a wide range of game styles. Fantasy, cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic, and sci-fi (planet-bound) can all be pursued. Social conflict, infiltration, and combat can all play major or minor roles as desired. There will likely by smaller microsystems for each, if necessary, but the core mechanics will stay constant. When used, combat should be fast and furious. Battles should not be long and should carry a considerable risk. Serious injury should be considered a very possible (in some cases likely) outcome. Death is a possibility and combat sshould not be initiated lightly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the specifics: "Hits" refer to any dice which come up 5 or higher, not just in combat, so they have no relation to shots fired. The system considers a dice pool of 5 to be "average" so a typical roll should result in at least one hit. The system also uses opposed rolls for defensive actions which factor into the actual result of the roll. So the odds of missing are based on the skill of the parties involved and probably can't be summed up in 2:1 odds of missing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the effects of damage: damage results in wounds of varying degrees, superficial, minor, serious,critical, lethal. Depending on factors such as weapon and strength, a single hit is generally superficial (grazed), 2-3 hits in the minor-serious range, 3-5 hits in the critical-lethal range. Several superficial or even minor wounds are inconvenient but not incapacitating. However, a couple of serious or critical wounds are a major problem. Taking action to avoid damage is a far safer approach than trying to take the hit. In short, it doesn't take much to take a target down.<br/>\nThe intent behind initiative is to provide a benefit to faster, better-trained, better-prepared, or more aware characters. At the same time, these characters should not be invulnerable to combat. I like the idea of faster vs stronger where neither one is inherently better, but they require different approaches and make use of different mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou've given me a lot to think about. I look forward to hearing more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207134/#Comment_207134" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-13T14:01:21+00:00" title="May 13, 2009  2:01PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is Empire of Dust available again yet?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf so you should check it out.<br/>\na) I think the setting will be right up your ally<br/>\nb) the fighty bits meet all of your general criteria above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Natai" title="Natai"><img alt="Natai" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Natai">Natai</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207817/#Comment_207817" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-17T15:27:48+00:00" title="May 17, 2009  3:27PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I looked around for information on it, but it doesn't seem like it's going to be available anytime soon.

It's fairly brutal though, as I recall. The last time I played it, I got my head largely staved in by an ogre or a troll. I managed to survive, but I literally had a hole in my skull. I think I dodged brain damage by a thin margin, and maybe the expenditure of Artha. It's been a  couple years tho', so it could be that I'm embroidering the tale a bit. <br>\n<br>\nYour description put me in mind of The Riddle of Steel, which was a fantasy 'dueling' system, that used literal wounds, and tracked bloodloss, shock and pain instead of 'hitpoints'. It was also fairly brutal, maybe a bit more crunchy than you're looking for, but as far as detailed, 'realistic' combat systems go, you could do far worse than take some notes from The Riddle of Steel.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
