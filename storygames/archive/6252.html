Has anyone looked into BookSurge? What are the advantages/disadvantages for an Indie publisher using the service? (On the face of it, getting distribution through Amazon would seem to be a "good thing" for a publisher, but I'm sure there are gotchas involved -- what might they be?)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
