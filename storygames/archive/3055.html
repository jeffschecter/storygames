It totally doesn't have anything about childhood trauma in it."<br/><br/>Then, on page two:<br/>"It's not necessary to speak only<br/>about the mysterious events on the island \xe2\u20ac\u201c as long<br/>as the other players are interested, you can talk about<br/>music, religion, marital problems, events in your youth"<br/><br/>And later on I was like, "Man, I wonder what RPGPundit would do if he read THIS one."<br/><br/>Then, on page four:<br/>"On the fresh cross on the sport<br/>fisher's grave, someone has<br/>written \xc2\xabswine\xc2\xbb with black paint."<br/><br/>And I was basically in hysterics.

Until We Sink is not a typical roleplaying game, most of all because its target audience isnt roleplayers but everyday people. I can see Until We Sink in a slim cardboard box being sold next to games like Cluedo and How To Host A Murder Mystery in bookstores al over the country!<br/><br/>Ill get back to this question later, Im eating breakfast now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
