It's a long-running game that I've only just joined, so I've had to settle in by inches, get to know people and so forth.  But there's one guy....<br/><br/>His character's name is Dirk Pitt.  Dirk Pitt as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Pitt" rel="nofollow">the hero of many Clive Cussler novels</a>.  They don't have a lot else in common, so far as I can tell (he's bedded no willing lasses), but he's still called Dirk Pitt and I don't care how you slice it, that's just goofy.  It's akin to playing a spy game and deciding your character's name is going to be James Bond.  It's just not <i>done</i>.<br/><br/>Now I understand that coming up with the right name can sometimes be trial.  But some names just have to be off limits because they have too much baggage attached.  So no Han Solos or Luke Skywalkers, please.  Or some names are just too silly for the subject matter.  Like "Phil the Samurai."<br/><br/>There's not anything to be done about this particular player or his character's name.  They're involved in the game and that's that.  But I wonder what techniques you may have employed to, ah, <i>gently discourage</i> similar choices in your own games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ldd23" title="ldd23"><img alt="ldd23" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ldd23">ldd23</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284122/#Comment_284122" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-03T08:52:07+00:00" title="August  3, 2010  8:52AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Say, "no goofy names, please"?<br/><br/>I'll admit it's a weakness of mine sometimes.

It's occurred to me that the other players just don't <i>know</i> that it's borrowed from other media \u2014 not everybody knows Clive Cussler, after all \u2014 and that might have something to do with it.  I'm not going to cause a ruckus by asking around.<br/><br/>Anyway, I wanted to draw out a bigger discussion of names and their suitability for play, as opposed to just complain about one guy's choice at the gaming table.

Many names I like are quite authentic and in character (e.g. Bransanthilis) but thoroughly unpronounceable.  Others capture the feel of the character but are distracting (e.g. Dirk Pitt = Brad Pitt as Dirk Gently).  Personally, I think names are important and that duping a name is is usually uncalled for.  As [sort of] noted above, a duplicate name should [in my opinion] always been done intentionally to avoid it being distracting - you should give a duped name because you want to confront it.  Can you live up to the name?  Is the name your bane, given by foolish parents.  Is your name apt to those who know you?  Is there a story about your naming?  Justify the dupelication!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, how often are you called by your full name?

(I don't know <i>why</i>, 'cause Hunter's awesome.)<br><br/>Now: in my Hex Rangers game, featuring two folks who were now Stephen Hunter fans because I turned them on to the stuff, I named an important NPC (the high commander of the United States Hex Rangers) Ephraim Swagger, with the deliberate implication that he was Earl Swagger's ancestor.

Not that bad really, but the funny sounds never fit with the naming scheme anyone else uses. We've talked to him about it before and it just doesn't phase him. This next point is a little off the subject of names but, I think, still relevant: During a supers game he decided his android character looked EXACTLY like Max Headroom. Now, I don't mind the reference as a guide post, but imagining Max Headroom running around along side the JLA like PC's made the whole thing either too stupid or too Grant Morrison to work. Once again, he just didn't see the problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
