What I am presenting to you is a *<b>Setting in a Box</b>* to be used with the <b>Dreamwake</b> rules. The document does not include a <i>World Deck</i>... yet... but just by using the <i>Crunchy Bits</i> provided you will end up playing a very SLA-like game even if you know nothing of the setting.<br/><br/>But why is that so? Are we never going to have a full World Deck, as instead was promised?<br/>The answer ties in with the updates I've been hinting at lately.<br/><br/>YES... you are going to get a full World Deck for both the original Dreamwake, and SLA Industries, and other future SiaB.<br/><br/>YES... each card is going to have <b>its own beautiful and original</b> illustration, specifically made for it. What you can download right now from the UnPlayableGames.tk website is just a prototipe meant to explain the kind of thing I have in mind.<br/><br/>YES... it is all going to start happeing soon. If all goes to plan, as soon as this summer (around June or July).<br/>So stay tuned!<br/><br/>I am of course available here on the forum for any doubt, question, comment and amiable chat ^__^<br/>The file itself is downloadable for <b>free</b> in the <i>Dreamwake</i> section of my page: <a href="http://www.UnPlayableGames.tk" rel="nofollow">www.UnPlayableGames.tk</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
