                    For the record... the title is facetious.<br/><br/>But I'm trying to bring a bit more exposure of indie games to a local con that's taking place March 2-4th.<br/>I'm going to be running 5 games, with a couple other indie games being run by friends of mine.<br/><br/>The gaming group I'm currently a part of is doing a bit of self-branding right now. We have a Yahoo discussion group and are basically attempting to advance indie and/or experimental gaming, gain a larger playtesting net, show people new Forge-y ideas, and stimulate the flow of creative energy in Vancouver. I'm thinking about having a handful of pamphlets with our gamer bios, our mission statement (yeah, we have one), our name/logo, and a list of games we hope to explore in the near future. Has anyone done something like this for an individual group?<br/><br/>I'm running a session of Perfect, two sessions of Polarpunk (my game in playtest), and two sessions of The Shadow of Yesterday.<br/>Kirk Mitchell is running a session of his game in playtest, Kin.<br/>Daniel Wood is running a session of Dogs in the Vineyard.<br/><br/>The game pitches I posted for my games are:
<blockquote>Polarpunk: The Hunt for Chicago (3 of 6 spots remaining)<br/><br/>In a post-apocalyptic future, the second ice age has come. Humanity has been living in isolated bunker colonies for generations, while polar bears have claimed the earth as the new dominant species. As advanced scout's for your bunker-colony's reclaimation efforts, it is your job to scavenge the ruins of fallen cities, make first contact with the other tribes, and to start the fight of reclaimation. It is your job to bring humankind topside once again. Polarpunk is a game focused on providing fast, fun, dynamic gameplay. It puts a lot of focus on combat and exploration, and has a light-hearted playstyle. It's all about making things "awesome!". As it's still in playtest, there are bound to be some bugs and gags, but signing up means you can help take a role in creasing them out and providing feedback.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The Shadow of Yesterday: The Cursed Forge (FULL)<br/><br/>Using Clinton R. Nixon's award winning The Shadow of Yesterday system, I plan to run a different kind of dungeon crawl: One focused on tragedy and humanity and what being a hero means. If you've never encountered The Shadow of Yesterday before, the designer sums it up quite well: "Set in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world where the creation of a moon has ravaged cultures and thrown the fate of the earth into question, TSOY is like a Weird Tales contribution written by Emily Bronte."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Perfect: A Well Placed Dagger (FULL)<br/><br/>Upon request, I'm going to be running my own published indie title, Perfect. Set in a dystopian, Victoriana world, Perfect is a game about criminal passions and rebellion. Can you hold onto the things that you care about, or will you be forced to sever ties? "It's like Kafka and Charlotte Bronte had children, and those children wrote Blade Runner." Malcolm Craig (A|State, Cold City) "Folks, Perfect is an excellent game. Your character's gonna sweat, cry, get tortured, flip out and commit crime, and you will love every damn minute of it." (Remi Treuer, of the Durham 3 podcast)</blockquote>
<blockquote>TSOY: The Earth Trembles in an Uncharted Language (just put it up, 5 of 6 spots remain open)<br/><br/>As Knights of New Empire, it is your job to tour the borders of New Empire, collecting taxes and pledges of fealty. Everything is going according to protocol, until you reach the home of the mud people. The mud people refuse to answer your demands. Worse, they refuse to let you leave. They have secrets that are worth killing to protect. The Earth Trembles in an Uncharted Language is a scenario of dark fantasy and horror, pitting the Knights of New Empire against their deepest, darkest fears. The game is run on Clinton R. Nixon's The Shadow of Yesterday system, and is open to beginners.</blockquote>
<blockquote> Polarpunk: The Aeon Machine (5 of 6 spots remain open)<br/><br/>[same description as the first Polarpunk session].</blockquote>
So, that's my contribution.<br/>Most games haven't gotten many sign-ups yet, so I'm surprised to see my first TSoY and Perfect game full already (both had only 4 slots, but still), and my first Polarpunk game at the halfway mark!<br/><br/>I want to ask the experienced con-people for advice on:<br/>1.) Running productive playtests.<br/>2.) Promoting a play group, as well as indie games in general.<br/>3.) Getting the most out of small cons.<br/><br/>And any feedback on my write-ups or games would be great, too!                </div>

                            Hi Joe, <br/><br/>I'd put "playtest" in the titles as appropriate, since that is either a draw or a repellant and you want it to do both.  <br/><br/>Do you have contact with the organizers?  Are they supportive, hesitant, confused?  <br/><br/>Since you've already got many sign-ups, I don't think you're going to have a hard time meeting people who share your enthusiasm.  From a promotion angle, you might consider a related round-table or panel discussion on design or publishing.    Something like that might get interested people together in the same room at least, and would serve as a catalyst for promoting play outside the con, make connections, and so forth.                        </div>

                            I thought about doing something like this a while ago and came up with the following tactics:<br/><br/>* Get as many people as you can to run games of the type you want to see.<br/><br/>* Make sure you're running game that can take large numbers of players (5-6 as a minimum).  This might mean changing the games you run so you're running the ones which can support large groups easily.<br/><br/>* Try to half fill as many games as you can by getting people to come along who you know who are already converts.  That way you are running all those games even if nobody else is interested.  I realise that the point is to get converts to the story gaming cause (which sounds a bit nefarious to me), but you'll look like a right plonker if you turn up with a game to run and you don't get enough players.  I was at a Con last weekend and there were a couple of games which were announced and which nobody signed up for.  That made people think that either the game being run or the GM are a bit rubbish.<br/><br/>* <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Make lots of noise, so that it's clear you are enjoying yourself.</span>  As Jason points out, you will end up enjoying yourself, and the masses will see that this is good.<br/><br/>* If you are playtesting at a Con, try to get some decent feedback.  I found this somewhat hard when I ran a playtest of UmlÃ¤ut lately, because everyone who played was really enjoying themselves and having a great time.  So when you try to pick out what didn't work, you generally get the response "Nothing, it's totally awesome!!!"  So take notes as the game is running.<br/><br/>TBH it sounds like you're doing most of this already though.                        </div>

                            Do.  Not.  Wander.<br/>
<br/>
The way you'll be able to form community outside of the sessions is if people have an idea where that community is located <i>geographically</i>.  If they want to go talk with some indie folks, they should know where to go.<br/>
<br/>
So set up a base-camp for your group, and make sure that it's "staffed" as best you can.<br/>
<br/>
Wandering around and drawing people into discussion?  That's something to do when you are surplus at the base-camp.  Otherwise, trust that people will come <b>to you</b>, as long as they consistently know where it is that they should go.                        </div>

I meant "You will probably end up making lots of noise, like every other group in the room and it obvious that you are enjoying yourself" rather than "Make extra noise to make sure people know", so yeah, what Jason said.  Ah, the joys of interwebness and not double checking the wording of everything you type...<br><br>Unless you are playing "Gay Recruitment Squad Wants You!" of course, where you actually <i>do</i> have to make more noise than usual.                        </br></br></div>

                            The impression I got, at Conception, from being a Collective Endeavour groupie, was that people are more interested in the games than the group. There were posters up everywhere about the Collective Endeavour, but what really generated interest were the games: they were booked up well in advance.<br><br>So my impression is that you should start with the games: get people to play, show them a good time, then tell them about the group, rather than hitting them with your gamer bios and mission statement straight away.<br><br>The game write-ups look great. Personally, I like the ones that start with the setting ("As Knights of New Empire, it is your job to tour the borders of New Empire...") rather than "Upon request, I'll be running my own system...". On the Polarpunk one, I'd find it more grabby if you started with what I'll do in the game: i.e. scavenging alien cities and making contact with tribes.<br/><br/>I fully support Rich Stokes' idea that you should be as loud as possible.

It was a good spot, Jason.  The last thing I need is some asshat with a megaphone ruining a con and then telling the FBI "Rich told me to do it!!!"<br/><br/>Although it does make me think of an interesting point: I think that games with slightly odd equipment get more attention at Cons.  I mean, I got a lot of people stopping by my table at Conception when the Lego Pirate ship was out, and the Lego Dragon really made a lot of people look.  Even something as simple as a game that uses cards instead of dice seemed to garner a lot of outside interest.  I imagine if you were playing something like Dread with it's Jenga thing you'd get a lot of people notice you (sound of collapsing tower aside).                        </div>

                            I have conquered and unconquered cons many times before and this is all good. Let me add one more thing: <br/><br/>Use "their" marketing. That is, find the mailing lists for your local RPGA or LARP or whatever has the signficant con presence (what? You don't know who has the significant con presence? You think you will conquer without intelligence??) and send out an e-mail specifically inviting them to specific games that will appeal to their interests (horror if it is a Vampire LARP that has the oomf, science fiction if it's a Trek club, dungeon crawls or fantasy if it's the RPGA.) That way when they get there they'll go "oh yeah, those guys!" <br/><br/>By the way: 'conquering'? Nyuk nyuk nyuk.                        </div>

                            I'm late to the party, but, in addition to what everybody else has already said:<br/><br/>1) Yes, make the focus on the games.  People, uh, don't care who you are.  They care what games they get to play.  Then they notice that you and your friends ran the best games at the con.  And then <em>next con</em> they seek you out.<br/><br/>2) Seed your games with players.  A game with no signups gathers no signups.  A game with one signup gathers more players.  At the strategicons, we did this by signing up for each other's games.  That, and we wanted to play each other's games, anyway.<br/><br/>3) Base camp is nice, but not strictly necessary.  On the other hand, we're hopefully getting some base camp action this next week, and I'm looking forward to it.  From past experience, it's hella convenient even if not necessary.<br/><br/>4) I touched on this above, but invading cons works best iteratively.  The first time out may not be super awesome.  The next time will be.  The time after that will rock on toast.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Hi Joe,<br/><br/>I'd put "playtest" in the titles as appropriate, since that is either a draw or a repellant and you want it to do both.<br/><br/>Do you have contact with the organizers? Are they supportive, hesitant, confused?<br/><br/>Since you've already got many sign-ups, I don't think you're going to have a hard time meeting people who share your enthusiasm. From a promotion angle, you might consider a related round-table or panel discussion on design or publishing. Something like that might get interested people together in the same room at least, and would serve as a catalyst for promoting play outside the con, make connections, and so forth.</blockquote>
Hey, Jason. Both the Polarpunk titles actually do say playtest in them, I just forgot to note that when I was typing them out here. Whoops.<br/><br/>One of the organizers actually posted to The Forge talking about a "host" of indie games. It was a bit of an empty promise because he wasn't planning to run any, but I then responded with "Great, I'll run this, and this, and this..."<br/><br/>I have contact with the Vancouver Gaming Guild (the con organizers, as well as central forum for Vancouver gamers), and they are enthusiastic. They loves them some Living Greyhawk, but are open-minded and enthusiastic about all gaming. Plus, I've extended an offer to volunteer at the next con and with their organization, so they are generally receptive to me.<br/><br/>The Vancouver Gaming Guild is very fantasy-oriented, as is Weathertop... Thus the two TSoY games. The GMs don't seem to be running that fantasy theme too concretely (there are games of Delta Green, Dread, etc), so I feel good about running non-fantasy games too (Polarpunk x2, Perfect).
<blockquote>2) Seed your games with players. A game with no signups gathers no signups. A game with one signup gathers more players. At the strategicons, we did this by signing up for each other's games. That, and we wanted to play each other's games, anyway.</blockquote>
Yeah, several people Already did this for me without asking. It's actually kind of sad, because only 1 person I don't know is in the Perfect slot, for example. My games were well seeded.<br/><br/>Thanks for all the positive feedback and useful tips guys! Feel free to keep it coming.                        </div>

                            It sounds like you are already on top of another point I forgot to mention - add value.  Make sure the con organizers know that not only will you and your crazy friends bring in paying attendees, but that you are both easy to work with and eager to help them be awesome.  Andy K and I try to do this locally at MACE by helping out with their "Game Chef" event, and by wrangling the "indie games" scheduling.  At this point we are a known quantity (for better or worse) and fill seats all weekend.  We're still working on some stuff, but overall I think our community has a positive reputation at this particular convention.                        </div>

                            It is worth pointing out that, though our games are fairly full, I don't think there's a total of more than 6 actual people signed up across them all. On the other hand, it doesn't seem like anyone else has bothered registering and signing up at all, so it's hard to say. <br/><br/>While we're at it though I'd love some feedback on my Dogs blurb, since frankly I think it's a little rambly, and it's surprisingly difficult to imagine what some gamer who has never even heard of Dogs needs to know to make an informed decision.<br/><br/><i>You are God's Watchdogs, religious and secular authorities charged with patrolling the frontier communities of the Faithful, religious folk who have gone West in search of a better life. But things are hard out on the frontier -- sin creeps in to every town, and where sin goes the demons soon follow. Can you make things right, or will you let the righteous suffer?<br/>Dogs in the Vineyard combines an innovative, narrative mechanic with an unusual, Western-influenced setting to put the power and responsibility of judgment square in the hands of the players. How far are you willing to go to see your judgement through? What will it cost to put these sins to rest? <br/>** No experience required. **</i><br/><br/>Unfortunately the con registration software (which is otherwise pretty slick) doesn't allow line breaks, so it looks more jumbled up than that.                        </div>

                            This'll be my first con, so I'm really excited/nervous.<br/>
<br/>
This is the pitch I posted for my game Kin:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kin (playtest) - 3 out of 5 spots remaining<br/>
<br/>
You just got a phonecall that said Grandpa died in a car crash. His funeral is going to be on Saturday, and everyone in the world you don't want to see is going to be there.<br/>
<br/>
Kin is a fast paced, emotionally engaging game about what it means to be a family. Take on the roles of estranged family members who have been called together for a family gathering. After so many years of being apart, you are suddenly brought face to face. Will you help pull everyone together, or will you be the force that tears everything apart? Kin is currently in playtest, so the ride may be a bit bumpy but you get to test out a new game system and your feedback will prove invaluable to the game's development.<br/>
<br/>
Amongst all the games there, I think Kin is one of the more 'out there' conceptually. It has very few fantastical elements at all!                        </div>
