You get to gehenna town or you fail to reach gehenna town kinda boring. If i'm doing a task based challenges ( I dont futz with the trap skill challenges where they exist) I keep them small as the book does. Something like You get to gehenna town or you get to gehenna town after a diversion (also known as a yes but) <br/><br/>The Original system failure dc's also were equal to half the successes btw. White the higher dc's definitely provided some if i contribute im pushing the failure button, and the 2x/x success to failure ratio did some odd things (like make smaller complexities more challenging because it was easier to get to the failure state ). I really feel they addressed it. <br/><br/>As for the remarks about it being dumb die rolling, like in more or less all of dnd, the not dumb parts are the parts that come from the interaction between players and the dm and more or less cannot be encoded, and only sometimes can cookies be given for them. The Tactical options that reward smart players is in the gm provodience of saying yes, listening to your players, making interesting scenarios, etc as apposed to being encoded into the skill challenge itself. <br/><br/>A little defense here, but when the compliants are ' its players rolling dice and hoping for high numbers' some times i wonder if were even playing the same game. Thats what dnd is, the so called tactical combat is that to, why would the skill challenge be any different?<br/><br/>Ps<br/>I've been considering allowing a player that rolls a failure the option of double downing, rerolling the same skill check with the same skill modifier but generating either two successes or two failures.  it would only apply to failed rolls, but its something closer to Stalkers system then I would normally consider ( I find stalkers system really smart , but too unwieldy and fiddly for me to consider implement in its entirety) <br/><br/>I hope this post has been helpful to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203649/#Comment_203649" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-27T07:53:47+00:00" title="April 27, 2009  7:53AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bent</cite>It's just dumb die rolling, unlike the combat, which at least has a lot of tactical options to reward smart players.</blockquote>\nI concur that there's not much in the way of tactical options, and so it seems pale in comparison to the combat activity.<br/><br/>I address this in two ways at my table:<br/><br/>* By pitching difficulties high, and letting players know the DCs are tough, they must spend time preparing for a test. Before letting an active player role dice, it helps to focus on the preparation. Don't just let people "roll to help", but make them justify their helping narratively: what are they doing to help? How are they helping?<br/><br/>* Discuss stakes and consequences of failure. I found this especially important, and is one of the things I put into practice when using BRP (Call of Cthulhu, actually) after some exposure to narrative games. What does failure mean? So you blew your Library Use roll; OK, you still reached found the information you wanted, but now you have these added complications you must address (you pissed of the librarian, it took you five hours instead of two, and so forth).<br/><br/>The second part can also be imposed upon the helping roll attempts: what are the consequences and complications from failing to assist in addition to getting/not getting the +2?<br/><br/>I have found that the hard part with skill challenges is that the table has a natural tendency to rush, and avoid engagement with the narrative activity. To my mind, this rushing is bolstered by the tactical combat where it's all about engagement with physical artifacts.<br/><br/>I have spent some time about trying to also inject physical artifacts into the skill challenges a bit: maybe a map-board and player pawns used some how, with the "skill challenge" sketched out as a story path or something, with stations along the way. It would have to be flexible enough to accommodate the narrative flow of the moment.<br/><br/>It's also possible that bringing an egg timer to the table might be useful. Figure out how long you want the skill challenge to be, roughly. Figure out how long you want each stage to take, game-time. For each stage, set the timer, and let the players know when it goes *ding* that's when you roll dice. Then, they have that much time to figure out how to meet the DC. Refuse to let the active player roll the dice before the *ding*.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203653/#Comment_203653" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-27T08:00:00+00:00" title="April 27, 2009  8:00AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bent</cite>I guess my question is, has anyone tried to develop their own 'social combat' system for 4e, to replace the half-assed system in place?

Better skill challenges take some prep, just like fighty encounters do. <br/><br/>Encourage the players to try weird things. Don't let them say, "I make a Diplomacy roll."

To take a Mouse Guard angle, maybe a "twist" on a failed skill check, which sends the conflict in a new direction, or at least requires some kind of special attention before continuing.  Hopefully it would create an "oh crap" moment, and would have players scrambling to form a new plan to deal with the obstacle or change of direction.<br/><br/>You could also assign secondary effects to the skill rolls, or change what effects they have on a conflict (like, "Successful Diplomacy grants a success and +2 on the next character's skill roll" or "Intimidate has no effect but to grant a -2 to further skill rolls" or "Successful History does nothing but give you an extra day to prepare for the quest").  I mean, they already do that, but each one is tailored to an individual challenge.  It might be nice to have a set of skill effects for Intrigue, Haggling, Chases, Survival, Travel, War, etc.  Then, if the players go into one of those conflicts, they have an idea of what their "tactics" might be.  The DM can still tweak things (with the player's foreknowledge or without), but at least everyone would start out on about the same page and perhaps not feel like they're flailing in the dark.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203696/#Comment_203696" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-27T11:23:03+00:00" title="April 27, 2009 11:23AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2009 11:34AM by viktor_haag.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ludanto</cite>I think skill challenges might benefit from having a more reactive element.

In execution, Skill Challenges aren't <i>that</i> much different from a series of Simple Contests in HeroQuest. In order to make the system "work" you'll need to set stakes and possible consequences, as well as adopt a "Yes But..." attitude to failure.<br/><br/>I mean, if you were to run HQ with task resolution, it would be just as bland. And both games present their systems as basically task resolution. But we all know (now) how HQ <i>should</i> be run and all the wonderful play that we can create by moving to conflict resolution, setting stakes and making failure interesting (not a blocker).<br/><br/>4e's Skill Challenges aren't that much different. In fact, about the only way I can see them as a workable and interesting mechanic is to apply pretty much everything I learned from playing and running HeroQuest and Mountain Witch.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that's not something that's spelled out in the text of the DMG. And it's not something that a lot of D&amp;D GMs are going to seek out. So, while I'd certainly run the holy mess out of a Skill Challenge, I'm not sure I'd want to play one (outside of the confines of a bonafide 4e Story Game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203731/#Comment_203731" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-27T14:27:10+00:00" title="April 27, 2009  2:27PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: smathis</cite>Unfortunately, that's not something that's spelled out in the text of the DMG.

You start with a central skill challenge, say, Knowledge (streetwise) to determine who to talk to about who deals the right kind of drugs in this town. If you succeed, you go on one side of the flowchart to another, more wide set of potential skill applications in figuring out what their strengths and weaknesses are. If you fail, you go on another side of the flowchart with another, more wide set of potential skill applications in finding out how you might go about identifying the person. <br/><br/>I think one thing that can be overlooked in our haste is that this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>the players are most effective by finding the PC highest relevant skill wrench their behaviour towards assisting that.</blockquote>\nis actually not a bad thing in a niche-protected game. If I am the guy with the super-high Knowledge (arcana) skill and we come across a skill challenge which is based around figuring out some magical doodad, effect or whatchamagoo, and I am NOT the guy in the spotlight for that skill challenge with everyone else pushing my awesomeness forward, well, what the hell do I have this super-high skill for anyway? In non-niche-protected games, it's no big deal if everyone is as good as everyone else and can contribute equally to everything. But that isn't D&amp;D.<br/><br/>In addition, there is one obvious and correct answer to this question:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Now that there's MORE rules surrounding skill challenges, why are players suddenly complaining that they're boring?</blockquote>\nAnd that is that GMs are cool and having one is awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/smathis" title="smathis"><img alt="smathis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/smathis">smathis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203801/#Comment_203801" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-28T05:51:13+00:00" title="April 28, 2009  5:51AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>Edited to add an appropriate hypertext link.</blockquote>\nThanks for sharing that Bill.

In general, all the pieces work.<br/><br/>From what I've seen, the world-building works really well, and gets players invested in what's going on. The hardest part is making that initial conceptual leap to be able to interpret the cards' images and motifs. I used the "Deck of Many Things" game accessory that you can pick up in game and comic shops, and so sometimes the images aren't necessarily a direct hit on the motifs associated with the deity they're paired with (e.g., Corellon as "Jester" seemed to throw the player who got it for a loop), but that's maybe an artifact of the weird polyglot cobbled-together pantheon of 4E D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Speaking of cobbled together, I've stolen stuff from lots of different places. The skillful recovery rule is cribbed from Stalker0's system, as is the general philosophy of the skill challenge rules. I've used them in play quite successfully. Skill challenges tend to produce these free-wheeling narrative romps that advance the action in time and space, letting the players essentially fast forward to the fight scenes. Blood tokens are from somewhere; I heard about them second-hand from a well-informed player and liked how they ameliorated the whiff factor. There was some grumbling about the original treasure tokens rule from a purist who thought that it might lead to the party being under-compensated and thus under-powered for its level. In the current version, at least you can say that if you have ten encounters at your level, you get 10 treasures at your level, which is how it's supposed to work. I have to add the action point rules, but it's safe to say I envision an expanded conception of that resource.<br/><br/>As far as prepping encounters goes, my practice was to have a menu of things I wanted to use, and just select from that menu as things moved forward. I also made up a generic monster table by type to make it easier to improvise (so for example, if I wanted a 4th level brute for an encounter, I could just look at the brute table, scan down the 4th level column, and note that it had 65 hp, made attacks vs. AC at +7 for 2d8+4 damage, and was AC 16. Other abilities could be added based on what it was -- a giant spider or a ninja might get free leaping ability, a lizard might get to hold with its bite, and so forth. Towards the end of a session, when things got further and further away from what I'd imagined would happen, cracking open the Monster Manual and "re-skinning" a monster of the appropriate level for the current encounter worked pretty well; for example, for a lich-like sorceror I used the stats for a baby red dragon and just changed the description of its powers. The main thing is to have sufficient familiarity with the MM to be able to pick and choose appropriately, but the modularity of monsters and their abilities makes that pretty easy to acquire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203816/#Comment_203816" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-28T08:07:28+00:00" title="April 28, 2009  8:07AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm building a 4E adventure right now, highly focused on Skill challenges.<br/><br/>Things I'm doing:<br/><br/>1) Skill Challenges lead to other Skill Challenges, Encounters, or Quests<br/><br/>First rule of skill challenges- never let it stop the adventure.  With that in mind, I make each pass/fail a split into other kinds of adventure.  This is not to say winning or losing doesn't matter, what it does mean is that they lead to -different- kinds of situations, and obviously the winning ones are generally more favorable, less of a hassle, delay the party less.  The lead-ins might not be immediate- a lot are loaded to play out a few sessions or later in a campaign for longer term play.<br/><br/>2) Skill Challenges shape the world<br/><br/>You saved the NPC with a Heal check from the crippling disease?  He goes on to become an awesome wizard and is hooking you guys up with magic items.  You failed in showing the Dwarves your regional drink?  It tastes like crap, but they THINK it's good, now you have to drink it everytime you visit them!  Good luck with those Endurance checks.<br/><br/>When players see the results start having lasting effects on the setting, they become more invested in success,  and the benefit/costs turn into a source of fiction and later adventure/situation ideas.<br/><br/>3) Split the Party<br/><br/>Extend your Skill Challenges time-wise- "In order to successfully negotiate with these guys, you're going to have to understand how they think and make a good impression.  Everyone pick an NPC to go hang out with at this party.  Good impressions make their way back to the Lord, just as much as bad ones..."<br/><br/>Players can try to strategize who can best impress which NPC (all of whom have 3-4 ways to do well by them), but you play the scene with each until it looks like it's going one way and call for a roll.<br/><br/>4) Auto failures, auto successes<br/><br/>The DMG mentions some things work as an autofailure (intimidating the king you're trying to get help from, for example), it makes sense that something might earn you an auto success, or 2 or even 3 successes when you make a good roll.  This is basically what I'm considering 4E's hack for Dogs in the Vineyard's Giving.  You say Yes or roll the dice.  Someone came up with something awesome, or perfect ("I'm using my ice magic to put out the burning house"), you give them a straight up success.  I never let it be possible to win a whole Skill Challenge this way, but you can get yourself a success or two with clever thinking.<br/><br/>If you tie the system to a few set skills and options, without considering the fiction, then it's really just a tree of dice rolling.  If you put the fiction first and base your DC's, success/failure options from that, flexibly, then it encourages players to strategize around fictional positioning,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203824/#Comment_203824" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-28T09:05:19+00:00" title="April 28, 2009  9:05AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timfire</cite><cite>Posted By: Bent</cite>I guess my question is, has anyone tried to develop their own 'social combat' system for 4e, to replace the half-assed system in place?

So I replaced it with a parallel combat system (a system that does work). Then converted skill challenges into a hit point based overlay that can exist in parallel with combat - conflicts, where each position has hit points which are worn down until skill attacks deal damage instead to the proponents of the position holding fast against their opposition. And when a position loses its hit points and its proponents, it is lost. And the last position standing is what occurs. <br/><br/>This part of my hack has been on my back burner up until a few days ago, but I'm starting to build some of the skill attack powers now. My first order of business is understanding what the different class roles mean in the context of a skill conflict.<br/><br/>My view so far is:<br/><br/>Controllers should limit the options of the conflict and participate in multiple conflicts at once. <br/><br/>Defenders should protect the positions they hold, rather than wear down the conflicts they oppose. <br/><br/>Leaders should be good at manipulating positions themselves, creating new ones or getting people to join or leave them. <br/><br/>Strikers should be good at hurting opposing positions and maneuvering among positions. <br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204037/#Comment_204037" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T00:45:18+00:00" title="April 29, 2009 12:45AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The current Dungeon and Dragons Podcast discusses skill challenges in some depth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204128/#Comment_204128" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T08:35:22+00:00" title="April 29, 2009  8:35AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just ran across <a href="http://robin-d-laws.livejournal.com/345728.html" rel="nofollow">this thing</a> that Robin Laws wrote on the topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204152/#Comment_204152" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T09:35:33+00:00" title="April 29, 2009  9:35AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2009 9:54AM by jenskot.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://media.gleemax.com/podcasts/DnD_20090429.mphttp://www.story-games.com/forums/extensions/BBInsertBar/buttons/text_align_center.gif3" rel="nofollow">Latest D&amp;D; podcast about skill challenges.</a> I really like that they answer fans questions and how friendly they generally are. It seems that they made this beautiful combat game and are trying to, possibly artificially, attach non combat story elements to it in place of freeform roleplaying. In the end skill challenges are mainly still freeform. They suggest changing the DCs to whatever you want and only use the DMG information as suggestions and using the history skill for appraising items and playing chess since the skill list is so limited. There is also some confusion between what the game promotes and how they like to play. They talk about not liking it from a story perspective when multiple characters are mainly focused on winning and try to maximize their use of aid another and trying to come up with story reasons to limit how aid another works. They essentially admit towards the end, to their credit and I appreciate their honesty, that this is new to them as well and that we are all right there with them trying to figure out how this should all work. I just wish they were presented as beta rules in the DMG as I know many people who have given up on them all together. But I think they are worth pursuing and I'm eager to see what they come up with.<br/>\n<br/>\nLately we've been experimenting with the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n- DM doesn't pre-prep skill challenges, they arise naturally and are attached to immediate player goals<br/>\n- DM chooses the complexity, the higher the complexity, the more XP the skill challenge is worth<br/>\n- for every level of complexity, the DM describes an obstacle in the fiction so that players actions have a concrete target<br/>\n- players describe what they do and why instead of what skills they use<br/>\n-DM decides which skill is appropriate, if the action is an auto success or an easy, moderate or hard difficulty<br/>\n-easy difficulties replace aid another and give a +2 to another skill check and failure count<br/>\n-moderate difficulties score 1 success<br/>\n-hard difficulties score 2 successes<br/>\n-success also expands the players options by creating opportunities for a greater variety of skill use<br/>\n-failure limits the players options by introducing new obstacles that can only be overcome with specific skills<br/>\n-if the players fail 3 rolls, they may continue at a price of 1 healing surge per additional roll<br/>\n-succeeding a skill challenge means the next encounter is 1 level lower, they catch the monsters unprepared, they earn an action point or a free re-roll<br/>\n-failing a skill challenge means the next encounter is 1 level higher or the monsters have time to prepare for them, the monsters earn an action point or a free re-roll                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204270/#Comment_204270" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T17:40:27+00:00" title="April 29, 2009  5:40PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I generally don't create skill challenges in advance.

To the point where I'm building powers and generalized rituals which will let players directly introduce them. If you want to bring down the Slaver's Guild in town, a good first step could be the Fighter starting a Brawl with some of their "recruiters", followed by a rescue Event (basically a player initiated adventure frame-work). Meanwhile, the Slavers might be trying to interfere with the construction of the Warlord's new keep, as an act of revenge or something more, which acts as a parallel conflict. <br/><br/>In any case, the different conflicts would give the controllers a chance to be very subtle affecting things behind the scenes. While controllers are good at making things flexible in this skill challenge, their plans always run deeper.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204582/#Comment_204582" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T18:51:46+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  6:51PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have been using some "freeform" skill challenges.<br/><br/>The part our group found most "distancing for player engagement" was the pre-selection of what skills could be used.  It felt like being told "okay now it's Ralph's turn to shine, and Ralph here is what you do, now roleplay it".<br/><br/>So we reverse engineered, instead of DM choosing 3 Primary Skills, DM describes situation and then Players say what they're doing and what skill that is, and 3 can end up Primary, with limits on how many Opened, etc.  Players can't introduce same skill at Primary twice in row and other rules to encourage diversity (a bonus for using a skill not used in past 3 challenges).  I tend to go with the tougher pre revision DC"s with Keith Baker's notes including letting powers be used and action points.  This combines with some narrative liberty/authority granted PC's in the course of the challenge.<br/><br/>So far, I've found this works well for "shorter round, pass fail in 4/2 or so" challenges but the "structure of the reverse engineered" process overshadows roleplaying in longer challenges.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204667/#Comment_204667" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T07:43:44+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  7:43AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel Levine has run some most excellent D&amp;D games for me and friends over the last few months. We've tried a couple different things for skill challenges. I was hoping he'd pipe up and talk about it, so I wouldn't steal his thunder, but here's me absconding with the lightning noise.<br/><br/>In skill challenges that I have run in the past, it did sort of devolve into going around the table in a circle, asking each player how he or she was contributing. Everyone was expected to find a way to help. Players often min-maxed and really stretched the fiction thin to get their best skills into play. The role-playing was weak. I think the structure I was using failed to create a comfortable environment for freeform role-play.<br/><br/>Daniel's skill challenges were another story. In one challenge, he provided a giant map. It was a sort of high level representation of the deep underground area we were exploring, but the challenge was a chase scene. The map was a node-and-edge form, not a real map. We knew that the nodes represented new challenges that might actually be new places. We knew the edges represented ways to get from this challenge to that challenge. At each node, Daniel described our situation. It might be a combat challenge. It might be a trap or hazard. Sometimes we got to choose (sneak around the crypt wardens or fight them?). Each area called for different skills. Sometimes it was obvious that my character, the one with a decent Thievery skill, should be the one to go mess with the weird machinery. It wasn't an "around the table" kind of thing. It worked well, though we didn't role-play as much as we should have.<br/><br/>In another challenge, Daniel winged it entirely. He had some ideas in his head. Our party had to cross a desert, meet and perhaps help various factions along the way, and deal with other obstacles such as a giant ravine and a magical force field. Making nice with the factions was nice, because we rolled their forces into our "army" that we were accumulating (the final encounter was an army-scale battle using One Bad Egg's "Hard Boiled Armies" rules, and it RAWWWWKED). In the encounters, as quickly as we could figure out things to try, we suggested them. There was no "around the table" order. We role-played. Each player described what we were trying to do. We interacted with each other and with NPCs. We started with the fiction, much of the time, and figured out which skill matched up with our attempt. Sure, there was a certain amount of optimization -- we know our characters' strengths -- but the stuff had to make sense in the fiction. Much of the time, the party got split up. Since I was casting the Shadow Bridge ritual with the shaman's help, that meant that the apelord and the fighter ended up meeting the ancient bullywug spirits. Sure, the two brawny types weren't great at diplomacy, but they did all right.<br/><br/>In all of these challenges, Daniel kept quiet (but transparent) track of successes and failures. We actually failed the latter challenge (three failures before ten successes), but Daniel didn't let that bring the story to a grinding halt. Instead, he asked us what we'd give up for it. Since I had botched two of those failures, I offered up a holy symbol magic item and Daniel converted our failure into a new setback.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L" title="Dave L"><img alt="Dave L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L">Dave L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204672/#Comment_204672" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T07:49:36+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  7:49AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The skill challenges I've run have been pretty good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI make sure that I use conflict resolution when running them, though.
