(Or we just slaughter aliens, which is fun too.)<br/><br/>Still, there are some questions that came up:<br/><br/>1. Movement in combat.<br/><br/>If Trooper rolls a success before the opposition, he gets to change range by one step at the end of the round. This seems to be true for the Aliens too. So far so good. But does that mean that every Trooper that rolls before the Aliens can change range or just the first one? Also, how exactly does the Aliens moving work? Let's say I have a some Troopers at Close and some at Far, with the Alien rolling a success before them all. They all get a kill and then the Alien moves away one step. What range are the troopers at now? Is one half now at near and the other "off the map"? Can those beyond Far still rejoin combat or are they out of the encounter? Can they still be affected by Alien successes?<br/><br/>Alternatively, if the aliens move closer, I guess the Close Troopers would stay Close but the Far Troopers would now be Near?<br/><br/>Also, can Aliens try to switch range like Troopers do with a NFA success, with a successfull AA roll? <br/><br/>2. Frustrating Encounters<br/><br/>Looking through the special abilities, one could easily make some encounters that aren't all that dangerouns, but that are really frustrating. I'm looking at Flee, End Enounter, or Leaping. I'm trying to decide whether something like that would be really, really fun as the players really start to hate these annoyingly slippery bugs that keep getting away (For some reason, I'm seing space rabbits, here...) or whether it would just be anticlimatic.<br/>Anybody tried this yet?<br/><br/>3. Field Promotion<br/><br/>The "Field Promotion" box talks about how Field Promotion only works when the highest level PC dies, yet the "Becoming the Brigadier" box talks about becoming Brigadier as part of a Field Promotion. Is this an oversight and the intention is that it's also possible to become field promoted when NPCs die? Or is the Brigadier a special case?<br/><br/>4. Strength and Weaknesses<br/><br/>It says that Strength can't be used in response to a Weakness but I guess a Trooper could still use a strength to end the endounter later, after the use of the Weakness has removed himself from the enounter. Or is it that by using a Weakness, the other troopers are now locked out of using their strength altogether for this encounter?<br/><br/>5. Downloads<br/><br/>Are there downloads somewhere of stuff like the Character sheets or the range map? Some of the GM sheets would be usefull to print out too. <br/><br/>------------------<br/><br/>Weeeelll, that's it for now I guess. You know, I think this game could be really fun and the best thing about it is that it looks like it could work on a "Hey, we have nothing to do, let's make some 3:16 characters and kill some aliens!" basis. Low prep is good.<br/><br/>M                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196239/#Comment_196239" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T06:18:18+00:00" title="March  9, 2009  6:18AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are many useful downloads linked on the <a href="http://gregorhutton.com/boxninja/threesixteen/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">3:16 page</a>.<br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196241/#Comment_196241" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T06:54:23+00:00" title="March  9, 2009  6:54AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doing my best here:<br/><br/>1. You are correct: moving away pushes Close troopers to Near and Far troopers to out-of-the-encounter. They can't get back in. Once you're out, you're out, and the aliens can't hurt you.<br/>Yes, moving closer pushes Near troopers to Close and keeps Close troopers at Close.<br/>Aliens cannot use AA to do everything that NFA does, only the stuff that's listed under what AA can do.<br/><br/>2. I see two potential tactical uses. The first is trying to split up the group before turning around to launch a counter-attack. The second is ending encounters in a way that negates some kills that are about to occur.<br/><br/>3. I think the text about the Brigadier is there to suggest a way for the campaign to jump, err, "off the rails" a bit.<br/><br/>4. You can still use a Strength even if someone else used a Weakness earlier in the encounter. "A Strength can't be used in response to a Weakness" is talking about how a Strength can't preempt/interrupt a Weakness but a Weakness <i>can</i> preempt/interrupt a Strength. So, in a player-vs.-player conflict, I can use a Weakness in response to you from totally kicking my ass with a Strength -- my ass is still well and thoroughly kicked, but on my own terms (e.g. still alive).<br/>If it makes sense to you, perhaps it's also possible to game Weaknesses to interrupt Strengths during encounters as well, kinda like "Okay, I'll use my Strength to take out the last token. Another d100 kills for me!" "Nu-uh. I'm going to use a Weakness to make that token disappear before you can get rid of it." (the Strength still occurs but now no tokens are removed so no kills are scored) -- I'd be cool with that.<br/>When we played, I found that the ability to remove a token when you use a Weakness was actually pretty damn helpful, by the way.<br/><br/>-- Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196246/#Comment_196246" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T07:44:31+00:00" title="March  9, 2009  7:44AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gregor Hutton</cite>There are many useful downloads linked on the<a href="http://gregorhutton.com/boxninja/threesixteen/index.html" rel="nofollow">3:16 page</a>.<br/><br/>Thanks!</blockquote>Wohooo!

The players tried to use it strategically against each other.<br/><br/>I won only one Dominance roll and used that to set the range to Far, which allowed me to successfully boot two out of three PCs in the first round. The last one then hung on racking up kills until the aliens were about to escape, at which point she finished the encounter with a Strength. The guys who were out weren't out long enough to be frustrated, though one did lament missing the opportunity to Force Weakness.<br/><br/>Right now, I think my friends generally look favorably upon any event that ends an encounter, because it ends up healing the group. The fact that it was very easy to safely exit an encounter by just allowing the aliens to push you off the map seemed to strengthen their resolve. Maybe they would react differently if they were more kill-happy and backstabby than survival-oriented. Or maybe they would react differently if I used Leaping to twist the knife into them.

Today we finally got to play, so we all got our first taste of 3:16. I might put up a longer Actual Play tomorrow, but here are some snippets:<br/><br/>Fun was had by all. Learning the rules was a bit slow (Too much looking things up on my part, etc.) and we did start somewhat late, but even so we finished the planet in about two hours. (So with a somewhat longer session, we could have fit in at least one other planet.)<br/><br/>The Planet I rolled up was a Humid Planet called Titian, filled with Swarm-ing Plant-Aliens with an AA of 6, and I used the good old "We lost contact with our base on the planet, so let's go there and kill some things", along with a heavy dose of sorta Vietnam. (Lotsa jungle and swamp.) I felt really rusty at first (I hadn't GM-ed in ages.) but play became smoother as things went on, even though the humor was ... really, really bad. In a good way. But still bad. ^_^ <br/><br/>(For example, the planet was very soon called "Planet Assrape" and the tentacle-jokes flowed freely after I narrated vines and roots attacking the troopers.)<br/><br/>The Sergeant pretty much owned the planet, kill-wise, despite having the lowest FA, through well-placed grenade use, while the final conflict was won by the Corporal using a strength. The former was promoted, while the Corporal got a Medal and a Rocker Launcher for her troubles. (She also got all shiney-eyed when i told her that that thing is just two Improvements away from d100 kills.) Our lone Trooper didn't get many kills, but at least he got a level. (Which he promptly used to get even better at killing, with a new FA of 9.)<br/><br/>All in all the planet was surprisigly easy (Although with an AA of 6, I should have expected that, I guess.) and would have been even without two players using their strength, although I also rolled pretty badly. ^_^ <br/><br/>Fazit: Great fun, we can't wait until next week.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
