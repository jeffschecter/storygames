You fail your skill-check in <i>Fabula</i> and is not able to defend yourself against the overwhelming feeling of fear; the leader rules that your mind is cast into a shocked state of insanity, but treatment is at hand; you are taken to an asylum<br/><br/>2. You are taunted by some cynical NPC into screaming and shouting, and you share the frustration of the character, shouting at the leader of the game. The reactions of the crowd is logical; people looks at you as a crazy man; the leader rules that they overwhelm you, and brings you to an asylum for treatment<br/><br/>3. You are faced with a monster so abysmal in nature that your mind cannot cope with it; the leader rules that you are going insane by the mere presence of the monster, and is left babbling on the ground, and that someone picks you up and takes you to an asylum.<br/><br/>All of these are viable options in a game, and fun to play. Each of them will come with it's own set of reactions in a player, and each set of reactions brings its own possibilities for interesting follow-up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390860/#Comment_390860" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-20T02:50:41+00:00" title="September 20, 2012  2:50AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Is there any appreciable difference between these situations:<br/>1 You fail a move in an AW hack and the GM rules that your PC appeared to lose its shit to the extent that it has been taken to an asylum<br/>2.

This is really significant. Players hate not getting a roll.<br/><br/>And the game system makes a difference. In Apocalypse World, I don't mind being carted off to an asylum, because the game is freeform enough that I'll get out soon. In Call of Cthulhu, I'll have to make endless rolls to get out, which I might fail.

The social contract will be much of the answer to how the thing is perceived and how it feels.<br/><br/>1. Is it whitin the social contract acceptable when playing the AW hack that that is one of the sort of hard moves that is acceptable?<br/><br/>2. Is it whitin the social contract acceptable when playing the a freeform game that the GM has the kind of narrative control over the PC? <br/><br/>3. Is it whitin the social contract acceptable when playing Call of Cthulhu that a failed sanity roll can have that effect?<br/><br/>Here I think acceptable means: That people are aware before it happens that kind of turn of events outside their control might happen, and that they feel okay with this possibility and feel that is a positive aspect of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390864/#Comment_390864" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-20T03:55:25+00:00" title="September 20, 2012  3:55AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2012 3:56AM by Johnstone.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a player?<br/><br/>1. If I think that insanity and institutionalization is a logical result of me missing a particular roll, then I don't have a problem with it. There are two possible problems here, though: What if the GM thinks I should go insane and I don't? Also, what if the scale and scope of the move is small and intimate, maybe part of a conversation with the preacher's daughter and she mentions something and the pieces fall together in my mind, and I miss a roll, and suddenly I'm in a padded room? It feels incongruous, shouldn't we keep role-playing the conversation with me reeling around the parlor?<br/><br/>Actually there might be a third problem: Drive Them Mad and Capture Them would be two different hard moves, and it might not seem reasonable to double-down on a PC for one miss. If the hard move is just Capture Them, and it's because people think the PC is crazy, cool. If the move makes him crazy and that has, like, game effects and stuff, maybe both at once is a bit harsh.<br/><br/>2. If I know this is a possibility before I start playing the game, cool beans. If not, I will probably be not impressed. Partly because divisions of narrative authority were not explained and just assumed, but also because if we're assuming stuff, based on the most common assumptions of rpg players, this is invasive authority on the part of the GM.<br/><br/>3. This one, though. It is NOT COOL to complain about this situation. It's clearly labelled a Sanity roll, the stakes are clearly communicated and anybody who has a problem with Sanity rolls should know not to play this game. If you fail, you should go insane, definitely. I fully expect the GM to institutionalize my PC after a failed Sanity roll.<br/><br/>So yes, completely different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_390866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390866/#Comment_390866" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-20T04:57:16+00:00" title="September 20, 2012  4:57AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice question Steve.  My response to your examples is:<br/><br/>1. As a player in any sort of AW setting I don't mind failing a roll.  There is an implicit contract in the game that if I fail a roll then it's the MC's turn to shift things on.  Being in the asylum will mean that stuff is likely to happen.<br/><br/>2. If it's something very freeformy with folk I know then OK, I can roll with it.  If it's people I don't know in a task resolution based system I might get narky.<br/><br/>3.  This sounds like classic Call of Cthulhu territory, which I'm not that OK with because I've sat in games and the insanity just feels like a punishment, not a mechanism to move the story on.  I'm sure there are CoC Keepers out there who will actively do something with the insanity but I've yet to play in a game with one.  I do like Dorward's Hot War Cthulhu hacks though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390874/#Comment_390874" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-20T05:43:46+00:00" title="September 20, 2012  5:43AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2012 7:11AM by GB_Steve.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Well.

You fail a move, the GM takes your elephant off you (move not necessarily directly related to elephant handling).<br/>2. The GM sees that you're not looking after your elephant properly and takes your elephant off you.<br/>3.

In 1, you <i>chose</i> to try that move, knowing that failure might make you appear to lose your shit. The GM can't tell you to make that move, so if you didn't want to, you didn't have to.<br/><br/>In 3, you were <i>told</i> to make a Sanity check and take the consequences if you failed: you didn't choose to do it yourself.<br/><br/><br/>Anyway, I'd say yes to GB_Steve's questions: there's an appreciable difference between those, even though they all end up in the same (potentially game-ending?) place.<br/><br/>1 is the most benign of the lot, since it's the one that starts with the player's choice to take on that risk (since the move can potentially at least have insanity/institutionalization as an explicit consequence of failure -- if it doesn't, this basically shares the same problems as 2). 3's the next best, since the player at least gets a chance to avoid the bad stuff and stay in the game (and CoC sanity losses were rarely so high that a player could go to zero SAN in a single roll, so you could modify your play to stave that moment off a little while longer). 2 depends so heavily on who the player and the GM are that it could go either way; maybe the player knows and expects the PC to get carted off and that's perfect for the game, maybe the GM's just being an asshole, who can say for sure?<br/><br/>If I was playing with strangers -- which doesn't happen in real life, so this is mostly a guess -- I'd probably take 1 or 3 over 2 any day. If I was playing with my friends, I might choose 1 or 3 just for the gameplay aspect (it's fun to roll dice and see what happens), but I'd be cool with 2.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390893/#Comment_390893" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-20T06:56:08+00:00" title="September 20, 2012  6:56AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the reason why <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> might not sit well is the jump all the way to the asylum, without playing to see what happens in between.

It seems like it should be, but maybe not. Hmm.<br/><br/>1 feels like it'd be more like gambling to me: if I know that choosing to do this move might mean losing my character to the asylum or a sad elephantless existence or whatever, I'm only going to do it if I really need that move AND I'm pretty sure I can win. I know the odds going in and I'm ready to accept the consequences if I fail. That's fairly satisfying all the way around.<br/><br/>3 feels like the game itself is pushing back on my character. Did I make a mistake opening that door? Could I have done something more to prevent this sanity loss? Am I just unlucky? This isn't necessarily a bad thing -- Call of Cthulhu's atmosphere pretty much demands that the world feel dangerous and not under the control of the characters. Satisfying in the right kind of game, definitely.<br/><br/>2 feels like it still depends on the specific situation. Maybe getting hauled off to the asylum is what makes sense and I'm all for it, or maybe I just think that the GM is being a jerk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390902/#Comment_390902" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-20T07:51:27+00:00" title="September 20, 2012  7:51AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right - I guess what I'm trying to say is that as a GM I would <i>expect</i> players to feel uncomfortable, powerless, or annoyed by a jump forward to the asylum, but a hard move that preserves the flow of the fiction and sets up future badness would feel exciting and cool.

AW also has the requirement that something interesting will happen when a player makes a move. <br/>This means that players know there is a potentially bad consequence to making any move and so making<br/>moves is not done lightly.<br/><br/>OTOH *if* everyone is on board then a normal GM can also make very hard moves and it will be OK.<br/>It is just that this is very far from most people's normal play (cf if everyone is on board).<br/><br/>Basically as long as everyone is on the same page, bad things can happen and everyone is cool with that.<br/>AW is one way of framing the page.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391001/#Comment_391001" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-21T06:10:40+00:00" title="September 21, 2012  6:10AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve,<br/><br/>It's because "being carted off to the asylum" has different implications in different games.
