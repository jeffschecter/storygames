That's okay, it happens in board games, too.<br/><br/>A chess newbie who tries to move a rook diagonally is corrected by the more experienced chess-player. That situation might be discouraging or enlightening, depending on the personality of both the newbie and the veteran. It could make the difference whether the newbie becomes an enthusiastic chess-evangelist or a chess-reject. (I've met both, personally.)<br/><br/>So, even in an RPG without a GM, there is still often one player who hasn't played much, and one who has played more than the others. When I was playing Shab-al-Hiri Roach at GenCon last year, there was definitely some facet of the "GM" role as one of the players taught me the rules n' stuff. It faded after the group became acclimated to the system, but it was there briefly.<br/><br/>I'm just wondering if there is some deeper analysis of this "default GM" role. If there is some practical advice for would-be default GMs, that'd be awesome. Just coming straight out and saying:\n<blockquote>"Hey, you bought this game, so you're probably going to have to teach your friends how to play. Here are some tips on how to teach them."<br/><br/>Tip 1: ...<br/><br/>Tip 2: ...<br/><br/>Tip 3: ...<br/><br/>...</blockquote>\nHell, writing it from that perspective might make the regular rules text more clear, too. Rather than teaching the reader how to play, you're teaching the reader how to teach <i>others</i> how to play. You've got a cool setting and a cool system, so the reader will inevitably become a champion for your game. You can arm that champion with the tools to instill the same enthusiasm in his or her friends. Kinda like viral marketing, actually. Neat.<br/><br/>So yeah, is there anything like that trundling about on discussion forums or existing games? I've heard the term "alpha player" in passing, is that the same thing here?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77061/#Comment_77061" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-22T05:01:16+00:00" title="June 22, 2007  5:01AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 22, 2007 5:02AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I call that facilitation, myself, and often fall into that role, especially with my own games.  Notes on how to do it effectively, included in the rules, is a great idea, because it is something that happens in GMless games until everybody is up to speed.  You see it happen in regular GM'd games as well, if there's a player who has more experience with the system - that person might drive play and set the tone a bit.  Oh!

"I love the feeling when I win," he says. "It would be great if I could become a professional player in the future."<br/><br/>Schoolboys across Japan have similar aspirations \xe2\u20ac\u201d an inexplicable development given that Ito's generation was reared on fast-twitch Nintendo duels. <br/><br/>...<br/><br/>For the Shueisha publishing house, producers of Hikaru No Go, building a story around a game that moves at the speed of rice germinating was a gamble. "Not many kids can relate to Go," says a company spokesman. "It's not like soccer or baseball. There weren't many positives when we launched the series." Nevertheless, 7.5 million copies of the comic have been sold in Japan to readers wanting a glimpse into the cloistered world of professional Go players.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Hikaru's exploits are carefully monitored by his young fans, who consume the series as they would an instruction manual with a plot. "I learned the basics of the game from the comic," says devotee Ito. Now he routinely beats his father, but still has lots to learn about sophisticated strategies. "It will be difficult for [Ito] to become a professional," says his mother. "But I'm not against him trying. Even if he doesn't become pro, he can have fun."</blockquote>\nWell damn, there you go.

I've no idea how successful the product is, but it seems like a great idea at least.<br/><br/>The more relevant comment he made was that learning by teaching was a great way to transmit game-information.<br/><br/>I suggested a corrolary: <b>If a game is too hard to teach, it's probably too hard to learn.</b><br/><br/>Of course, that's like saying "A is A" since the act of teaching by definition involves a second party learning whatever information the teacher is giving out. If there is no learning, there isn't any teaching. You know what I mean though. If you can't make the system easy enough for your potential teachers to internalize, it'll be that much more difficult to spread its popularity.<br/><br/>I'm wondering what the gaming podcasters on the forum have to say about this, since many reviewers like Paul Tevis spend their time describing and teaching games verbally, without any visual aids.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
