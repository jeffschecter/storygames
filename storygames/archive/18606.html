I decided would be using the Demo rules (<a href="http://starlinepublishing.com/golden-sky-stories-tabletop-day-2013-demo/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://starlinepublishing.com/golden-sky-stories-tabletop-day-2013-demo/</a>) but open up all the currently available henge types and their powers. The thing is, for those unfamiliar - instead of having "Connections" with other characters, that element is just sort of squished down into a simpler "Friendship" system. Which is good - this will be a one-shot and I'm unlikely to run a campaign of GSS for awhile yet, so I don't need to complicate things by tracking something that won't come up again. And it's nicer to give people a link to the demo to study in advance and not change things up on them beyond giving them a list of more to choose from.<br/><br/>The thing is that some powers and weaknesses use Connections to work. (Especially the Rabbit.) On the plus side, I was able to use some of the modifications of powers in the Demo version of the game to compare it to the full game and get ideas. But it's not always so simple.<br/><br/>Here are my current solutions. I didn't include the ones that were pretty straight forward ("Just roleplay this. No mechanical changes." or "Change Connections to Friendship.") or the ones that were already given official modifications in the Demo book.<br/><br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fox</span></b>:<br/>(Weakness) Secret - You have a very strict rule against letting people see your true form. If someone does see your full fox form, your connections to both that person and the town lose 1 strength. (Houserule: In oneshots, lose 1 Friendship.)<br/><br/>(Weakness) Pride - You take an arrogant attitude towards humans and other henge. When others want to increase their connection to you, it costs them an extra 2 Dreams. (Houserule: In oneshots, you and the other party each lose 1 Dream whenever your pride upsets someone who is obviously trying to be friendly.)<br/><br/>(Weakness) Cold - You have difficulty showing emotions, and you come off as cold. Reduce the strength of connections from others gained by Impression Checks by 1. (Houserule: In oneshots, your Henge starts the game with 2 Friendship instead of 4.)<br/><br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tanuki</span></b>:<br/>(Additional Power) Stomach Worm (8) - When your stomach is empty, you can make it emit a soothing rumbling sound. When finishing one scene without eating anything, you can use this power during the next scene. If anyone present has a Protection, Affection, or Family connection to you, you can increase their connection to you to by 1 (to a maximum of 4). (Houserule: During oneshots, all who hear this sound and are charmed/amused by it gain 2 Dreams.)<br/><br/>(Weakness) Teasing - You like to tease people all the time. You get blamed for most of the strange incidents around the town, and because of that, your connection from the town can\u2019t go above 2. (Houserule: In oneshot games, your Henge starts with 2 Friendship instead of 4.)<br/><br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cat</span></b>:<br/>(Weakness) Selfish - You\u2019re very independent and moody. Even if you and someone else have Connections of 5 to each other, you\u2019ll still only get 5 points of Feelings/Wonder each. (Houserule: In oneshot games, your Henge starts the game with 2 Friendship instead of 4.)<br/><br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dog</span></b>:<br/>(Additional power) Home (0) - At the start of each story, you have a connection with your master with a strength of 2 each way. You can only raise this connection after a scene where your master has appeared. Please discuss with the narrator the kind of person your master is. (Houserule: You can gain an extra Friendship during intermission if your master appeared in the previous scene and interacted with you.) <br/><br/>(Additional Power) I Love Everyone (0) - You truly love the whole world from the bottom of your heart. You start each story with a connection to \u201cLove For Everyone\u201d at a strength of 3. (You do not get a connection back.) You can only raise this special connection at the end of a story. Also, if the Narrator approves, you may well be able to start a connection from \u201cEveryone.\u201d (Houserule: In oneshots, you start the game with 5 Friendship instead of 4.)<br/><br/>(Weakness) Scary - You are a scary dog with a large body, and perhaps a fearsome bark. When you make Impression Checks, the strength of the other person\u2019s connection to you is reduced by 1. However, this only applies to people you\u2019re meeting for the first time, so you can make a normal Impression Check if you have a Thread to that person. (Houserule: When meeting someone for the first time in your animal form, other characters must make a Surprise check, even if they have met you before as a "human".)<br/><br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rabbit</span></b>:<br/>(Basic Power) Cute (0) - You have a certain charm that makes everyone find you cute and loveable. The cost in Dreams for others to strengthen a connection to a rabbit is reduced by 1. (Houserule: For oneshots, if in the previous scene, you participated and were "cute", you may purchase 1 Friendship for 9 Dreams instead of 10. Additional purchases cost the usual 10.)<br/><br/>(Basic Power) Lop-Eared (3) - By letting your ears droop, you can look depressed and get others around you to worry about you. You can only use this when you\u2019ve failed a check. When you use this power, you can gain Feelings equal to the strength of your connection from one other person who is currently in the same scene. (Houserule: For oneshots, when you use this power, you gain Feelings equal to your Friendship score -1.)<br/><br/>(Additional Power) Friendship (0) - You\u2019re good at getting to know people, and you're naturally lovable. Reduce the cost to strengthen you connections to others by 1 Dream. (Houserule: If you've got to know someone in the previous scene, you can buy 1 Friendship for 8 Dream instead of the usual 10. You can use this in combination with the Houserule for "Cute", otherwise additional Friendship costs 10 Dream as usual.)<br/><br/>(Additional Power) I Love You! (12) - By proactively appealing to the person you love, you can heighten the feelings between the two of you. This raises the strength of a connection from someone else to you by 1. You can only use this power on a given partner once per story. (Houserule: For oneshots, you and your beloved each gain 1 Friendship.)<br/><br/>(Weakness) Meddling - You can\u2019t help but stick your nose into other people's business. You\u2019re too sympathetic to others problems and tend to adopt their way of thinking. Whenever you\u2019re in a scene with someone who has a connection to the person to whom you have your strongest connection, the contents of your connection will change to become the same as that other person\u2019s. (Houserule: For oneshots, pick one character you are "closest" to and take particular interest in their interactions with others - even if it means taking the other person's side against the person you're "closest" to. You may change the person you are "closest" to during intermission.)<br/><br/>(Additional Power) Remember (6) - You can make it so that you and someone you\u2019ve met have previous memories together. This lets you increase the strength of a connection someone makes to you via an Impression Check by 1. (Houserule: For oneshots, you may use this power once per scene to add one Friendship.)<br/><br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bird</span></b>:<br/>(Basic Power) Down Pillow (12) - By embracing someone with your downy feathers, your hearts become closer. This strengthens that person\u2019s connection to you by 1. However, you can only use this power while you have wings, and you can only use it on a given person once per story. (Houserule: For oneshots, each of you gains 1 Friendship.)<br/><br/>(Weakness) Distant - You are distant from the mundane world, and you think differently from humans. The required result for Impression Checks goes up by 2 for both you and people making connections to you. (Houserule: In oneshots, your henge starts the game with 2 Friendship instead of 4.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Weaknesses and Additional powers I could NOT figure out houserules for:<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fox</span></b>: Marriage Knot<br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dog</span></b>: Shy <i>and</i> I Believe in You<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thoughts and assistance?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
