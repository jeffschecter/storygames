                    In my ideal gaming competition...<br/><br/>1. You'd use four random words to spark the contest, as with Game Chef and the Ronnies, because it's fun and stops you planning in advance.<br/><br/>2. Everything would be submitted in .txt format, so there was no doubt about whether good graphic design influenced the judging. All you'd see would be the game text. And ASCII art would be banned.<br/><br/>3. The judging rules would be published in advance, so you knew what you were designing for. I remember, say, Jason's Owlbear Challenge. I decided, as an exercise, to write a very simple text without pretty layout, to get myself out of the habit of using pretty fonts to spice the game up. Then I found the games were being judged on Beauty and, well, got knocked on it. That's not specific to the Owlbear thing, of course, but it's nice to know what you're being judged on.<br/><br/>4. There'd be a playtesting phase. We talk about playtesting all the time, and how important it is, so we should really shove it into the competitions somewhere. Perhaps you'd do a design, and then the designs would be randomly assigned for playtesting, and then revised. <br/><br/>5. While we're at it, all the games would have their roots in Actual Play in some sense. You'd design a game around something you'd seen in a play session: so, for example, I might design a game to try and recapture that feeling I'd had playing Paranoia as a teenager; you might design a game to play at those sessions when you've only got three people because everyone else cancelled. That kind of thing.<br/><br/>6. Everyone would be nice at all times. All reviews would be nice. Comments like "Well, I can't say I'm too impressed",  "All the designer seems to have done..."  or "This is just a mess" wouldn't happen. Constructive criticism would be encouraged - especially if it went through the game, point by point, and identified flaws - but subjective judgements wouldn't be. Unless they were nicely expressed: "This isn't my thing, but it's done very well."<br/><br/>7. Games would be marked on how good they could potentially be (after revision), rather than playability. One thing I worry about is that game competitions reward playable games developed in limited periods of time. And who develops playable games in limited periods of time? Well, experienced game designers, of course, or newcomers who use an established game model and tweak it a bit. My problem is, here, that all the competition entries I enjoy most are the ones that aren't <i>quite</i> playable but have fascinating parts to them; but the ones that win are solid, playable games. <br/><br/>8. There's also be a mark for how innovative the mechanics were. Because the games I like are the ones that take risks, even if they don't quite hang together: and it's sad that those games don't often get far in competitions.<br/><br/>8a. In fact, no, sod it, there's be no marks out of ten, because it's really quite sad to find a review which scores your game 2/10. Instead, games would be rated in terms of preferences. You'd divide the games up, and ask people: between Game A and Game B, which game would you prefer to win? Then you'd use those preferences to work out finalists and a winner. <br/><br/>9. Oh, and there'd be a dedicated forum, like with Game Chef, because it works really well and creates a community atmosphere.<br/><br/>10. In that dedicated forum, everyone would be nice and happy and would give detailed, incredibly useful feedback on each other's games. <br/><br/>11. Examples of play would be banned, because my examples of play always make my games seem much better than they actually are. <br/><br/>12. After a year, the competition would run again with the same entries, to see how they'd been revised after playtesting.<br/><br/>Most of this is bollocks, of course, and there are various things (like marking how good games could potentially be) that I don't <i>entirely</i> mean. <br/><br/>But it has its roots in a few worries about gaming competitions: not least that, while we talk about the importance of actual play and playtesting, competitions generally reward quick design without testing. Does it spark any thoughts? Am I talking out of my arse? Is there anything that you'd definitely put into  / leave out of your ideal game competition?<br/><br/>Graham                </div>

                            Good layout is good layout.  You can do good layout in TXT, with no ASCII art (actually most ASCII art would make it worse), just though regular use of headings and proper division of the text into readable chunks. If you're gonna try not to judge games on presentation at all... I think that ways lies madness.                        </div>

                            4, 7 &amp; 8 are superb ideas, even though they all potentially clash with each other.<br/><br/>6- of course, except for that upside-down competition in which reviews are rated rather than the games, with awards for the most scurrilous, the most devastating, the most clueless.  <br/><br/>I'd have to disagree with 11, since I like writing &amp; reading the sample game parts better than the mechanics parts.<br/><br/>And number 1 grows old. I don't mind it once a year, but I like variety on the 'ingredients' side: reverse engineer was a fun variation; I'd like to see games inspired by titles of non existent games, by quotations, by images; I'd like to see necromancic competitions to reanimate drafts long abandoned in the morgue files of the forge.                        </div>

                            I'm not sure where the actual hostility is coming from, here.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>As to Graham's suggestions, the only one that I don't care for is the .txt file - as someone who enjoys looking at serviceable fonts, I think it's a bit too draconian.<br/><br/>I do understand where he's coming from, however: I think that the only reason that I took any sort of place in Iron Chef was because my game was the most ... traditional ... in terms of subject matter of any that were submitted.  I'm not sure what this means, other than reflecting the idea that what people want from game contests and the extremes that folks are willing to go for a contest are two separate things.<br/><br/>That's not much of an explanation.                        </div>

                            Nice. What I'd like, I think, are new ideas about running competitions. Most competitions go: Get a challenge; Submit PDF within time limit; Score PDF in various categories; declare winner. It works, but there's got to be other ways to do it. <br/><br/>I like the various design-oriented ideas, above, and also the bullet list thing. And Mark V has given me a bizarre reverse engineering idea: "Write a review. NOT A GAME. At the end of the review period, the reviews will be randomly distributed to write games from."<br/><br/>I missed out:<br/><br/>13. Everyone must submit under a pseudonym (and use that pseudonym in the forums). Because the feedback you give to a stranger is <i>totally</i> different to the feedback you give to someone you know or whom you think is an experienced game designer.<br/><br/>What else?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            How about a contest when the judging isn't based on the game as written at all, but entirely on game play? So the game would get run for a group, and then the players and GM would get to review it!                        </div>

                            I like your ideas, Graham.  Of course, many of them could be boiled down to:<br/><br/>1.  Behave like Graham.<br/><br/>Because you embody most of the positive qualities you are looking for, in terms of feedback and support.  Everybody, go look at the GC 2006 threads and see what I mean.<br/><br/>The more intense the demands, obviously, the higher the failure rate, so emulating the Game Chef model stems in part from practical concerns.  That is a heavy commitment, but adding a playtest component or iterative judging would make it even more onerous.  I don't see any way around that, so perhaps a contest like the one you imagine would be for a select few.  Nothing wrong with that, really.  <br/><br/>I used a psuedonym in GC 2006 and was a little taken aback at the way I was treated, so I'm all for enforced anonymity.                        </div>

I like this idea - but there are two problems with it (1) how do you know if what you're hearing is the game, or the group; and (2) ye crikey, man - it's hard enough to get people to review their lot when it doesn't involve listening to (an hour) or hours of recordings?                        </div>

                            Graham asked privately about my GC 2006 experience, which may be relevant - as an anonymous n00b, I didn't feel like I got much feedback or criticism at all.  Graham and Eric Boyd were noteworthy exceptions.  Some of the feedback I got seemed harsh, and I got the feeling that if my peers had known it was a friend, they might have given my game a second look.  I might be reading a lot into it, but I remember thinking "Gosh, this is a little rough."  Of course my game was sort of broken as well...                        </div>

Gotta agree here. Much like complex game systems, my eyes glaze over when I see a long constitution of contest rules, especially when I see how much time and effort it would take to complete. I guess that's just me though, since the contests seem to be pretty popular with everyone else. :P                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>This stuff is not discussed and critiqued and challenged a tenth of enough.</blockquote>
I completely agree, layout and graphic design, etc, is not discussed and critiqued and so on often enough.  However, I feel it is <i>completely out of place</i> in most if not all game design contests, especially considering the significant percentage of us that need to hire out layout/design/art director people after completing our product, to turn it from 'awesome and playable game' (which is the more important factor) to 'awesome and playable and pretty game'.  <br/><br/>By judging based on "Beauty" or whatever, you are asking for a skill that only a small subset of game designers actually have, and a skill that is imho unnecessary during the <i>rule creation</i> portion of game development, which is what 99% of contests is about - coming up with fun things to play, not fun things to look at.                        </div>

                            I really support the idea of a contest for graphic designers and layout guys.  Maybe pick a deserving micropress project and give them all an identical text file, a few pieces of art, two weeks, and a can of Jolt.  Let them critique each other and then the project author picks the final winner.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd love to see what our graphic design community would do with Ganakagok.  It's got cards, diagrams, illustrations, and a very evocative theme.  That might be too ambitious, and Bill might not be interested, though.                        </div>

                            I think a challenge involving actual play would be teh awesome.<br/><br/>I'm going to throw a big picture thought into this mix - the whole "Game Design Challenge" thing is <i>very</i> new. It's fun and awesome, but like all things, new and interesting variations on the medium will be necessary for it to not become staid and boring (and useless) - especially given the amount of entrants into (f'rex) GC06 and Rev/Eng. I don't think having tightly focused design challenges that only get 6 or 7 entrants to be a bad thing, at all.<br/><br/>Which is to say, Graham, you should TOTALLY run a content with those rules. I dunno if I would participate, but I think it should happen.                        </div>

<p>Then, y'know, don't participate in that one, or read Bringhurst. It's not like there aren't enough contests to go around. I <em>never</em> do 24-hour ones and often skip GC and I still get a lot of participation in.</p>

                            I'm enjoying this. I like the joint txt/design thing that Timothy suggested. <br/><br/>Another thing I want is for the competition entries to be put on a Wiki. Then, instead of saying to the creator "This text is confusing" or "This needs an example", you edit the rules. (There should probably be a ban on changing the game mechanics: just editing the text to make the existing mechanics clearer).<br/><br/>Then the prize gets split between the creator and the people who edited / updated / clarified his rules.

                            Mea culpa on the Owlbear thing, Graham - it started as sort of a joke, but you goofs took it seriously.  Hence the troubling lack of rules.  If I offer another contest, ever, it'll be more carefully outlined.                        </div>

And maybe that's more backwards.  Honestly, I'd rather we were all pretty critical of all game submissions.  Even more critical of games by designers we halfway know, and more gentle with the ones we don't know.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I do like Graham's optician's judging concept: Game 1, or game 2?  Game 3 or game 4?<br/><br/>I'd like to see less subjective judgment called for.  For instance: what elements of this game do you think would work well in play?  What don't you think would work well?  What wasn't clear?  As opposed to: Do you think this game would play well?  (10 points)                        </div>

<p>I'd like to emphasize limits more. In the original Game Chef/Ronnies contests, the four-word restriction was good not only because it was a spur to creativity and a challenge for the designers, but because the judges and audience got to see how different people handled the same elements.</p>
<p>I liked the suggestion at the start of the Reverse Engineering Challenge that there should be three character sheets and everyone had to design a game for one of those sheets. The "write the game review first, then write a game for it" challenge would likewise work better if there were only three reviews to choose from (but the reviews would have to avoid discussing mechanics, except for a couple stat names.)</p>
<p>I think the playtesting requirements suggested in this thread aren't really workable, but what about: a small group does some freeform play, throwing in an occasional stat reference (but no mechanics,) transcribes a few relevant scenes of actual play, and then the designers have to design a traditional RPG around that actual play?</p>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I really support the idea of a contest for graphic designers and layout guys.  Maybe pick a deserving micropress project and give them all an identical text file, a few pieces of art, two weeks, and a can of Jolt.  Let them critique each other and then the project author picks the final winner.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd love to see what our graphic design community would do with Ganakagok.  It's got cards, diagrams, illustrations, and a very evocative theme.  That might be too ambitious, and Bill might not be interested, though.</blockquote>
No, no, I'd totally love for Ganakagok to be volunteered for this kind of project.  Jason, you haven't seen the Ganakagok Tarot that Dave Petroski created, but we played with them at Dexcon and they really add something to the game.  You'll see when you play in "The Messenger Feast" at Dreamation (where the Nitu will meet the Nikvingi, exiles from the rocky islands over the sea to the south).  But my point is that they brought home to me the power of good graphic design to bring a setting to life and to facilitate play.  And my design skills are rudimentary at best.<br/><br/>I also think that judging by comparative ranking is in general a good idea, since that avoids the "intercoder reliability" problem of multiple judges applying criteria differently; look at the wildly varying scores some of the Rev/Eng games received.  Different judges' rankings can be tabulated to show a clear winner if one exists, and tie-breaking systems can be specified in advance to avoid argument or controversy.  But every entry would have to get compared to every other entry in some fashion for this to work.  This might require all judges to read every game and rank-order them.  Some other system would then be required to generate more detailed feedback (every judge critique his top two or three choices, or every judge is randomly assigned some number of entries to write reviews on).                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham Walmsley</cite>And Mark V has given me a bizarre reverse engineering idea: "Write a review. NOT A GAME. At the end of the review period, the reviews will be randomly distributed to write games from."</blockquote>
If I had had the time to do it right, my original plan for Rev/Eng was to write Dangerous Ideas, then write a review of it, and then submit the review instead of the game.  The trick would have been to get all the relevant rules incorporated into the review in a natural way but from which you could still extract (and play) the game itself.  Ran out of time in the end, though.<br/><br/>From experiences with contests in <a href="http://ifcomp.org/" rel="nofollow">other contexts</a>, one way to handle the anonymity issue is simply to have a process by which authors can submit entries anonymously (or with a pseudonym) if they want to.  Then after the contest is over, the author may reveal themselves if they want.<br/><br/>I do like the idea of 'team' contests, where one person comes up with the rules and another person does the layout or what have you.  (And another the setting?  And another the character sheet?)  I could envision both a contest where everyone entered separately and then were randomly assigned to groups (sort of like Rev/Eng) or a contest where you gathered a team together first and then submitted it.<br/><br/>The other thing I've learned from IF contests is that there is no end of debate about how best to run a contest.  Fortunately for you all, it looks like this discussion is happily focused on how best to run a new contest, not how to change the old ones.                        </div>

Both ideas have a lot of merit.<br/><br/>On the train home tonight, I started to think about a Christmas competition, with a seasonal theme. I'm starting to really like the idea.
