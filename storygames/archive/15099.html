Share your cyberpunk visions and favorite future-tech discoveries and ideas. What does future-noir Los Angeles look like? What technology predictions are really exciting? Which bits from that (maybe terrible) movie did you like best? Throw out your favorite Gibson-isms, he won't mind!<br/><br/>In the future, LA is still crawling with cars, but most of them are controlled remotely by the the massive traffic management system. Relax and enjoy the ride, with no danger of accident or traffic jams. Of course, every vehicle is tracked and monitored, and moves at an approved pace, so if you have to get somewhere discreetly or quickly, you'd best be ready to drive on the sketchy sub-roads, or hack the traffic control program in your car and get ready to start a helluva chase.<br/><br/>In the future, the Interface will be available even to the implant-free. Forget specs, why not have <a href="http://www.elementalled.com/leducation/blog/innovative-technology/led-lights-make-augmented-vision-a-reality/" rel="nofollow">augmented vision through LED contact lenses</a>? <br/><br/>In the future, users will be able to slot software upgrades into all their stuff, including their brain. Need your cyberlegs to be faster? Override the factory settings by slotting in this side-loading upgrade. What's that, you need to learn Kung Fu? We've got you covered.<br/><br/>What else? Feel free to write it up as Technoir gear (with tags) if you like.<br/><br/> I'd be especially interested in seeing ideas for virtual Objects that represent action in the Interface, to balance out all of the physical Objects. I can see someone buying special security intrusion kits (Tags: <em>linked, semi-autonomous, forceful, illegal</em> Upgrades: <em>fast, experimental, subtle, adaptive</em>) or maybe personal agents to manage tasks, such as false-identity management (Tags: <em>linked, semi-autonomous, wary, Illegal</em> Upgrades: <em>resourceful, encrypted</em>).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343420/#Comment_343420" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-20T16:09:53+00:00" title="September 20, 2011  4:09PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve, have you watched Wild Palms?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343429/#Comment_343429" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-20T18:09:15+00:00" title="September 20, 2011  6:09PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I kinda did already, with my Kilimanjaro Ring City transmission. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343437/#Comment_343437" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-20T20:30:29+00:00" title="September 20, 2011  8:30PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2011 8:30PM by Steve_Segedy.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan H.</cite>Steve, have you watched Wild Palms?</blockquote>\nI've never seen it, and if I've heard of it I never knew it was even remotely sci-fi.
