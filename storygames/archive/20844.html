I plan on using a oracle/oculus/story engine to fuel me for thirty days in my impromptu 30 day dungeon. <br/>\tInspired by the mesmerizing engine, Oculus, I plan on writing a first person account of a man that walks into a Tardis-like dodecahedron (d12) that is filled with the brim with random bit of oracle junk, from tarot cards to fortune cookies filled with singular words, to vines holding trinkets at random. <br/>\tThe Oracle Room, I call it, and I am thinking of how to turn O.R.A.C.L.E. into an acronym, takes the chooser to places which are connected to that random object or word. Perhaps the operator picks \u2018Fetid Vines\u2019 and he views in the room\u2019s portal a person moving through a dungeon of fetid vines. The person in the viewer is a familiar as the game \u2018Oculus\u2019 implies. <br/>\tTaking a job from a newspaper he is locked in the d12 for thirty days and he must chronicle the things he sees via his \u2018familiar\u2019<br/>\tHaving no experience or skill at dice probabilities, this is more a concept than a game, wish I could turn it into a game system that turns a person\u2019s reality into an oracle. <br/>\tSuggestions welcome!                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457616/#Comment_457616" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-28T18:30:29+00:00" title="October 28, 2016  6:30PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is interesting.

Right now it is in the chaos stage but I know from order there is chaos. I also thought of using a d6 to create some sort of magnification factor. 1 being micro (perhaps the inner thoughts of the familiar or person in the Oracular and 6 being macro (you see events on a city level. <br/><br/>I get my inspiration from <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0ByVeZxlFO74FWTZTQkJrUUNtZW8/edit?hl=en-GB&amp;forcehl=1" rel="nofollow">Oculus and got permission by the author to expand it</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457655/#Comment_457655" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-29T23:49:48+00:00" title="October 29, 2016 11:49PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A "magnification factor" is interesting.<br/><br/>The idea of a writer using a set of game rules is pretty fascinating, because a lot of the assumptions of roleplaying games can be thrown upside-down even when the mechanics are relatively "traditional".<br/><br/>As a simple example, a writer has no interest in competing with themselves, so it's very functional to tell them to "assign whatever score is appropriate" in situations where, in a "normal" RPG, that would very unhelpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457666/#Comment_457666" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-30T01:46:24+00:00" title="October 30, 2016  1:46AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2016 1:49AM by Kenny_J.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is also different in the sense that you would want to the rules to get out of the way of a fun story game, but for writing its really using a set of rules (or parameters) to challenge one's writing. To get in the way and make the writer incorporate or circumvent. Honestly on a broader level its no different than constraining your writing to a certain genre or type of literature, or following the hero's journey or something. Its just about meaningful constraint.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valdus" title="Valdus"><img alt="Valdus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/383/nKKAUZ7UNWKGK.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valdus">Valdus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457686/#Comment_457686" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-30T18:06:04+00:00" title="October 30, 2016  6:06PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2016 6:06PM by Valdus.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            THE LATEST NOTES ON A SYSTEM<br/><br/>Inspired by Oculus, I imagine a construct of the imagination. A system of controlled or directed writing where the creative process is fictionalized. <br/><br/>The \u2018player\u2019 builds a table of twelve things either spontaneously before a session or throughout the day. Twelve symbols, words or images that should prove to inspire within the \u2018chamber\u2019. <br/><br/>I imagine a chamber which is filled with an impossible number of objects, the player picks one of these objects, symbols, words as an analogy of picking from an array of random engines or oracles. Then the chamber, the imagination, is activated and see where the symbol takes the player, write until the vision is occluded. <br/><br/>There is also the technique of making a twelve slot table of symbols, words or images and consulted with a d12. Any number of tables can be generated. Rolls of a 1 or a 12 are of significance. On a 1 a d6 is consulted with the following results <br/><br/>1- Connection broken return to the Oracle chamber <br/>2- The vision is restricted to a micro view (an object, or thought is focused)<br/>3- A host in the realm is revealed or focused. <br/>4- pending<br/>5- pending<br/>6- The vision is expanded to a macro view  (a city, a nation, a continent or a god is focused. <br/><br/>On a roll of a 12, a link to a host is formed, a focus on an individual which escorts the Oracular operator through the world. <br/><br/>In essence it is a version of Oculus which rejects a table of 20-40 standard words for a table of infinite possibilities which the player creates or chooses on the fly. Further the creation or focus on a familiar is but a possibility, and not the standard. <br/><br/>I did away with anything that might run the risk of getting in the way of the writing. I wanted a light-hearted mechanic, something that I can choose or not, what was important was the focus on the writing. <br/><br/>Combat resolution has not been addressed. But I wonder if it can be resolved with the table of 12 in the system.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
