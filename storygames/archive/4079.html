I call attention to Game Chef.<br/><br/>I'm also betting (with a much better sense of being correct) that there are those who would design if they had the free energy, time, or simply lack a design process that produces who would be willing to work with someone else that could fill in those gaps.<br/><br/>So, this discussion is for those who have Little Ideas that they want to see developed OR want to help someone develop their idea. Negotiations are up to the people involved, but I'd suggest, at minimum, a shared ownership of the work involved if nothing else. Probably after the first post where a would-be designer and a commissioned designer have agreed to discuss working together, talk should leave the forum (or move to whispers, if nothing else).<br/><br/>So, post your Little Ideas/Desire to be Commissioned!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jimmiebjr" title="jimmiebjr"><img alt="jimmiebjr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jimmiebjr">jimmiebjr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93006/#Comment_93006" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T14:33:54+00:00" title="September  4, 2007  2:33PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I have one of those Little Ideas and not a ton of time to really develop it. Here's the basic pitch (and I warn that there is some fleshing out that needs done).<br/><br/>Imagine if the Battle of Thermopylae was a cyclical event. That battle was just one of a series of Great Battles fought between groups of competing gods. On one side, the gods are numerous but relatively weak. On the other, the gods are fewer, but have greater power. The Numerous Gods seek to rule, directly and malevolently. They, as they are able, imbue those whom they can sway, with a portion of their power. They tend to work quietly, so as not to gain the attention of the Few Gods. Thus far, they have not been subtle enough as each time their attempts to rule have been detected by the Few. The Few finds a number of like-minded and imbues them with a portion of their power. When those who can be imbued have been, the Numerous send them to conquer and enslave. When that happens, the Few muster their own Imbued to meet them. What happens next has been called Thermopylae, Roark's Drift, Chosin Reservoir in the past. Often, these battles have no name and are fought in the streets of cities like Tombstone, Leningrad, Pristina, and Mogadishu. Thus far, the Few have prevailed but they may not always do so.<br/><br/>Flavor Text: It's not a glamorous life delivering pizzas but it pays the bills and it gets you on the road, out of the smothering confines of the office. You know your city well enough but lately even the city has seemed close and stuffy. And you seem drawn west. To where, you have no idea. For what reason, you couldn't begin to say. But you've been having dreams where you are known as The Gatherer and the first person you are to Gather has no more an idea why as you do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Consonant%20Dude" title="Consonant Dude"><img alt="Consonant Dude" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/6858/fhjfhffblack2iv7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Consonant%20Dude">Consonant Dude</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94100/#Comment_94100" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T19:36:22+00:00" title="September  8, 2007  7:36PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I apologise if this isn't flashy but mine is fairly simple: I'm not really satisfied with any Cyberpunk game. I don't really need a rich CP setting. I'd just like to see a fairly light-to-medium cyberpunk RPG. Something evocative, colorful and flexible enough to cover most of the possibilities the genre offer.  <br/><br/>If someone was to conceive an inspiring cyberpunk engine that isn't drowning in needless details, ungodly handling time or too focused, I'd be ecstatic!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
