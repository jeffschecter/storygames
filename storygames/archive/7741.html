Read these rules for all to hear, before starting the poem.<br/><br/>The players are friends going on a wilderness trek togehter, staying the nights at open cabins.<br/><br/>Use your own names, but let all other facts and relations in the poem be fiction. Keep that in mind and play for fun.<br/><br/><b>START</b><br/>Sit down in a circle. Take of shoes and stockings, and place them in front of you, for all to see, in the center of the circle. It is important that all players have naked feet in this game. I know it may make you nervous, but you have to dare it. Please!<br/><br/>Choose a timekeeper. He/she note the time. The poem is to last for 15 minutes. <br/><br/><b>THE SONG</b><br/>Find a song all of you know, and sing the first verse of it. This is your "wilderness-song". You will end all scenes in the poem by singing this around the fire of a cabin. Each time you sing this song the day ends (and a night goes by before the next scene).<br/><br/><b>THE SCENES</b><br/>Each scene in the poem symbolizes one day on your trek in the woods and/or mountains. You play as many scenes as time allows. All scenes will consist of two major elements: nature and footwear. You start the scene with a dialogue on nature, then it shifts into a dialogue on footwear, and it ends by all of you singing the wilderness-song. Anyone may initiate the shifts of the scene, and all must adhere to the shifts.<br/><br/><b><i>- Nature: </i></b>all comments on the scenery should be positive, describing how you experience the landscape and/or the weather, letting the other characters know in which way you enjoy it. Follow up on comments: if one player say it rains, then you may comment on how the rain washes you face, or how droplets drop from the branches. Be positive! Communicate enjoyment! <br/><br/><b><i>- Footwear: </i></b>all comments on shoes/socks should reveal some truth about your relationship to the man/woman whose footwear you comment on. These relationships may be troublesome or positive, or both, and you may initiate romance. Your relationships may change and develop during this part of the dialogue, but remember to keep all comments related to footwear in some way.<br/><br/><b>THE FINAL</b><br/>When the timekeeper announces that it is time to end the game, you will play the final. Start with the timekeeper, and go clockwise around the circle. One by one you will stretch out and take hold of two feet, and make an announcement. Each player will do this in turn. When it is your turn, you may do the friendship or the romantic final.<br/><br/><i><b>- Friendship:</b></i> grab one foot each of two players, and tell them how your friendship with them deepens due to this wilderness trek. Look them in the eyes, smiling, while doing this. Let go of the feet to end your announcement.<br/><br/><i><b>- Romantic:</b></i> grab both feet of one player, and tell him/her that the two of you become lovers/sweethearts/spouses after the trek. Look the player in the eyes, smiling, when doing this. Let go of the feet to end your announcement.<br/><br/>When all have had their final, you sing the wilderness-song, and the poem ends. Give some hugs and thanks, and go wash your hands.<br/><br/><i>Have a nice trek!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_171826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171826/#Comment_171826" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-28T23:42:37+00:00" title="September 28, 2008 11:42PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Martin Bull Gudmundsen wrote this on the game:</b><br/><br/>I am Norwegian, and I have played this game. (I am also a fan and friend of the creator. And I am new here. Hi.)<br/><br/>I was quite scared at first, because I\u2019m not really that comfortable with acts of intimacy. Now, touching someone\u2019s feet is one thing. Saying I care about them, and even worse, the reasons why, that\u2019s the big challenge. I suspect the game was written for people like me.<br/><br/>I eased into it, though, or was helped. At first I kept silent, then someone made a comment about my role\u2019s unmatched socks, and I reacted aggressively: \u201cWell, I couldn\u2019t care less about matching my socks,\u201d to which he replied, \u201cwell, that\u2019s how you can get women.\u201d Later on, I described how that person\u2019s role took great care in how his shoes appeared, asking sarcastically if he got any more women than me. But then, another player, herself a woman, declared that she found unmatched socks to be kind of charming, and things turned around. My role was more comfortable with the group, had some nice conversations with the matching socks-guy, and at one point, I even asked someone to borrow some shoe polish. At the time of foot-grabbing, I told him that \u201ceven though our ways are almost diametrically opposed, I feel that we now understand each other better,\u201d to which he agreed.<br/><br/>Now, as I said, I suspect the game was written for people like me. The interactions I made in role matched my real life way of interacting quite well. I feel like an outsider, mostly noticed by how I don\u2019t match the world (although I do try to match up my socks); I may be overly aggressive when this is made salient; I soften up when I get some kind of approval. The effect from playing the game was mostly on my consciousness. Although I knew these things about me already, my mental model about my social self was further sharpened by this symbolic exercise. However, emotionally and behaviourally, I think I\u2019m still much the same. It was not a life-changing experience, not even in a small way. (I don\u2019t know whether it was designed to be; if Tomas says that it was, I could try to come up with some analyses of why it didn\u2019t work that way for me.)<br/><br/>I told Tomas beforehand that I wasn\u2019t sure whether the weirdness of the game would help or hinder its goals. I still am not; or, I would say, it depends on the player. The workings of the game are beautiful. It takes some highly abstract activities, makes you imagine some very concrete ones, and then makes them symbols of some deeply important personal issues.<br/><br/>When you accept its premise, each in-game act you make contains several layers of meaning (I count three or four[1]), merged perfectly onto one another. It provides a rather safe context in which to explore some pretty scary stuff. Accepting the premise of the game, however, does not come automatically. Even though we were Norwegian, I think we had some difficulties with that. This may have been one of the reasons why I didn\u2019t get all that emotionally involved. (Another reason, of course, would be those intimacy issues.)<br/><br/>The game would profit from some kind of device that made more people accept it. More of a push to suspend their disbeliefs. (As it is, the disbelief its weirdness creates is an important part of how it works, but that\u2019s the nice thing about suspension of disbelief: You don\u2019t really begin to believe, you\u2019re just more willing to go along with it.) Some people would think that this doesn\u2019t reach them as RPG players; they would need to be showed either that it does, or that it doesn\u2019t need to for them to enjoy it. Some other people would think that it\u2019s too weird; the game would have to make them trust that it\u2019s meaningful all the same. And some would think, like me, that this is too scary; some kind of safety net might have been helpful. (I wouldn\u2019t have played this at all if Tomas hadn\u2019t made me sit down with those other people before revealing which game we were supposed to play; even then, I came very close to backing out.)<br/><br/>To summarize: One foot in the wild is an interesting game, with even more interesting intentions behind it, but it may as yet be too raw to achieve its full potential. It\u2019s really less scary and more fun once you get into it, but this should be demonstrated in the game\u2019s text, not just by assurances from the creator. The idea behind it, using weird but highly symbolic acts to probe into risky, personal stuff in this way, is great, and should be explored further, in this game as well as others.<br/><br/><br/><i>1) If anybody\u2019s interested: I see that each action of the game of the game has meaning as<br/>- A game activity in itself<br/>- A pointer away from the awkward circle, and towards the imagined surroundings, feet and shoes being of course important elements of a hiking trip\u2026<br/>- \u2026 which creates an emotionally safe context (hiking trips being related to calm and thoughtfulness), allowing:<br/>- a stylized form of social interactions, where the degree of abstraction helps rise consciousness about the real-life counterparts of those activities.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
