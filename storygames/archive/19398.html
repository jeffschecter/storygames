I know there are initial scenes, climatic scenes, and final scenes but those are only done once in a given story / adventure. The others below may be done multiple times. I also made a rule that two of the same type of scene should not be next to each other (that means I will not have a dramatic scene right after having played out a dramatic scene for example.) What I have so far is below. <br/><br/><b>Investigation Scene</b> = Characters looking around an area or gathering clues and information.<br/><b>Dramatic Scene</b> = The most common scene. Characters interaction, dialogue, and emotional conflict. Characters coming head-to-head. Put something at stake.<br/><b>Recognition Scene</b> =  The character finds out something important.<br/><b>Action Scene</b> = All about action, reaction, and physical movement. It can be combat (harm, delay, or put an end to something), escape (trying to get away, avoid, or hide), or pursuit (follow, capture, or secure something).<br/><b>Unexpected Visitor</b> - Someone unexpected shows up. Problems arise.<br/><b>Meanwhile / Revelation Scene</b> = We, the players, find out something important that the characters probably may not know about. A remote location and does not involve the characters being present. This should be immediately randomized as a twist and kept quite short.<br/><b>Flashback Scene</b> = This should focus on the following: action, information, and character interaction. The information contained in the flashback must have some bearing on the main story. Use when the past directly affects the main story. Use flashbacks to deepen the understanding of a character.<br/><br/>Questions:<br/>1 - Should any of the above scene types be explained different? Do you have suggestions if so?<br/>2 - Do you know of a scene type that I did not mention that would be good for an RPG?<br/>3 - Any suggestions or thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431861/#Comment_431861" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-29T21:05:23+00:00" title="April 29, 2014  9:05PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2014 9:07PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What is this for?<br/><br/>The first thing that comes to mind is that these "types" seem like they come from different... families.<br/><br/>For example, Investigation Scene and Dramatic Scene tell us about the nature of the action within the scene. However, Dramatic Scenes are a very basic staple of (almost) any type of fiction. Whereas Investigation Scenes seem to me to be somewhat more genre-specific. (Or at least shouldn't appear as often in, say, a comedy sitcom, as they would in a detective novel.)<br/><br/>In contrast, Flashback Scene and Meanwhile Scene seem to be types of scene frames: "Now, we're watching a flashback." It doesn't tell us anything about the <i>content</i> of the scene itself: presumably a Flashback scene could have Dramatic, Investigation, or Action (etc.) content, no?<br/><br/>I'd say there's a big difference between the frame of the scene (how the scene opens), its main "meat" (the content), and its ending/transition. For example, I can envision a scene opening as a Flashback, including Investigation for most of its duration, and ending with an Unexpected Visitor (or some Action - "And then a shot rang out and Simon dropped to the floor, lifeless. Everyone scrambled for cover!").<br/><br/>I don't if that's helpful, but it's my first reaction to this! It's definitely a good start, and a thought-provoking list.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431869/#Comment_431869" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-30T00:04:42+00:00" title="April 30, 2014 12:04AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you looked at how Mythic GM Emulator does it?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doc%20Halloween" title="Doc Halloween"><img alt="Doc Halloween" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j28/DocHalloween/32x32_tiny_logo.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doc%20Halloween">Doc Halloween</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431875/#Comment_431875" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-30T04:33:37+00:00" title="April 30, 2014  4:33AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is for my solo rpg game sessions.

Maybe there's something here you can use. There's a school of thought that in concise, tight fiction a scene must Focus on either (or both):<br/>Drama: which progresses Character.<br/>Conflict: which progresses Plot.<br/><br/>Anything else hits the cutting room floor. (Conan punches a camel because he's a Barbarian hopped-up on black lotus; not because the camel presented a threat).<br/><br/>  Each scene has at least one important Element (an essential person, place, object or event/relationship). Think Chekhov's Gun. It must be there for a reason. But why? That is the Reveal. <br/><br/>  In this sense, every scene is an investigation scene. We (the audience) must learn something new about an Element or be introduced to a new Element. This Reveal happens through Drama or Conflict.<br/><br/>  A Scene is framed in time (Now or Then) and place (Here or There) in relation to the main character. Here/There can also be thought of as being immediately connected to the main character, as in Me/Mine or to someone else as in Them/Theirs. So:<br/><br/>Scene Type --------------Time--------- Placement<br/><b><br/>Flashback/Memory</b>...........Then..................Here (directly connected to Me/Mine)<br/><br/><b>Exposition/Narration</b>........Then...............There (Them/Theirs;others)<br/><br/><b>Current</b>.................................Now...............  Here<br/><br/><b>Meanwhile</b>............................Now............... There<br/><br/>and also <b>Fore-Shadow</b>.........Later................Any<br/><br/>Thus a Scene takes place in a Time (Now/Then) and a Place (Here/There), has at least one important Element (a person, place, object or event/relationship) Revealed or about which new info is Revealed through either Conflict or Drama.<br/><br/>Examples:<br/><b>Flashback</b>: growing up (Then) with my happy, care-free sister (Here or Me/Mine) who is introduced to <br/>drugs by a small-time hood (Element). Do we Focus on Drama or Conflict? I'd choose Drama to set up <br/>the next scene.<br/><br/><b>Meanwhile</b>: across town (There), my sister - a moll (Element) to the mob boss (Element and reinforces <br/>Them/Theirs) - is trying to escape (Now). Conflict, I would think. Note that even though she is <br/>still my sister, in this scene she is an Element of Them/Theirs; I am not directly connected or <br/>involved in the scene. Does she get away? Is she killed in the attempt? <br/><br/>  From this, one could develop random tables and flow charts to combine and direct the various parts, drive the plot towards a climax, or fail forward to another scene (Character development can be negative as well as positive) or introduce unexpected Elements. Fiasco meets AD&amp;D(1st ed). Advanced Fiascos and Fictions! <br/><br/>  Hmm - I think I just did a bad, bad thing...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431904/#Comment_431904" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-30T17:06:52+00:00" title="April 30, 2014  5:06PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            TVTropes.com is probably a good resource for this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431905/#Comment_431905" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-30T17:47:45+00:00" title="April 30, 2014  5:47PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2014 5:49PM by Dreamer.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think maybe romantic scenes  may be an option.

And often times, a scene may be a combination of two or more scene types.'<br/><br/>Maybe one rolls 2 or 3 times on the table to set the scene?<br/><br/>I'm also thinking that scene framing should be partly determined by the player in the frame of the PC. So, maybe you first chooses a scene type based on what you want your PC's intent is, followed by a roll or two representing that which is not controlled by you.<br/><br/>So for example, you choose to investigate as your next action, so you know it will be an investigation scene. Then you roll, and you get Action. So, you decide it means that you set out to investigate, but maybe encountered some opposition trying to protect their secret.<br/><br/>I'm not sure, though, if that starts to creep into storyboarding the scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431941/#Comment_431941" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-01T12:51:27+00:00" title="May  1, 2014 12:51PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>So for example, you choose to investigate as your next action, so you know it will be an investigation scene.

For example, roll a six-sided die every few beats in the action: on a roll of 6, the scene type becomes a different (randomly selected) type.<br/><br/>So you would have many scenes play out as expected (the Investigation scene remains an Investigation scene), but some transform at some point, sometimes early in the scene, sometimes late. (The Romance scene becomes a Revelation scene! "Oh, Hank! I'm pregnant with your evil twin's child!")<br/><br/>You could also have it linked to whatever other mechanics you use. If you roll 2d6 for conflict resolution, on a roll of doubles the scene type changes.

I see these as asides that develop a character or relationship between two characters, but they are not necessarily dramatic, or having things at stake. TV series have lots of these little scenes and moments between characters that do nothing for the overall plot of the episode, but do much for the fleshing out of the characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432107/#Comment_432107" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-05T04:29:05+00:00" title="May  5, 2014  4:29AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">@MartinEden</a>: I like using "refresh scenes", too.
