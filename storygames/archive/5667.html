It's high-crunch and detail, classic task-resolution, kinda brutally realistic, yet still streamlined in parts. It's neat. It's one of those cases where it's important to *not* use all your optional combat rules, but I do like it.<br/><br/>Since then, I've been a much different gamer: usually playing small press fare with lighter systems, more story-driving rules, much more improvisation (less planning), and more ad hoc games. I think I'd like to give CORPS another spin some time. So: for this system (or a similar system that you love), what kind of stories/situations do you think would work best?<br/><br/>One idea I had: a gritty modern espionage game in the style of "the Sandbaggers". You're given a situation on the ground, you can cope with it as best as you can, with no promises regarding plot, success, or the survival of your character beyond a single arc. This would fit in with allowing action and "fights" to happen, but not too many. (Both because it doesn't fit the setting, and because it might take longer systemwise.) Of course, I'd need to pregen some proto-characters before hand and/or figure out how to improvise new NPCs faster.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126742/#Comment_126742" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-15T05:00:34+00:00" title="February 15, 2008  5:00AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know, that sort of thing seems all about the fights.

Maybe that's good for you and your group, maybe that just gets in the way of actually playing, and maybe a player spends too much on Electronics and not enough on the Awareness/Perception skill...   <br/><br/>You may want to consider pre-gen-ing PCs, with X points/skills left open for customization.<br/><br/>The other benefit to that, is that if PCs get slaughtered early in, you can simply give them another pre-gen to customize and insert a new agent, or different team, quickly and without much fuss.<br/><br/>If you want to maximize the gun fetish of the game, I recommend also snagging 3G3- More Guns Guns Guns, which lists a ridiculous amount of real world firearms and the stats for CORPS (and many other 80's rpgs).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126838/#Comment_126838" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-15T10:49:37+00:00" title="February 15, 2008 10:49AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had 3G3; gave it to another gamer who, honestly, loved it much more.

What I like about Porter's design library is that as each of his games gets published you can see that he's taken what he's learned from previous designs and specifically tried to file off sharp corners or fill in a bit of mechanical business that the previous game did not do so well. If I were going to run any kind of 'high-realism' type of game, then I'd be sorely tempted to use <i>EABA</i> or <i>Corps</i> (most likely the former, because I appreciate the smoothed off corners between the two 8)).<br/><br/>I also wish more had taken a look at Greg's <i>Epiphany</i>; I'm not fond of the magic system in it, but it is clever, and I quite like the system it has for describing characters and managing interaction and resolution.
