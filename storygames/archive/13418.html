It's a new character option, to be made available alongside the Knights Stellar.<br/><br/><a href="http://yearoflivingfree.info/local--files/polaris/Cult-of-the-Sun-POLARIS.pdf" rel="nofollow">Download it here (PDF, 150kB, direct link).</a><br/><br/>I'd be interested in your feedback, not only on the aspects themselves but also on the concept. Does placing another organisation alongside the Knights Stellar defeat the point of Polaris? Does the game benefit from being very tightly focused on the Knights and only the Knights? Would I need to replace Zeal and Weariness with something else for these new Monks?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302475/#Comment_302475" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-28T04:45:17+00:00" title="November 28, 2010  4:45AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could see using something like this, although it'd need a bit more bolstering in the mythological department to carry a gravity equivalent of the knights with their doom-filled fate and tangled relationship with the queen, king, Solaris knight, etc.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I like having a choice of character class for chargen purposes, as it would rather strongly focus a player's attention on this particular matter; he would no longer be thinking of who his character is, but only whether he should be this class or that. With just one class of characters the class fades into the background and emphasizes the personal differences between the characters, while a Sun-monk would first and foremost be a Sun-monk.<br/><br/>I know that this wouldn't work for most, but I could see using a few special character classes with a randomized class selection of some sort: roll a '1' and your character is a Sun-monk instead of a star-knight, something like that. I'd perhaps like it even more if this procedure was followed at the end of character creation instead of the more obvious beginning: first choose what your character is about, then find out what sort of background organization he hails from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308805/#Comment_308805" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-19T16:40:43+00:00" title="January 19, 2011  4:40PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry to perform necromancy, but I could see Sun-monks being a completely rad Order for the Mistaken to control. Higher-order demons, basically. Maybe disciples of the Solaris Knight or something. I'm definitely going to work in a Sun-monk character next time I play Polaris!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
