I have a few more to gather before I'm done with my current "to buy" list, so I was curious what the community here believed to be RPGs one must absolutely have so that I would have something to buy next.<br/><br/>I also figure making such a list would be great for newcomers to our subsection of the hobby.<br/><br/>I'll edit the first post as the list grows<br/><br/>Let's format the list as such :<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Name of the game</b></span><br/><br/><b>What it's about:<br/>Why it's essential:<br/>Where to find it:</b><br/><br/>I'll give the first one and wait for some community input.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Apocalypse World</b></span><br/><br/><b>What it's about:</b> Fifty or so years ago, the world ended. Apocalypse World is a Post-Apocalyptic RPG. The characters are made through Playbooks, unique character sheets, different for each post-apocalyptic fiction archetypes.  The players, along with the Master of Ceremonies, create a twisted, dead world to create stories in.<br/><br/><b>Why it's essential:</b> It's essential to any Story Gamer's library for 2 reasons. First of all, the system is beautifully simple and elegant. Whenever a PC's action triggers a move, that character's player rolls 2d6, added to one of 5 stats numbered from -2 to +3. If the result is over 10, the action succeeds beautifully. If the result is in between 7 and 9, the action succeeds, but there are complications. And on 6 or less, the Master of Ceremonies gets to go crazy and make is own move. The second reason is the simplicity of hosting it. It's a game that plays beautifully with little more than 15 minutes of preparation before every session passed the first (the first session requires no other preparation than showing up with the playbooks printed).<br/><br/><b>Where to find it:</b> <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/" rel="nofollow">http://apocalypse-world.com/</a><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Burning Wheel</b></span><br/><br/><b>What it's about:</b> Having high fantasy adventures. The implied setting seems very much influenced by Lord of the Rings. The players are people, important or otherwise, in a fantasy world, fighting for what they believe in.<br/><br/><b>Why it's essential:</b> Because it's sneaky. It's deep and complicated, and will please the biggest system geeks of all of us. It's a great introduction to story games for long time DnD players, given the setting and the depths of the system. The rules are also extremely modular, making it easy for the GM to decide how complicated he or she wants his or her game to be. Plus, Burning Wheel Gold is a gorgeous book.<br/><br/><b>Where to find it:</b> <a href="http://burningwheel.org/" rel="nofollow">http://burningwheel.org/</a><br/><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Dread</b></span><br/><br/><b>What it's about:</b>  Dread is, to put it simply, the greatest horror game ever made. In Dread, the players are doomed individuals in an horror-movie scenario, from old school slasher to japanese ghost story.<br/><br/><b>Why it's essential:</b> The game is powered by Jenga. Whenever the players try something that may fail, they have to make a pull. Refusal to make the pull means failure. Successfully pulling a block means success. If the tower falls, your character dies horribly. The mechanic is brilliant because of how it seamlessly builds tension in the real world, mirroring the stress the characters are feeling. Terror is a hard feeling to generate at the table, and stress of losing your character from a bad pull is the next best thing<br/><br/><b>Where to find it:</b> <a href="http://www.tiltingatwindmills.net/buystuff.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tiltingatwindmills.net/buystuff.html</a><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Fiasco</b></span><br/><br/><b>What it's about:</b>  Fiasco is the big one. If there was one emissary-game of the story game world, it's this guy. Fiasco is a GMless game where every player plays a broken individual in the midst of a pregnant situation that can and will go bad. People will likely die. It'll be glorious. The game seeks to emulate movies such as Snatch or The Big Lebowski. <br/><br/><b>Why it's essential:</b><br/><br/><b>Where to find it:</b> <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/store/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/store/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396569/#Comment_396569" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T08:59:30+00:00" title="November  6, 2012  8:59AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Alex, it seems you want <a href="http://story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=Story_Games_by_Title" rel="nofollow">something like this</a>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Trepanier" title="Alex_Trepanier"><img alt="Alex_Trepanier" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Trepanier">Alex_Trepanier</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396571/#Comment_396571" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T09:16:40+00:00" title="November  6, 2012  9:16AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not looking for a master list as much as I'm looking for suggestions on what to buy next.

The rules also determine how this control changes during the game from scene to scene and even within scenes.  Play passes from player to player as each takes control of the action and drives the story forward.  This is much less chaotic than it might sound as the rules provide a framework to ensure that everything remains orderly (more or less; sometimes chaos is a good thing) and that play proceeds towards creating a story.<br/><br/>For that is what Universalis is all about, real time, on-the-spot creation of a story."*<br/><br/>I feel that it is important because it is the only truly universal game system for tabletop play that I've ever seen. It is almost a "meta-RPG" in that you could use its techniques to build Guimmicks that then would be "baked" into an alternate product that more like a normal RPG.<br/><br/><sub>* <a href="http://ramshead.indie-rpgs.com/WhatIsUniversalis.html" rel="nofollow">from Ramshead Publishing</a></sub> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Trepanier" title="Alex_Trepanier"><img alt="Alex_Trepanier" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Trepanier">Alex_Trepanier</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396592/#Comment_396592" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T10:22:31+00:00" title="November  6, 2012 10:22AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2012 10:25AM by Alex_Trepanier.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a> : I had never heard of this game but it seems really interesting.

There are a number of spin-offs and variants like "The Puddle" and "Snowball" that are interesting too. Ron Edwards wrote an excellent essay about it called "Understanding The Pool".<br/><br/>* "Happy Birthday Robot" and "Do: Pilgrims Of The Flying Temple" by Daniel Solis \u2014 One can debate to what extent these are RPGs, but as engines for creative storytelling they're interesting. They're also great for introducing kids to story games.<br/><br/>I'll be interested to read the entry[ies] about "Burning Wheel", as I don't consider it a Story Game, more of a traditional crunchy RPG with some story-encouraging mechanisms (like the detailed chargen and the Belief system), but I'm willing to be convinced <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396626/#Comment_396626" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T15:15:02+00:00" title="November  6, 2012  3:15PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2012 4:35PM by Tristan.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Microscope</b></span><br/><br/><b>What it's about:</b> A fractal game about colaboratively creating all flavors of Histories in a non-linear way.

Also because yes, it is "Histories", and that is not a typo.<br/><br/><b>Where to find it:</b> <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lamemage.com/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396631/#Comment_396631" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T16:31:24+00:00" title="November  6, 2012  4:31PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Primetime Adventures should probably be on this list, as well.

I want to do this four nights a week!" to "I would rather never play another roleplaying, board, or story game again than have to speak to some of these people," and it started bleeding over into other areas of my life.<br/><br/>And one of the things I've realized is that a player's approach to Fiasco and Apocalypse World (and to a lesser extent Burning Wheel) determine which direction he or she will push my reaction.  <br/><br/>Satisfying Fiasco games have players who are reasonably comfortable with subjectivity and with flawed characters, and who know when to take the spotlight, when to be supporting cast, and when to be audience.  A really satisfying game often has at least one player who delights in watching his character come to a terrible end, which is part of the tension between the player succeeding at creating a meaty narrative versus the character failing at his or her goals.  <br/><br/>Satisfying Apocalypse World games have players who make things happen.  The structure of the game as a series of moves, and the explicit list of moves that the GM may make, really steer the game in the direction of active players and reactive GM.  This delights me: I have been running games to find out what happens, and not to tell players a story, for over two decades now, and to have a rules system that embraces and supports this so beautifully is a joy.  But the reason I find it diagnostically useful is that it really shows up the differences between active, reactive, and passive players: the wrong proportion of active players can cause Apocalypse World to fail more obviously than most other games.  And when I say, "I don't know, what *do* you eat in the winter?"  Or "Fido is banging on your door, and you can see that if he bangs hard enough he'll just break it down.  You can hear him pacing, and he's shouting your name - 'Tum Tum! Get the fuck out here! I gotta talk to you!'  What is he so upset about?  Is he mad at you?  What's keeping him from just breaking your door down?" -- it demonstrates to me which players are willing to take partial ownership of the world, and which are expecting me to tell them a story.<br/><br/>And Burning Wheel - I've tried twice with two different groups, with varying degrees of success.  The critical feature of BW that I find helpful in this diagnostic vein is that it doesn't run smoothly unless the players learn at least some of the rules and take responsibility for some of the mechanics.  There are many games with this property -- most of the FATE games share it, for instance, because a player who doesn't bother to understand and use compels and invokes is never going to have a character that does anything particularly dramatic or memorable -- but Burning Wheel fails more obviously and more dramatically than most.<br/><br/>It seems odd to me that I like these games because they break so dramatically when you play them "wrong" -- but I think that indicates to me that they are concrete arguments in favor of system mattering.  When you play them with an approach that lines up with the game philosophy that they were created under, they produce amazing results.  When you play them with a different approach, they fail.  They are also, in different ways, concrete indictments of the "GM is god and director, players are supplicants and actors" philosophy that seems to permeate a lot of game styles I don't care for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DarkMoonINC" title="DarkMoonINC"><img alt="DarkMoonINC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DarkMoonINC">DarkMoonINC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401802/#Comment_401802" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-26T23:27:36+00:00" title="December 26, 2012 11:27PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apocalypse World<br/><br/>Why it's essential: I have never played in or run this game. Most likely with who I end up playing with, I never will. Not my thing, I prefer systems more like FATE or Cortex+. However, this book is on my top five list. Because, to put it quite simply, of Baker's amazing narrative and advice. The way he talks about playing and storytelling has changed the entire way I see games. How to force players to take an active charge in creating the game world and pursuing character motivation.<br/><br/>Between this and Fiasco, I've finally come to grips with character death. Not only come to grips, but it brings me a bittersweet relief to see a character spiral out of control and destroy themselves. Like watching Breaking Bad or The Departed. Apocalypse world is one of the most amazing reads you will ever experience, even if you never play the actual game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
