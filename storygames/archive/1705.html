                    Okay, so I'm trying to work out some game-structuring and scene-framing mechanics, right, so I need to think of all the different things that scenes might do.  I'm trying to atomize scene purposes as much as possible, with the patent understanding that most scenes do more than one thing at the same time.<br/><br/><strong>Introduce a character</strong><br/>A character strides or stumbles or is thrown onto the stage.  First impressions are made of the character.<br/><br/><strong>Introduce an element of a character</strong><br/>This elaborates on the audience's understanding of the character thus far.  This develops and complicates the character, and sometimes opens up new opportunities for the direction of the overall story.<br/><br/><strong>Introduce an element of the setting</strong><br/>The scene either uses a new set (and here we are in the library!) or introduces new information about a set (you can find some books on that in the library).  Alternately, it can present some fundamental mechanical function of the fictional world (every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings!).<br/><br/><strong>Relate a character to an element of the setting</strong><br/>Take a character and explain their relationship to the setting -- either "Hi, I'm the librarian here" or "I hang out in the library all the time" or "I donated half the books in the library" or whatever.<br/><br/><strong>Relate an element of the setting to another element</strong><br/>Relatively rare, because it's hard not to do this with boring exposition.  The usual workaround is to introduce a character who stands in for an element of the setting and then relate the character to another element of the setting (instead of expositing that the city trades with the tribes, introduce a tribesman who comes to the city to trade).<br/><br/><strong>Introduce a conflict*</strong><br/>We are well-versed in this one.  Oh no, something happens!  Character + Desire + Obstacle!<br/><br/><strong>Escalate a conflict</strong><br/>Increasing the thematic impact of a conflict.  Stakes are raised, new methods are introduced, and the conflict's "footprint" expands.<br/><br/><strong>Complicate a conflict</strong><br/>Taking an already established conflict and complicating it by adding more details that do not <em>escalate</em> the conflict, but provide more points of view and more motivations, often at cross-purposes to what has already been established.<br/><br/><strong>Resolve a conflict</strong><br/>Unknot the character+desire+obstacle equation, often through reincorporation of elements that were introduced earlier in the game.<br/><br/><strong>Denouement of conflict</strong><br/>This is sort of a clean-up function after a conflict or series of conflicts have been resolved, satisfying the audience's curiosity of what happens afterwards or what the resolution of the conflict means in the longer term.<br/><br/>* I'm actually not sure if the "conflict" items are on the same sort of level as those that come before this one, since you can, for instance, introduce a conflict by introducing a character to serve as the obstacle.  The conflict-manipulation scene purposes seem to be more intents rather than actions.<br/><br/>What other things can be done in a scene?                </div>

                            I'm not positive whether escalating and complicating are really different or not, but there is <em>something</em> in there, some variance or range of possibilities, that I want to sink my teeth in and pull apart.  Cause revealing that the antagonist is only doing what he's doing out of misplaced loyalty is a least somewhat different than deciding to get serious and smack the antagonist with a shovel, you know?  Complication seems to me to be "but it's not that simple" while escalation seems to be "now it's serious."  Sort of like breadth and depth.                        </div>

                            I guess you can complicate without escalating, but you can't escalate without complicating.  Which suggests a dependency...                        </div>

                            I think there need to be more "resolution" types of things. Games don't constantly add things to play, at some point things get removed, the game moves on.  A lot of times this happens without a scene but not always.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, there should be a "celebrate an element" scene, that can be a character or a conflict or just a piece of backdrop. When I throw 100 ninjas at the hawt vigilante chick with a sword in my Gotham City Adventure! game, I'm not accomplishing anything except showing she can beat 100 ninjas and how fucking cool is THAT.                        </div>

                            I dunno.  To me, a shouting match turning into a fist fight doesn't really seem to be complicating much, just escalating.  Nothing new is being said but the medium of the conflict is changing.  Alternately, it may be worthwhile or at least enlightening to atomize escalation.                        </div>

                            Consequences become more severe and constrained if you clock some dude instead of just yelling at him - that's always complicating.  That's what I was thinking, anyway.  <br/><br/>Jason - Hawt girl's anti-ninja awesome-ness is a setting or character element.  Probably both.                        </div>

                            Escalation comes in two varieties--scope and scale. Scope refers to the area of influnce, while scale intensity. Maybe this is what you're getting at with "complications"?<br/><br/>Scale would be arguing with your boss and he says, "I'm not going to demote you, I'm going to fire you".<br/>Scope would be, "I'm going to demote you and your fellow co-cospirators."<br/><br/>Hmmm... or does complications infer that the conflict has changed focus in some matter?

                            This reminds me a lot of Scott McCloud's stuff (Understanding/Reinventing/Making Comics), especially about the 6 different types of transitions between comic panels:<br/><br/>1. Moment to Moment (a single action portrayed in a series of moments)<br/>2. Action to Action (a single subject in a series of actions)<br/>3. Subject to Subject (a series of changing subjects within a single scene)<br/>4. Scene to Scene (transitions across significant dimensions of time or space)<br/>5. Aspect to Aspect (transitions from one aspect of a place, idea, or mood to another)<br/>6. Nonsequiter (a series of seemingly nonsensical, unrelated images and/or words)<br/><br/>These, I would argue, are good descriptions of transitions between individual "instances" of play, but they also recommend a few different purposes for scenes in general.<br/><br/>Like, if we're playing out a scene and, all of a sudden, one player says "Somewhere across town, a man slips on a banana peel." That's a little scene based on a nonsequiter transition, but I don't see it described by any of the things mentioned yet.  Sure, it's an extreme example, but it could be used with great effect in certain kinds of games (comedy, arthouse, Octane).                        </div>

                            What about: increase the significance of an element of the setting? (There's probably a better way to put that.) For example, some papers have been lying on the desk, they've got casual mention in a previous scene, now we discover that one of them is a letter which reveals some vital piece of information. Or Uncle Bilbo came back from his adventure with this cool ring that turns you invisible - HOLY CRAP it's the One Ring to Rule them All!<br/><br/>Like that.                        </div>

                            Jason, I think Celebrate an Element is probably a good call, cause I think you're right in that it has a place that is not especially related to the progress of plot or story.<br/><br/>On the complicate/escalate tack, almost all of that I'd call escalation.  By complication, I mean taking a conflict that's been established as being about one thing and layering it so that it's about another thing, as well.  Generally speaking, I'm not talking about stuff in the heat of the moment, but in the building up to the climax and resolution.  Stuff like, in an episode/issue/adventure when the young upstart is trying to prove himself to the old veteran, there's a scene where the old veteran explains to some third character that he sees promise in the upstart but doesn't want him to fall into the same traps that the veteran did.  So now the conflict isn't just "does the upstart prove himself" but "does the upstart prove himself and does the veteran prevent the same mistakes being repeated?"  In the crudest terms, you go from two resolution options to four, and even then the resolution of the two issues will reflect on each other no matter what you do.<br/><br/>The McCloud stuff is interesting; I'd like to see some more development along those lines in game structure.  Ron has talked about crosses and weaves and whatnot, but it might be interesting to get down even further to discrete techniques.                        </div>

                            I keep thinking 'Foreshadowing' belongs in here somewhere, though perhaps mostly as a specific form of the 'introduce ' thing.  You could either have foreshadowing by introducing something you intended to escalate later, or by escalating something later that you had introduced earlier (making the earlier introduction 'Foreshadowing' ipso facto).                        </div>

                            Interesting thought, Mike.  Maybe?<br/><br/>Most of the possible combinations make sense, but there are some odd combos.  What would "escalate character" mean?  What abobut "resolve setting?"<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that conflicts (and mysteries) are of a different order than character and setting, though.  Conflicts seem to be relationships among characters and setting, rather than a thing unto themselves.

                            I don't insist on it, though it would be kind of nice if you could come up with a fractal process that applied at all levels.<br/><br/>Maybe escalating character is the same as introducing new character elements (while complicating character is making linkages)? Or perhaps it's increasing the importance of the existing elements - or of the character themselves?<br/><br/>Resolve setting - the setting is changed, it's no longer the setting we came into.<br/><br/>Try these definitions:<br/><br/>* Introduce: self-explanatory, we see something we haven't seen before.<br/>* Escalate: the whatever-it-is gains more significance to the story, its story weight increases, we notice it more, losing it would matter more.<br/>* Complicate/correlate: the thing forms relationships with other things of the same or different types such that A affects B or vice versa or both.<br/>* Resolve: the thing goes through a process of transformation (which can include destruction or removal).<br/><br/>I suspect that it's actually going to be fairly difficult to think of examples of escalation that don't work by complication/correlation. The conflict is more important because more things that we value depend on its outcome. The character is more important because we know him better and we like him now. The ring is more important because it belongs to the Dark Lord and he wants it back.<br/><br/>Can someone come up with a counterexample where a thing can escalate in importance without forming a relationship (or perhaps being affected through a relationship it has already)?                        </div>

In the dramatic writing biz, we have a phrase: Every scene has a 'turn.'<br/>

I think if you replace "complicate a conflict" with, "the scene turns," a couple of things are going to fall into place.<br/>

                            I wonder if dialog should be tossed in there as it's own thing. We played contenders recently, and it specifically sets it up so that the other players play the NPCs that your player is involved with.  When you get two people driving play in that way, what you get isn't necessarily conflict, but I think it's more than just introducing or relating a character to something in the scene. Maybe "developing a relationship between characters" would be a good way to describe it.                        </div>

Easy: Dogs.  We're arguing.  I pull a gun.<br><br>As for a universal fractal pattern to it, I think there is one, but it would have to treat characters/setting/elements-of-fiction differently than conflicts/mysteries/structures-of-narrative.  Introducing a character is a pretty fundamentally different thing than introducing a conflict; a character is a guy that shows up on screen, while a conflict is a <em>relationship</em> between elements of the fiction.

Christopher, I think "the scene turns" probably describes a lot of different possible things: the scene could turn by revealing hidden motivations, by the bridge collapsing beneath their feet, by the President making a surprise visit.  So while yes, I'm trying to get at that scene-turn sort of thing, I'm trying to pick apart all of the possible means and reasons to do that.<br><br>Actually, the scene's turn is probably a better term than the scene's purpose; I may coopt that. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>

<br/>
Well, this may or may not help...<br/>
<br/>
But the scene turns only matters in the context of the protagonist. Does it matter if the bridge collapses or the President visits, or whatever...? Only if it matters to the characters we're invested in. All of your examples are tools (and there's an infinite number of them) to turn the scene for the character.<br/>
<br/>
So the character is in a scene, there's conflict, it's escalating.... and then something happens/occurs/arrives/is said/whatever that doesn't deflate the coflict, but puts things in a new perspective.<br/>
<br/>
"Complicating" a conflict without this kind of turning is just stuff.<br/>

                            Christopher, I think we're talking about the same thing with different words.  Yeah, the President arriving and nobody cares is bogus.  One assumes the protagonist(s) or somebody they care about is on the bridge that's collapsing, or else it's an irrelevant detail.<br><br>Let me ask you this, though: does the scene really turn for the character, or does it turn for the audience?  If the protagonist is advancing on the badguy who says something that matters to some parallel conflict that another protagonist is involved in, but the protagonist in this scene doesn't understand or register the importance, would you still call that a turn?  Where the audience is all wide-eyed because <em>they've</em> put it together, but the principals haven't yet?<br><br>Bad example: Luke jumps in the X-Wing and takes off.  Yoda chat with Ghosty Wan Kenobi, and says, out of Luke's earshot, "No, there is another."  Referring to Leia, which isn't revealed until the next movie, I think, but had fans speculating forever.  Would that count as a turn for you?                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I know what you're talking about, and that does hapen. And that's cool.<br/>
<br/>
But what I'm describing is about the protagonist. But remember, we're watching and caring *through* the protagonist. (If you will.) So we do care.<br/>
<br/>
What you're describing to me seems kind of intellectual (though valid and fun!). What I'm talking about recquires *the actor's face to register the change.*<br/>
<br/>
John McClain arrives in L.A. He's picked up at the airport, driven to the office building where his wife is a the company Christmas party. He's trying to reach his wife. He goes to the touch screen to find out what floor she's on and sign in on the Guest Security System. It's not working. The guard suggests he try to use maiden name. It comes up. She's using her maiden name. Bruce Willis reacts. That's the turn. Then the guard says, "Okay, you can go on up." Conflict (get past the guard of my wife's employers) is resolved.<br/>
<br/>
The value of the scene isn't about the conflict of will he get to his wife. It's about the turn. The conflicts are just basting sauce for the turn. (That scene has lots of stuff: Exposition about the security system, McClain being blocked from his wife by uniformed representatives of her company and so on, there's even a kind of conflict... Will he get past the guard... But it's not like he did anything cool to win the conflict...)<br/>
<br/>
But.... I may be taking this all afield from what you're going for. I *think* it's a good point. But I'm not sure what you're going after.<br/>

                            Car chase scenes might not always be conflict scenes, but the best ones are.  Take the famous one from The French Connection: the conflict is whether or not Popeye will catch the bad guys.<br><br>Of course, as Christopher implies in his Die Hard example, most scenes do more than one thing.  So, the car chase in FC also shows us something about Popeye's character: how far he will go to achieve his goals - how he will risk his life and the lives of innocent people to catch the crooks.<br><br>The scene also lets us appreciate some awesome stunt driving.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I don't want to add in unnecessary terminology, but I'm thinking now that a car chase (or a sword fight) acts as the idiom (?) for escalating or complicating the conflict or showing off an element of the character or setting of the character etc.                        </div>

                            I might even go so far as to add 'familiar idiom' or 'genre element' to the list of things you can add in a scene.  Because while it's possible and desirable to add more than just a car chase in a scene, examples abound to the contrary, where the only reason something exists is because it's genre/expected.  Certainly in D&amp;D 'the scene where the characters fight another monster' is sometimes just there because it's expected.                        </div>

Enh.  Just because a proton is almost always accompanied by an electron doesn't mean it's not useful to talk about them as separate things, and then define their relationship.  Even if what actually happens might be hard to separate from each other, it seems like it's probably useful to talk about them as separate concepts.<br><br>(In this particular example, I can at least imagine someone playing Dogs 'to win', and escalating not for an in-game reason, but because they'll get more dice by doing so.  But again, it seems like semantic froofraw to belabor the point.)                        </br></br></div>

                            Yep, lots of semantics here being argued by example.<br/>
<br/>
Josh is trying to make some discrete categories here. Let's try to help him find boundaries, not attack his terminology.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise he's going to start calling "Escallation" fliberdygibbet, and "Complication" nox-nox....<br/>
