I am looking for people who are willing to commit to playtesting my game in development, The Final Girl, sometime in the next three months. The Final Girl is a horror movie RPG where who will survive to make it to the end is truly in doubt.<br/><br/>The commitment required is very small. A single session of The Final Girl typically plays in 1.5 - 2.5 hours and requires at minimum 3 or 4 people.<br/><br/>If you're interested and can commit to doing this, let me know.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tyler" title="Tyler"><img alt="Tyler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tyler">Tyler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289976/#Comment_289976" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T13:20:03+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  1:20PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bret,<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure my folks would be happy to playtest this.   They like the genre and are used to playing critically.  We played Geiger Counter (by Jonathon Walton) and really enjoyed it, so I think we could be helpful.  Also, I've made audio recordings of AP in the past and would be happy to do that if it would benefit you.  You can email me at sinistraphobia@gmail.com.<br/>\n<br/>\nTyler                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
