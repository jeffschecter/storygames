I'd prefer to try and stay positive here. There's plenty of places to talk about why 'the system' (or aspects of it) doesn't work, can't work, is doomed to fail, and whose fault that is. I am hoping to hear ideas, no matter how crazy, for how to reinforce or productively replace it with something new that involves everyone.<br/><br/>-Jim C.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_391287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391287/#Comment_391287" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-25T06:19:27+00:00" title="September 25, 2012  6:19AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sadly, that link goes to a blog aggregator (<a href="http://networkedblogs.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://networkedblogs.com</a>) and not the specific blog post.

(It's the first one on the Black Diamond Games blogroll.) I understand the intent but in the end, the uniques, if they get enough attention become usefuls. Apocalypse World was a unique (and by many accounts still is) but is becoming a useful. Little of the content changed, only perception of the content changed (or grew). In some cases, yes, the uniques are uniques and will always be that way but with persistence and talent a unique may become useful to a retailer. Can a designer turn out a product? Can they build a fanbase? Without both they'll never move from unique to useful. What I've come to learn is that in many cases, you have to build the fanbase. Occasionally if you get a mavin, your fanbase can be built by them but it's not the only way and it's not really the best way for the community. Each member of the community needs to choose their own way.<br/><br/>This is what I see as the biggest obstacle in a community (not just RPGs). There is a hostility towards unchampioned products that some would actually enjoy. My attitude is not to try and stop the designers of these products but to help them. Did they miss the mark somewhere? I'm not going to tell them to stop trying. I'll do my best to identify what doesn't work for me and give constructive criticism. Do I perceive a barrier? How would I overcome it? How would even try? It's only when we celebrate the efforts in our community, big and small, that we'll be able to help a unique become a useful. Let's help them turn out a product and help them build a fanbase. In a way, isn't that one of the reasons forums like Story Games exists, to share new stories?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391296/#Comment_391296" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-25T07:41:48+00:00" title="September 25, 2012  7:41AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2012 7:46AM by J_Walton.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I assume the post Jim means is <a href="http://blackdiamondgames.blogspot.com/2012/09/battle-of-uvps.html" rel="nofollow">this one.</a><br/><br/>That's really interesting, Jim. Honestly, I think there's often a huge disconnect between indie game designers and retailers and more communication is definitely a worthwhile goal.<br/><br/>Speaking of goals, I think one of the things missing from this discussion is that game designers and retailers often have fundamentally different goals, which is part of what leads to the situation Gary is describing. When people like Ron Edwards, Vincent Baker, and Paul Czege shift away from IPR and distribution in general, and fulfill games solely on their own, one personal retailer relationship at a time, despite being easily able to sell many more copies through retail and distribution by other methods, there are clearly other things going on.<br/><br/>While there are some game designers that are "hybrid" types that think more in business terms (Fred Hicks and Brennan Taylor come to mind, as standout members of this rare breed), most of the indie game designers I've met are not especially concerned about selling the most copies of their games that they can, much less specifically designing games to meet the needs of a wide market of potential players. Some are actually actively hostile to the idea of writing games for the mass market, because they don't find such games or that audience particularly interesting or valuable, but most I think simply have other priorities. Ron and other folks have also historically pushed designers to write games for non-gamers, viewing that as a much larger and more interesting audience than the existing gamer market, though one that's much harder to connect to when they don't know about the hobby and are much harder to connect to in large numbers.<br/><br/>On the one hand, creating games that are simple-yet-deep, catchy and instantly fun but providing a payoff over the long run, ones that have the potential to be super successful, is a tough task. Lots of people attempt it and aren't that successful. But, on the other hand, it's not THAT hard, right? Given a knowledgeable, experienced, and well-rounded game designer (especially one that's relatively up-to-date on contemporary game design developments), that should be able to come together, especially working together. But, honestly, that's not what most folks are engaged in, because they got into game design to make the ideosyncratic things that they love. <br/><br/>Even when those games do exist, the game designers behind them aren't actively engaged in producing them in a format that caters directly to mass gaming audiences, but instead create them for players like themselves, the ones they are already engaged with. So they're often PDF-only documents with little explanation for general audiences. Or short books and booklets that don't read as "games" the way a boxed set or card-based product would (which are also more expensive and difficult to produce). Or aren't capable of generating the content necessary for the "supplement treadmill" that sustains products and sales in traditional gaming retail audiences.<br/><br/>Given all that, it's not that surprising, I don't think, that most indie game designers make a thing for the audience they know, enjoy selling a few hundred copies and winning "local" praise and accolades, and then move on to the next thing. What they want to do is create more games and follow their desires, not push the same product for multiple years, growing it bigger and bigger but essentially doing the same thing over and over. There are a few folks who do take that latter route (Luke Crane with Burning Wheel, for example, or Fred and Rob with Spirit of the Century and the Fate brand more broadly), and they tend to be the most successful at developing a broad and lasting following around their games. Retailers love them. I've seen many game stores whose only indie titles are SOTC and Burning Wheel, for very good reasons. But those designers who can really love one of their own projects to the extent that they can support it for decades are pretty rare. Most folks are more fickle than that, at least in my experience.<br/><br/>So, while I don't think Gary's vision of a more productive designer/retailer relationship is crazy, I think there are some very strong forces working against it, including trends among indie game designers to give up on the retail market entirely, despite strong relationships with retailers like Chris Hanrahan, because it's not seen as being necessary for the levels of "success" that many game designers are reasonably satisfied with, especially given Kickstarter and other new tools for reaching markets directly, and the relatively lack of interest in producing mass market games that would require distribution and retail.<br/><br/>Maybe there are game designers who could become interested in producing the next Magic or Pokemon-type seller, even just as a provocative design challenge (honestly, that's how it appeals to me as a game designer: not in terms of sales but in terms of how would I make a product that shared those traits Gary is hinting at), but I doubt the Venn-diagram of the designers capable of making that kind of game successfully and the ones that actually would WANT TO contains very many people. Perhaps most of those designers are already working successfully in more lucrative fields than tabletop games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391310/#Comment_391310" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-25T09:53:44+00:00" title="September 25, 2012  9:53AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Much depends on whether you think retailing has hit bottom or whether there's many more miles of free-fall to go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391318/#Comment_391318" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-25T10:23:46+00:00" title="September 25, 2012 10:23AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would love retailers to educate designers on what customers want.

My understanding is that retailers were losing sales because customers saw that they could get the PDF online, which was both useful (searchable, portable,etc.) and cheaper. They faced a dilemma of either getting something in print and supporting their FLGS or getting something in PDF. The <a href="http://www.bits-and-mortar.com/" rel="nofollow">Bits and Mortar</a> initiative (which is a free, volunteer marketing effort organized by Fred Hicks) removes the dilemma, giving them both versions for the price of the print book and making the FLGS the customer's smartest option again.<br/><br/>It also works well because it entrusts the retailers with the power to distribute the PDFs themselves, meaning they are more involved and have the opportunity to see the PDFs themselves. That way they can be more informed and better able to sell the games in the first place.<br/><br/>Thanks to the Durance Kickstarter surveys, I recently had the opportunity to ask several stores how we could better help them sell our games. Bits and Mortar was one suggestion (we're already on it), but several asked for sell sheets, promotional flyers, and posters that they could use to teach their staff to better pitch the game. I suppose having a flyer taped to the counter that gets customers to ask about it in the first place is even better.<br/><br/>Another suggestion (which we've been meaning to do for a long time) is to have a list of supporting retailers on our website, ideally right next to the "Buy Now" button. In other words, when the customer is ready to buy, help them find out if they could buy it locally first. <br/><br/>Ultimately I think that what customers really need from retailers is not product (a single game or a thousand supplements) but experience. They want the store staff to be knowledgeable, able to tell them about games in a way that online reviews can't. They want to be able to meet other players, and perhaps play games with them at store events. The retail store is about community, and my guess is that those that find ways to make money on events are going to be most successful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391372/#Comment_391372" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-25T19:53:21+00:00" title="September 25, 2012  7:53PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2012 7:53PM by Scrape.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a whole gaming culture and it's social <i>by nature</i>, so good game shops should be tapped into that culture, right at the center of it. They should be backing Kickstarters at the retailer level, advertising those games in the store, and then hosting sessions of the game as well. I don't think digital distribution is necessarily poison for a brick and mortar gaming stores. Unlike, say, a record shop, there's a tangible benefit to your flgs: gaming is a face-to-face hobby and the shop <i>should</i> be where you go to meet gamers. A good store (like yours, Jim) has multiple monthly or weekly events that gather customers. <br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying is 'synergy' but I'm not gonna say that word, ugh.<br/><br/>(on a kinda related note, if more people published digest-sized books instead of big clunky hardcovers, I would never buy the pdf version instead)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391523/#Comment_391523" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T23:20:34+00:00" title="September 26, 2012 11:20PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, trying to get other retailers to think of selling Indie RPGs like they're board games rather than the traditional expensive supplement treadmills they perceive all RPGs to be is a major mission of mine. <br/><br/>I want to make abundantly clear I'm not talking exclusively about retailers here.
