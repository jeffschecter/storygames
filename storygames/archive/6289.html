I had voiced my desire to have a more serious game of PE, to tap into both the horror-potential and adolescent cruelty-potential of the game. Though it got off to a somewhat hi-jink-y start, by the end we had a creepy, Lain-esque realitybending vibe, and some character relationships brimming to explode.<br/><br/>It was awesome, but there was something lacking, that I couldn't put my finger on.<br/><br/>Then when I got home I had an epiphany about what it is I'm looking for in a Panty Explosion game. Yeah, I said I wanted "serious," but I don't think that gets to the core of it. What i really want is a story about relationships and rivalry and pain. "Serious" is an element of that, but more as a side effect. In fact, if we're getting that kind of story, it doesn't so much matter if humor creeps in or even permeates it. Something can be funny as hell and still have a heart-wrenching core. Take Kodomo no Omacha for example. What I'm really looking for is that core story.<br/><br/>It seems to me that starting everyone out in class together has an effect on play assumptions, specifically in nudging toward a team-oriented approach to play. In other words, if you're all grouped together for some task, and it's you all vs. the assignment or you all vs. the Teacher, then PCs are going to tend to clump together and solve problems together and become something of a close-knit circle. An occasionally bickering circle, perhaps, but still a group of friends united for or against something.<br/><br/>That's not really how I'd like to play Panty Explosion.<br/><br/>I really take the descriptions of angst and social cruelty in the book to heart. I look at the Best Friend and Rival selection as a powerful tool for crafting our story together, not just a character quirk with a cute little narration mechanic attached. I want to capitalize on that and other rules aspects to craft moving stories of alienation, love, betrayal, and desperation.<br/><br/>Here's what I'd like to do with a future PE game: Don't start everyone in class together or anything like that. I know it has the utility of getting everyone involved at once, but it has the disadvantages I outlined above. Instead, I'd look at the BF and Rival assignments and open with some smaller scenes. Take the first Player and do a scene with their Girl and her best Friend, and possibly her Best Friend if you've got a fairly large play group. The scene will be about one of the girls' Rivals, probably one Girl trying to get her Best Friend on her side against the rival (you could think of this as a sort of "tutorial" conflict <i>a la</i> Dogs' Initiations). But in any case, do a short little scene that highlights and foreshadows the relationships between the characters. Then go around the table and do another such scene with two more Girls. Probably about three scenes, with at least one character overlapping somewhere, would be best. That would set up a nice juicy network of emotionally relationships that has more subtlety than "We're all friends!" or "Popular Girls vs. Geek Girls!" or whatever.<br/><br/>I'd like to see how this works out. I think it would really juice up the relationship angle of play and give the characters real connections without that "playing before play" phenomenon where everyone talks for a good half an hour about what their characters "did" and "said" to each other in the past, without actually roleplaying. And it would kick off the story with just the right sense of pacing and atmosphere. In a tale about rivalry and adolescent pain, you would expect to open on a scene with two girls gossiping about a third, don't you think?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139347/#Comment_139347" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-11T19:35:03+00:00" title="April 11, 2008  7:35PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...I think that, if there is ever a sequel/next edition of that game, it should be called:<br/><br/>Serious Panty Explosion<br/><br/><br/>(Aside from that, I can't really comment, never having played the game.

Small scenes with just a few girls that lead up to larger and longer scenes is the best way to start a game. Unfortunately we had a very short amount of time to play. In situations like that, I find that one or two scenes with all the characters works best, in the sense that it jump starts the game and gets everyone involved. If we return to this game, I'd like to do some smaller character oriented scenes and start working to drive wedges between the girls. That's the real job of  the Demon in the game.<br/><br/>PE can also be a bit much if it's your first time playing and there are a lot of players. Seth, Nathan and Mike we're new to the game, and not really sure how to handle the narration duties of the Best Friend and Rival. They did a great job, but I think if they had been more familiar with the game, that scene would have gone quicker. I see that a lot with large games and new players. I think if we play again we'll see scenes of the same complexity that go a little faster. Just a little experience goes a long way.<br/><br/>But yeah, that was an awesome game. Glad you had fun                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139537/#Comment_139537" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-13T17:47:00+00:00" title="April 13, 2008  5:47PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, sounds like my "brilliant new idea" is nothing more than "how you play Panty Explosion." Curse you Richmond!<br/><br/>I guess I've not encountered that mode of play with PE, having only done a couple of one-shots so far. I'd dearly love to try play in that mode. If we do a second session, then yeah, we can definitely introduce more of that into play. I still think there's something to be said for getting <i>off</i> on the right foot in the first place. Maybe if I actually run a game myself sometime. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Speaking of which:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jake richmond</cite>That's the real job of  the Demon in the game.</blockquote>\nOh god, that's so bloody obvious, yet I never made that connection.

If we had made it to the next scene I would have started driving wedges, and it would have become more obvious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
