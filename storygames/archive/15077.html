They have been considered guilty of the massacre by the crowd who saw the accident. They barricated in the house, while a few of policemen are trying to stop the crowd.<br/><br/>Main characters:<br/><br/>April, a journalist in search of a scoop about androids. She placed the bomb (although the idea was that it should have been found before exploding), and incited the crowd, although others are unaware of all this.<br/>Jason, formerly a drug addict, whose mother died during the explosion. He is lookink for redemption, and wants to whoever set the bomb.<br/>Marcus, an ex-soldier, explosives specialist. He was in the supermarket because April lured him there. She thought he was an android, and decided to use him as a scapegoat. He knows April since the war, when she was a field reporter.<br/>Giulia, a girl whose brother (also present inside the house) has been badly wounded during the explosion; she wants to save him. They know noone else in the building, and both sympathize with androids.<br/><br/>For the purpose of having a neutral ground between inside the house and outside it, the building's garden and porch have been included in the location.<br/><br/>The game flowed very pleasantly, and that specific situation has been a powerful engine for narration. Lots of potential. From the very beginning we've been having very intense scenes: The first one involved some NPCs who wanted to rape a young girl, just to have some fun before throwing her to the outside crowd (a scene in which Jason intervened to save the girl). The second one was a scene in which I tried to use the few medicines in the house in order to stabilize my brother.<br/>The game continued through amiable scenes like these, involving mutual accusations, attempted rapes, characters left outside of the building and/or used as baits, and so on. The tension was everpresent, and after a while characters started thinking that it was safer outside of the building.<br/><br/>In the end, there were three android endings and an oblivion (caused by the game mechanic where the last character not yet having had a revelation will never be revealed as human or replicant). April wrote an article who won a Pulitzer, but it was published by the newspaper's editor with some adjustments, including April being pointed as the bomber (she was unaware of both the stealing and the charge).<br/>Jason, understood that he was in fact an android because he remembered the porch that appeared in his memory, the same as the story's building, but not the rest of the house; he wasn't able to tell that house from the others. He kept his identity, but sacrificed himself in order to let Giulia and her brother flee.<br/>Marcus understood he was an android because of the too many scars questioning his memory, with no solace alleviating them (5 blur/0 focus). He managed to escape, but everyone discovered his true identity thanks to a test took while in the army.<br/>Giulia also saved herself, but the crowd separated her from her brother and lynched him (Giulia's purpose was to save him, but since she could not reach it as she was an android, I chose this narration). She understood she was an android because she felt so little in front of the scene.<br/><br/>I hope this can give you a feeling of the game; if you have any question please ask!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342768/#Comment_342768" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-14T10:39:40+00:00" title="September 14, 2011 10:39AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Mauro!<br/>Thanks for your actual play!
