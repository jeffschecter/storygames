In a normal attack, the defender gets to move straight or diagonally backwards and the attacker has to follow into the empty space. The defender can stand their ground, which means the attacker gets combat advantage of +2 to-hit and damage. The attacker can attack defensively to not follow up, which means -2 to-hit or damage or -1 on each. <br/><br/>This has neatly solved our previous problem of static fights. What happened before was that PCs and monsters lined up and traded blows until one side fell or the monsters failed their morale roll. What happens with defensive movement is that each new round presents a new situation since combatants have moved around. <br/><br/>Now my question! If I want to ditch the miniatures and grid and go theater of mind, but keep each new round a new situation, what can I do? <br/><br/>One option is to keep a soft version of defensive movement, which works if you fight next to an important piece of scenery. If you attack someone in a doorway, you step through the door as part of the attack and can be attacked by the two monsters waiting on each side behind the door. This doesn't work in the middle of the room, where the grid version would still create new situations. <br/><br/>It's not a requirement to faithfully recreate defensive movement in theater of mind. What I'm after is some way of changing the situation from round to round based on what everyone does to keep players from just repeating \u201cI attack\u201d. I\u2019ve thought about limiting what you can or can\u2019t do based on previous narration, but I haven't found a way to combine it with OSR combat resolution. <br/><br/>Any suggestions on how to avoid static exchanges of blows in theater of mind?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457690/#Comment_457690" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-30T19:16:00+00:00" title="October 30, 2016  7:16PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you have the right idea: each "move" (turn) should, somehow, affect not just the hit points of the individuals, but also the tactical flow of the battle.<br/><br/>It may help to visualize any given combat arena as having various tactical features. Even on a perfectly flat, level surface, you could say there is a ridge or a crack, an area covered in sand, or a puddle of blood, which threatens to be slippery.<br/><br/>When you don't have a grid, then, instead, you can have each move/maneuver change the position of one or more characters relative to these features. You retreat through the door; you push your opponent into the blood slick on the stair; you're now within arm's reach of the statue; and so on.<br/><br/>This can work mechanically, too, if successful or failed rolls generate modifiers moving forward: perhaps you can choose between striking your opponent extra hard and building or maintaining a sort of "momentum" advantage moving forward, or make other rolls to create bonuses and penalties.<br/><br/>Also, though, don't forget the standard lessons of OSR-style play, and how to make it exciting. For instance, just <i>keeping hit points low</i> (i.e. low-level play) is enough to make combat exciting, since any one event has the potential of changing things very dramatically. So do things like Morale checks, unusual side effects from interrupted spell-casting, and so forth.<br/><br/>The higher hit points are on each side, the harder you're going to have to work to keep things dynamic and interesting.<br/><br/>I also recently read a neat article on differentiating weapon types in OSR-style games. Instead of modifying the amount of damage done, the house rules allowed various weapons different game rules. For example, if you have a sword, you have an advantage against your opponent whenever you win initiative, but a heavy weapon like a mace or hammer gives you a bonus against armoured targets. A small weapon (like a dagger) allows you to make double-damage attacks against an opponent if you've grappled with them - this makes a man with a knife dangerous in a very different way, should he decide to charge you!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457715/#Comment_457715" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-31T14:59:40+00:00" title="October 31, 2016  2:59PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I typically run D&amp;D in "theater of the mind" mode.

We can dress up "I hit" into multi-sentence descriptions, but there's still no new decision to be made unless the new fictional situation somehow limits or enables new things.<br/><br/>Before the grid and the defensive movements, you could write a very simple AI to handle our fights. Line up and trade blows. With defensive movement, you could find yourself flanked as a result of attacking, and it didn't even matter if you succeeded or failed your attack roll. Or you could find yourself off by one square so you couldn't attack the monster you wanted next turn. The AI wouldn't be much deeper, but at least a bit more complex. As I said, I don't need to recreate exactly this, but I want something to happen from round to round.<br/><br/>One limiting factor, in a sense, I haven't told you about is that I want to run pre-written modules as close to the text as possible. If there's a fire in the room, I can of course use it, or I can add a fire as a minor detail if plausible. But I won't be able to create a whole new set just for the fight.<br/><br/>I'm not adverse to adding new fictional developments if they force new decision, perhaps by limiting what the PC can do next. But I'm not sure how to tie that into the standard attack roll without stepping on other parts of the system. If, after an attack roll that does 3 of an orc's 5 HP, I add that it drops its sword, I've now given the player a free disarm move. What precedent has been set? "If you lose more than half of your HP... ?"<br/><br/>I could add status effects like "if the orc hits you with its club and you parry with your arm, your arm is broken either way" or "the orc's sword travels towards your eyes, and if the attack succeeds you're blind". That would change the situation for the next round, but it would be by adding something beyond HP to the attack. Whitehack has these status effects already, but they're tied to wanting to heal above 1 HP without finding a doctor.<br/><br/>I've actually been sketching on a system for pressing, circling, engaging, etc, since my last post. I'll post it here, but I'm still interested in hearing about how other groups have handled this. I'm not even sure this is how I want to handle it, just that I don't want to go back to trading blows.<br/><br/>SYSTEM SKETCH<br/>One side always have combat advantage (+2 to-hit and damage), and this advantage is transferred or kept depending on what you do this turn.<br/><br/>A normal attack means that the advantage is lost.<br/>A defensive attack means that the advantage is kept.

I'm genuinely interested.<br/><br/>Rickard, I like the idea of narrative obstacles, and that it can lead to a bit of verbal jousting between the player and referee. If I didn't worry about stepping on other parts of the system, it would be nice to disarm PCs with a successful attack roll, and have them roll on the ground next round to pick up their sword and strike, and so on. A good fight in a book or film always put the characters in situations where you briefly think "How are they going to handle this?!", only to have them pull off some cool move and continue the fight.

(Well, we actually had a big, fat climatic combat two weeks back, and played it with minis for the heck of it. Interesting change of pace, but a story for another time.) I'll try to lay out some hints:<br/><br/>First, length and structure of the combat round matters to me a lot. If it's too short, many combat events simply cannot occur round-by-round in good conscience, which encourages a static perspective on what happens during combat. My conceptual round length is "a single clash of arms, from the charge to separation, the length of intense action before the combatants are forced to catch their breath or look around to reorient themselves". I usually call it 60 seconds (post-round maneuvers included) when I need a number for somebody, but that's just a generic approximation; more complex and exhausting rounds are shorter due to the clash of arms being shorter, while calmer, slower types of combat mean longer rounds.<br/><br/>So anyway, I'm firmly in the "1 minute" end of the D&amp;D combat rules continuum in this regard, more like what AD&amp;D envisions than the 5-second Basic round (which I consider a mistake for various reasons). There are many dynamic consequences. As a single combat round encloses entire maneuvers, the fight will, generally, be different from one round to the next. A group can break through enemy lines during a single round and perhaps even exploit the opening, for example.<br/><br/>Second point: the skirmish combat environment, formed by multiple melees, is my primary canvas when it comes to varied combat terrain. The standard advice, seen in this thread as well, is to make the terrain in each individual combat unique and exciting - sort of like 4th edition D&amp;D. I don't really pre-plan combat environments, the combats occur wherever somebody draws their weapons, so this isn't an option. Nevertheless, each combat is unique, and the situations shift from round to round, thanks to the variety of melee arrangements that may occur through-out.<br/><br/>As a core tenet, consider this: during a combat round, every combatant engaged in active melee is actively threatening, and actively threatened by whoever they are fighting with; this is the very definition of engaging in melee, you're not actually doing it if you are not producing a moment-to-moment threat to your opposition. This fact means that whether you're using miniatures or not, the combat is not simply an arbitrary swirl of action; rather, it is a series of duels, chosen by the higher initiative count as they engage the opposition in whatever manner they may. This basic pattern of 1-vs-1 or 2-vs-1 or whatever the nature of the individual engagements has opportunities to shift between rounds, but it is no simple feat to merely abandon an active and bloodthirsty foe; there is a certain amount of stability to each duel, as long as it lasts, until either party is able to break away, or both decide to cease for the moment for whatever reason they may. It's not at all like a menu-based CRPG with the combatants neatly lined and trading arbitrary blows until one side's wiped out.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, each individual bout as described moves around in the combat space, causing subtle interaction with the environment and other combatants. Perhaps one or both sides attempt to maintain an organized front so as to prevent the opponent from ganging up or sidelining anybody, which then has its implications for the dynamism of the individual bout; perhaps there are walls present, curtailing opportunities sharply. There are chokepoints, and any combatants crowding in on action of others will cause confusion.<br/><br/>Third point: I play the psychological, social and cultural dimension of combat heavily, which makes individual combats unique even when the terrain is exactly the same. When the combatants have their own ways of doing things, their own reasons for fighting and their own attitudes towards pain and death, there are not only colorful descriptive opportunities, but lots of tactical nuances overlaid on top of the purely positional struggle. For example, consider how the particular combat deeds and their brutality affect the perception of the combatants on each side, causing them to be more or less amenable to a negotiated ending to the struggle. For another example, consider how very little attention a melee-engaged combatant, fighting for their life, can spare for other events occurring simultaneously in a dimly lit combat environment, and how the lack of information, the fog of war, will affect their decisions. All of these elements contribute to a rich tapestry that has little to do with the concrete terrain over which the combat is conducted.<br/><br/>All of these matters are, I find, about as natural to handle verbally as they are with miniatures, given the right conceptual frame in which to speak about them. Specifically, I avoid speaking about precise positioning in static terms, because the constant footwork of the combatants changes spatial positioning constantly. Instead, we talk about who is ganging up on whom, who is retreating and who is advancing, in which general part of the room the action occurs, and how much attention each individual combatant can or will afford to the events occurring around them.<br/><br/>Speaking of the details, I started to compile a list of standard concepts like "charging" and "opportunity attack" and "frontline" and "flanking attack" and so on, but ultimately all that goes into the details of the combat system heavily enough that I don't know how useful it'd be. I think it suffices to say that as long as the GM has the authority to decide on circumstances ("their attack pushes you against the wall, preventing a retreat through the doorway"), tactical play in verbal mode does not pose overwhelming difficulties. And if it is possible to discuss e.g. three different melee bouts occurring at once, each with their individual dynamics, then I don't think that it's very difficult to make every combat round unique: last round the enemy cleaved in between your lines, so what do you do now that half of you are cut off from the doorway altogether?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457753/#Comment_457753" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-01T12:00:10+00:00" title="November  1, 2016 12:00PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, do you have a link to the article on weapon differentiation?

I've been very lenient with my players, allowed swinging two-handed swords in 1.5 meter wide dungeon corridors, but it would be nice to make other weapons shine, especially the lowly knife as part of a grappling maneuver.<br/><br/>Adam, I like how the result of the attack is resolved by both the player and referee. In my experience, my players would probably give me very little "I hit him with my sword", and any resolution by me "He ducks under your sword and you trade places. You now have your back to the wall!" would sometimes be met by complaints. "If I knew that would happen, I wouldn't have attacked in the first place."<br/><br/>David, when I said "OSR", I meant I want to be able to add any mechanic more or less seamlessly to, say, B/X D&amp;D (or Whitehack, as is the case). I want to keep all the default stuff in place, attack roll, AC, HP, and so on, but if there's a neat mechanical way of changing the tactics from round to round to lift from any other game, that's nice.<br/><br/>Eero, your hints are very helpful. When you say "not at all like a menu-based CRPG", that's exactly what I want to avoid. It's not just some thought-experiment either. We had a fight break out as the PCs made camp on the open plains, and the resulting fight took place with no real features, just two sides of people that lined up and traded blows. I don't want to go back to that.<br/><br/>You said "as long as the GM has the authority to decide on circumstances", and this ties into what Adam said. I don't feel like I have that authority, or the authority is at least repeatedly challenged, which is why it was nice to switch to miniatures and a grid. I think I can reclaim some of the authority by briefly outlining what will happen as a result of an attack, instead of just springing it on the players after the dice have landed. "To attack, you will have to step through the door into the room, OK?" instead of saying after the fact that the attack took them into the room, to which the players might say "No, no, we just wanted to stick our swords through the door!" I think that the players, or at least one of the players, are afraid I will hose them completely if I move their PCs around. They tend to forget all the times things went their way and remember that time they were unfairly put on the spot.<br/><br/>I think that one thing I liked about the grid-based defensive movement was that it was impartial. It's like playing Blood Bowl, no interpretation needed. Moving the responsibility to change the tactical situation from round to round to the referee is of course OK, but then I guess what I'm grasping for is some kind of guidelines or default assumptions to base my interpretations on.<br/><br/>I think that two guidelines I can use is "It's never just an attack" to introduce movement and shifting positions, and "State the most probable resolution before rolling dice" to avoid "I didn't want to step into the room" moments.<br/><br/>In my system sketch above, I've realized that you only get to add combat advantage to to-hit and damage if you have advantage at the start of your round. Getting advantage this round will benefit your next round, unless the opponents take it back before then.<br/><br/>I wasn't clear on this, but I imagine that most combatants will be at "near" range if they're in the same room. Clusters of people, say two PCs vs one orc and two orcs vs two PCs, will be engaged in melee at the same time with their positions roughly described ("This group fights by the door and this group among the pillars in the room.") To disengage you have to spend your attack action on defending and your move action to move to the near range,  and next round you can engage a free opponent or a group that's already fighting. This can be useful for gaining combat advantage.<br/><br/>Keeping this grounded in the fiction will be the challenge, as it's easy for me to just write the groups down on a whiteboard and again start trading blows. I think I fall back to this habit when I want to resolve fights quickly, and if descriptions are only color, they tend to be ignored.<br/><br/>I haven't completely figured this out for myself yet, but everyone's input is very appreciated. It helps me think in new directions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457756/#Comment_457756" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-01T13:42:42+00:00" title="November  1, 2016  1:42PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting angle here - all this is much more difficult if the GM is <i>not</i> the primary maintainer of the fictional space. This isn't unknown to me by any means, as I run a consensual D&amp;D table (so there's no "it is so because I'm the GM" in my method), but for the most part the play culture seems to be happy with trusting in the GM's impartiality.<br/><br/>As you said, laying things out in advance is a good basic principle to fall back on. I use that early and often, really, and when players call me on the probity of some decision that I haven't cleared with them at some point, I usually end up falling back on it. Thinking about things, I think that creative impetus is the key thing here: I need to want to do things a certain way and I need to be able to verbalize why I want that, if I want to establish a functional working relationship with the players. It looks something like this, perhaps:<br/><br/><b>Me:</b> "OK, you miss the orc with your strike, and as they press you hard, you find yourself back to the wall, in danger of being surrounded."<br/><b>Player:</b> "Hey, why's that? I don't like my actions having negative consequences, and I don't see any connection between failing combat maneuvers and lost ground." (I'm caricaturing the position here a bit to make the point clearer.)<br/><b>Me:</b> "Hmm, yeah, I see what's going on here - we haven't talked about how I like to do things, because you/I joined this campaign only recently. So I've this thing where I want to have all sorts of chaotic secondary events occur in combat, so as to spice things up and create a background for the players to improvise upon; I don't want combats in the campaign to become too static. Our traditional solution has been to read combat checks for additional information, degrees of success if you will; thus a bad miss on a combat check can become a negative side factor for your character. This is still reasonably objective, because we go from the formal fact of the dice roll to the creative details I provide, yet it's also simple and quick, and the possibilities are limited only by the imagination."<br/><b>Player:</b> "I think it's quite unfair that I didn't know about this in advance. The idea you present is reasonable in itself, though, so if I were a saint I'd probably just let you get on with it, instead of trying to preserve my dignity by continuing to complain. After all, by opening my mouth I committed some of my social capital to this, so I can't drop the subject without making myself seem an idiot for taking it up in the first place."<br/><b>Me:</b> "Yeah, it's a complex game and we're learning as we go, particularly as the game quite intentionally doesn't have a static rulebook. I definitely do not expect you to know or remember all the rules - I don't myself, and I've at least been here in like 90% of the game sessions where the game's been developed. So how about we forget about that side narration for now, and follow the rule later on? This way I get what I want - a principled and nuanced combat environment - and you get what you want, too, as we acknowledge that your complaint was valid, and got a good talk about the rules we use, too. Plus your character doesn't die pinned by the orcs right here and now; I don't care, I can always kill him later in the next room."<br/><b>Player:</b> "Well OK, but I reserve the chance to think about this in length and come back to you with a better combat system."<br/><b>Me:</b> "I would love it if you did that. Most of the players traditionally just let me worry about designing the processes, so I'm more than happy to have somebody commit enough to the campaign to walk through these things with me."<br/><br/>Sorry for how lengthy that was, but I was trying to show a subtle interchange that might help in increasing the GM's authority over the long run: what I do is that I exchange my acknowledgement of legitimate player privileges (that I think are legitimate, I mean - I'm sure some people would abhor my thinking in that regard) for the players in turn respecting the procedures and privileges that I find crucial for performing the GM's job efficiently. Particularly, I will <i>always</i> exchange an immediate bribe for long-term acknowledgement of the rules, because of how very positive and constructive such an exchange is: the player gets to feel that they are being listened to, I'm corrected for my failing of logic or pedagogy (often it's the latter - I'm ruling correctly, but I forgot to tell the player the rule or fictional detail I'm basing myself on), and the actual rules we're following get an airing, so that everybody remembers them better from then on.<br/><br/>(Do I always reward the squeaking wheel? Yes, so far I have done so, although I will tell the players if I think that they are complaining about nothing. Apparently players childish enough to complain constantly just to get their way do not exist, even my 10-year old nephew respects my authority once I explain the reasoning and promise to be more careful with my descriptions in the future.)<br/><br/>Consequently, when the campaign goes through reformative periods, the reason for why I preserve the GM's privilege of being the primary conductor of fictional positioning is basically that I ask the other players for it nicely: hey guys, if it's OK with you, could we play so that I keep authoritative track of who's where and doing what? That's just the way I've found to be most effective for our shared agenda of having fluid, fair, detailed combat encounters. In exchange for you humouring me on this I shall continue being very flexible about the matters that you really care about, so it's really a negotiated exchange.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457757/#Comment_457757" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-01T13:42:50+00:00" title="November  1, 2016  1:42PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should also mention a few other details about my fiction-maintaining routine. One is that I always defer to reasonable player assumptions. This means that my personal picture of what's going on and who's where doesn't actually matter that much; it's much more important that we have <i>some</i> non-ambiguous facts than where those facts come from. Consequently, despite my primary responsibility as maintainer of the fiction, I tend to activate the players quite a bit, too. A basic way to do so is to ask questions about the fictive state. The most fundamental one is "Where are you again, now that this thing is going on", but you can ask whatever you need. The way the players answer, and whether they try for illegitimate advantage, will tell you a lot, and asking them to maintain the fiction with you will do a lot to move them away from the mindset of a child and into the mindset of a responsible adult. For the record, my experience is again that nobody intentionally tries to cheat when asked an earnest question; at most the players will make assumptions favourable to themselves on issues that have not been clearly delineated either way, but that's so minor most of the time that I don't really care - you want to be conveniently inside the room, then so be it, and next time I'll ask in advance if I really care.<br/><br/>Another basic detail about my routine is that I repeat what the players tell me in my own words. This isn't quite as simplistic as it sounds, as I tend to add the mechanization of the declared action, and the expected consequences, on top of the communication. It looks like this:<br/><br/><b>Player:</b> "I'll try to break in the door."<br/><b>Me:</b> "So you'll try to push the door open by sheer weight, throw yourself against it. Cool, roll a strength check and we'll see how it goes. DC is 20 for an instant success, 15 spends several minutes banging at it before it goes down."<br/><br/>When this habit of communication gets entrentched, it helps out a lot in filling out communication gaps, which in turn makes it much easier to maintain complex fictional maneuvers in purely verbal play. There are several effects here, one of the neatest of which I think is the way the means-goals dichotomy gets filled: players are in the habit of declaring either their means or their goal, but not both, so if you repeat what they said back at them from the other perspective, you'll ensure that every resolution cycle only hits the table once both the means and the goals have been explicitly uttered. Like so:<br/><br/><b>Player:</b> "I'll try to open the door by force"<br/><b>Me:</b> "So you'll try to batter it down, then, slam your bodyweight against it."<br/><br/><b>Player:</b> "I'll throw my weight at the door."<br/><b>Me:</b> "So you're trying to open it by force."<br/><br/>Another cool effect is that your restatement of the player action catches mutual misunderstandings - either one of you might be basing your understanding of the situation on flawed details, so the restatement ensures that you're close enough to correct on both sides to avoid having to argue about the results after the dice hit the table.<br/><br/>Yet another advantage is that even if the player didn't invoke any particular rules, your restatement can do so, and the player has an opportunity to query for detail or cancel the action before they move on to execution. This is also a natural spot for you to explain the consequences of the action - what rolls are needed, how those rolls will be interpreted, whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457776/#Comment_457776" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-01T22:01:57+00:00" title="November  1, 2016 10:01PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I often just tell players to narrate their own stuff and react to it.

It was ensconced in about a million other house rules!<br/><br/>Do you remember our OSR online game? Did you find that it achieved what we're talking about here? I believe the way I ran was similar to what Eero is discussing here - in particular, me as GM taking authority over the fictional space, and making it palatable to the players by erring in their favour whenever something seemed unclear.<br/><br/>Eero,<br/><br/>Fantastic posts! I love your examples, in particular. Excellent discussion, in any case; very revealing and very informative.<br/><br/>How you discussed anywhere why you feel shorter rounds are a "mistake"?<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Back to the general topic - a rules suggestion:<br/><br/>If your players don't find that kind of loose approach to is sufficient (it's certainly not as rigorous in terms of rule adjudication as what you're potentially looking for), you can try to encode some of this stuff into the rules.<br/><br/>Some examples:<br/><br/>1. When I use the old-school-D&amp;D 1d6 initiative roll, I use an idea I got from Eero, which is that the *difference* between the two rolls determines the length of an "exchange", in rounds. During that time, one side retains initiative.<br/><br/>I make "initiative" something that pays off fictionally, by giving that side some leeway about their fictional positioning. Sometimes this is more important than at other times: for instance, if the battle has two groups meeting on a bridge, the group which won initiative can decide whether they meet their enemy in the middle of the bridge, on one side, or the other. They get to choose where things take place.<br/><br/>On a tie, though. you don't have enough time to control exactly what's happening. Decide whether you want to:<br/> <br/>* Grab the initiative, throwing yourself into the chaos of melee!<br/> <br/>or<br/> <br/>* Cede the initiative, choosing where to make your stand before the enemy strikes.<br/><br/>I use that choice to really drive it home.<br/><br/>This might still be too loose for you, of course!<br/><br/>2. You could build "offers" into combat. Make them interesting enough, and you could get a lot of action happening.<br/><br/>One idea is the "stunt". <br/><br/>Option A: You say what you want to achieve (like a special type of attack, tripping the enemy, disarming them, etc). You make two attack rolls. If you succeed on both rolls, it happens! If you only succeed on one, you get what you wanted, but to lesser effect, and you're left in a difficult situation (your position changes). If you fail both, things go really badly for you, and something unexpected happens against you.<br/><br/>Option B: You name what special thing you want to get (a battle maneuver), and the GM names something really bad which could go against you. If you succeed, you get the thing you wanted; if you fail, the GM gets the thing she wanted.<br/><br/>-"I want to jump onto the dragon's back, and stab it through the weak spot in its armour!"<br/>-"Ok, but if you miss, it will pin you to the ground with one of its legs."<br/><br/>Another idea is to simply build a "Devil's Bargain" into each roll that is made. This simply takes the form of the GM making an offer of a bad thing happening and a corresponding bonus. If the player agrees, they get to take advantage of the bonus.<br/><br/>This could work with the bargain being based on the roll (e.g. on a failure) or always happening.<br/><br/>On an attack: "You're lunging at the Orc? Ok, you can get +2 to damage by really leaning into it. But if you fail, your missed attack will carry you past the Orc, effectively switching places."<br/><br/>On a defense: "The Orc is swinging its axe at you! Do you hold your ground? Or you can choose to give way, moving back to top of the staircase and that will give [you a +4 to defend/the Orc a -4 to hit]. Do you want to?"<br/><br/>This could be interesting, and, over time, the players will start to make their own offers. It could inject some dynamism without being in any way "unfair", since it's based on an open negotiation process. (Although it could be unpredictable!)<br/><br/>It would allow the heroes to face more dangerous enemies, but only in exchange for a more dynamic/less controlled field of battle.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457792/#Comment_457792" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-02T05:31:40+00:00" title="November  2, 2016  5:31AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 2, 2016 5:31AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>How you discussed anywhere why you feel shorter rounds are a "mistake"?</blockquote>\nNot that I remember, at least not in any depth - might make a good thread topic.

By introducing the concept of a longer span of time, the "exchange", we've made a space for various things to occur at a longer time-span than a 5-second block. Instead of having to accept that a health potion is accessed and applied in 5 seconds, or having to keep track of a specific number of rounds that the operation takes, we may simply declare that it takes an entire exchange, and however much fighting the combatants get done in that time, that's one them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457793/#Comment_457793" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-02T07:07:32+00:00" title="November  2, 2016  7:07AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 2, 2016 7:18AM by Rickard.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonas, don't think up maneuvers and give them mechanics. Make up some mechanics, and use them as base for descriptions.<br/><br/>Avoid <i>descriptive mechanics</i>, like "disarming"! Let the players <i>build a bridge</i> between fiction (what happens in combat) and mechanics.<br/><br/>Here are some mechanics:<br/>\u2022 Damage<br/>\u2022 Condition: continous damage (save)<br/>\u2022 Condition: continous penalty (-2, save)<br/>\u2022 Reduce to 0 HP.<br/><br/>Let say you got one standard action: roll for to-hit, roll Damage.

I throw my opponent on the ground." - Description born from mechanics; can only be negated with mechanics.<br/>"I invoke a -2 to to-hit (condition), but fail my roll. I throw my opponent on the ground." - Just a description; can be negated with another description.<br/><br/>Note: I'm a huge fan of describing after the roll, but with this way of handling things, it can actually be better to describe before the roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457794/#Comment_457794" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-02T07:22:28+00:00" title="November  2, 2016  7:22AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 2, 2016 7:22AM by Rickard.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another example:<br/><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-VPh3n02B28U?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPh3n02B28U"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/VPh3n02B28U/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/>Opponents tried to invoke a condition that did continuous damage (or just described the attack as one).

The downside is that once you have pre-determined what matters mechanically and what doesn't, the incentive to care about the concrete events in the fiction disappears. Play will focus on the numbers and their simple, dignified interplay.<br/><br/>But then again, on the other hand formalism <i>does</i> have big advantages to it in the old school context as well: this type of game requires that a massive amount of interpretation and arbitrary decision-making is funneled through the GM's desk, with the GM querying the fiction and making even-handed referee calls on everything from the weather to the positioning of furniture. Mechanical formalisms are absolutely core to abstracting out of certain types of arbitrary judgement tar pits that would otherwise become distractions or even show-stoppers. The idea that a character becomes non-capable of combat at 0 HP is an universal D&amp;D example; instead of asking the GM to adjudicate whether a knife slipped under the rib distracts combat performance, and how much, the rules go mechanics first and merely ask us to fill in the fictional blank between "I attack him with a knife" and "he lost his last hit point and therefore became a combat casualty".<br/><br/>Due to the above observations, my mechanical ideal for this sort of D&amp;D is to design locally, and design clear concepts that abstract over the tar pits of judgement, without paving over interesting organic decision-making with the abstractions. This requires a certain adherence to a golden mean, as we have some powerfully abstract concepts (HP, XP, levels, HD, Ability scores...) around which much of the game revolves, yet we do not want these concepts to become the entirety of the game: a four-legged foe should still be more difficult to trip than a two-legged one, being prone should still matter more or less depending on what you're trying to do, and so on, for doing otherwise means that we might as well not talk about tripping at all.<br/><br/>Incidentally, it occurs to me that for Jonas's purposes it might be useful to think of verbal tactical play in terms of "tags", sort of like FATE does it: individual fighters and bouts basically have traits that justify certain GM decisions, and that become the ever-sifting "terrain" of combat. This is basically what we all do while adjudicating verbal tactical situations, I think, except we don't usually write the status tags out explicitly. Nothing prevents one from doing so, though; I could see that a group struggling with the particulars of who gets to say what (and how much authority the GM has) could really benefit a lot from a procedure where fictional facts are written out before being referenced.<br/><br/>To clarify what I mean, imagine if Jonas had that whiteboard at the beginning of combat, and he started the combat by querying who attacks where, so as to get an initial lay of the land. So he writes down the combatants grouped pairwise to show who is fighting whom, and perhaps he adds some numbers to indicate initiative or HPs or whatever, too. But then he continues writing:<br/><br/><b>Jonas:</b> "Thick shrub dots the plains here and there, so let's say that this fight over here, and this one here, actually occur in the immediate vicinity of dense bushes, just for future reference. I'll write down 'shrub' here next to the combatants to acknowledge this."<br/><b>Player:</b> "Why am I fighting next to a bush, Jonas? Are you trying to fuck me over, Jonas?"<br/><b>Jonas:</b> "Why no, I just rolled 1/3 for each melee to find out - I don't have a map or any particular idea of where the bushes are, I just know that there are some. If you don't want the bush, we can just put it somewhere else, I don't really care. It just occurred to me that this fight could stand to have some varied terrain."<br/><br/>Now, what I'm trying to explain here is that what Jonas did here was not distributing bonuses or penalties to the combatants - instead, he's merely distributing environmental factors, and it still remains to be seen whether these factors come to matter at all; the shrub could be mere color, or the fighters might come to utilize it in some way that matters for the fight.<br/><br/>However, the key achievement Jonas managed here by inputting the bushes on his whiteboard was that he got the players to accept that there are, indeed, bushes on the battlefield, and as the skirmish moves about on the plains, certain combatants might move away or towards some bushes. He'll probably have no trouble occasionally removing or adding the "bush" tag from individual fighters once the initial concept has been accepted.<br/><br/>Once the players have accepted the idea that we're keeping track of who's near a bush and who's not, it is now entirely objective to say that fighters who are near a bush can e.g. jump into the bush to try to avoid their foes, or they could try to push their opponent into the bush so as to trip and entangle them. I mean, it says clearly on the whiteboard that there's a bush there, right? The bush has become a formalistic hook for rules to grab onto. Furthermore, fighters can now also try to insert of remove the "bush" tag from themselves and others by using footwork as part of their combat activities.<br/><br/>Again, this doesn't differ in any way from what we normally do, except that we're writing things down: when I run a fight like this on the plain it's simply a continuous stream of patter as I describe the battleground, "player A's engaging an orc on the left flank, they've got some pretty big and tangly desert shrubs over there, too..." By picking that patter apart and writing it down on the whiteboard the GM emphasizes that he's not talking just to warm himself up, what he describes <em>is</em> the battlefield. I could well see how a group with authority issues might benefit from this sort of technique.<br/><br/>I could see how this sort of thing might become slightly cumbersome in the long run due to the expectation that the GM knows in advance which fictional details he might wish to elevate into "tags" on the whiteboard, but perhaps that's more of a minor issue. If the major problem of not being able to have fictional positioning without miniatures (which isn't really fictional positioning at all) is solved first, then the rest is just fine-tuning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457803/#Comment_457803" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-02T17:50:35+00:00" title="November  2, 2016  5:50PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 2, 2016 5:50PM by Paul_T.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good discussion, Eero.<br/><br/>My very first post in this thread was getting at your "bush" technique, as well.

Make up some mechanics, and use them as base for descriptions.<br/><br/>Avoid <i>descriptive mechanics</i>, like "disarming"! Let the players <i>build a bridge</i> between fiction (what happens in combat) and mechanics.</blockquote>\nI don't want to rip out the existing rules of Whitehack. All characters have access to the following special combat options: Charge, Fight defensively/offensively, Grapple, Trick (Push, Feint, Disarm, Trip), Protect, Press. The Strong class have access to other formalized options.<br/><br/>The section on special combat options begins: "The Referee makes rulings over whatever whatever the players want their characters to do, but a few formalized options are suggested below", followed by the options I listed above and their effects. The text is clear that these are only suggestions, and I can of course both remove and add options both beforehand and mid-combat based on what's going on.<br/><br/>You make a good distinction between pure color narration that can be negated by other narration and the use of a formalized rule that has to be countered by a successful save, failed attack, or other result. Since it's easy fore me as referee in the heat of battle to forget about color narration, especially since it carries no "weight", I'd like to add a small rule or two to force me and the players to make a decision apart from "I attack". Or I'd like to get the color narration to carry more weight, which is why I asked how other groups avoids the back-and-forth of "I attack, miss, move on".<br/><br/>One such option is to always pair an attack roll with a secondary effect, for example pushing the opponent, tripping them, or disarming them, but you see how that is in conflict with the formalized options! How is a color narrated disarm different from a mechanically enforced one? If you use the formalized option you have to exchange your normal damage to achieve the effect, but if I add it as part of standard narration why would you ever pick the formalized option?<br/><br/>I know that you said "throw out the system and build a new from scratch", but I really want to play by the book as far as possible and add small tweaks here and there. These tweaks can be a new mechanical rule, or a new way of addressing the fiction. I don't want to come across as if I don't appreciate your input, and I ensure you that it has given me a lot to think about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457836/#Comment_457836" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-03T20:59:41+00:00" title="November  3, 2016  8:59PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me the notion of adding side-effects to attack rolls on a good roll has been just about perfect - characters get to "stunt" when their to-hit roll surpasses the target AC by more than 5, 10 or 15 points, and the stunts get to be bigger at each tier. This achieves much: combat becomes more dynamic as characters do more varied things than just hitting each other; higher level characters are actually more effective due to higher to-hit bonuses accruing more stunts; many traditional D&amp;D combat maneuver ideas like "mighty blows" and "cleaves" and so on are simplified greatly, as are situational combat tricks like knocking an enemy into fire or webbing, as all are handed via a general stunting system; players are encouraged to pay attention to the fiction and use the details to their advantage, as the fictive context determines what sorts of stunts you can try in each situation; I get all that without complicating the game, as the stunts system recedes elegantly out of the way when and where we don't want to pay attention to the detail.<br/><br/>Combat maneuvers in lieu of attacking are generally a bad idea, as instead of supplementing the hit point economy such additions to the system steal attention away. They are also difficult to balance, as either hitting to damage is still better than doing the combat trick, or it's not, in which case hit point damage falls to the wayside in favour of wrestling or whatever. (Worst thing: the more HP an enemy has, the more useful a non-HP combat effect is, which means that alternative attacks are difficult to balance over the entire level range.) For these reasons I greatly favour the notion that hit point damage <i>is</i> an abstract representation of various sorts of combat maneuvering, supplemented by the occasional specific highlight in the form of stunts or whatnot. You can't choose to not cause HP damage so as to be more effective in some other way in combat, as causing HP damage is already a representation of you being effective.<br/><br/>An alternative approach to stunting in this sense could be to simply say that each HP of damage implies a certain amount of tactical gerrymandering occurring. You could have a simple table of effects as a guideline so that disarming a single-handed weapon may happen when you cause 3 HP of damage, tripping an unready opponent for 1 HP, and so on. This isn't buying an effect instead of HP damage, but on top of it, like a poisonous snake's poison comes on top of the HP damage. It's basically the same as my system that plays off the to-hit roll, but might work better for some mechanical contexts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457837/#Comment_457837" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-03T21:04:25+00:00" title="November  3, 2016  9:04PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2016 9:05PM by Jonas Ferry.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><b>Jonas:</b> "Why no, I just rolled 1/3 for each melee to find out - I don't have a map or any particular idea of where the bushes are, I just know that there are some.

It just occurred to me that this fight could stand to have some varied terrain."</blockquote>\nGreat stuff, Eero, but here I did a double take. Taking back or changing the landscape is something I have a hard time doing as a referee. It's one thing if I manage to say something that contradicts something already established, like if the fight takes place in a field of lava and I say "Over there is a small bush" and the players say "Really? Is it burning?", I might go back and say, "Yeah, right. OK, it's a small rock that..." But if we're at the plains and I place a bush somewhere, I don't want to move it just because a player feels they will be disadvantaged by this bush. I'd rather move their character in that case, if they say that their character would never get that close to a bush if they could avoid it. I like to set the scene ("Here's what you have to work with") to provide tactical decisions for the players. I'm not saying this is the correct way of handling things, just that it's my default preference.<br/><br/>There's usually some confusion at the start of a fight if we're moving from the mind to the grid, but usually not overly problematic. Everyone has to orient themselves to figure out exactly where they are, where the monsters are, how far they are from each other, what the landscape is like, and so on. But when a player says "Are there no trees here, I'd like to hide behind a tree?", it feels like cheating to place a strategic tree for them to hide behind and surprise the monsters. It's like moving your pieces around in Ludo to create a more favorable situation for yourself before you roll; that's breaking the rules of the game.<br/><br/>I'm still only explaining the way I feel, not saying this is correct way to do things. I'm very attracted to rule sets that empower players to add fictional details as part of narration as well. I haven't played, but have read about, Feng Shui and how players add meat cleavers and other things that they need and it sounds super cool. I've played in many games like that and I don't want to sound like player-empowerment is something foreign to me. But it moves the challenge from one thing to something else. Consider the miniature wargamers where one side says "You know, it would be really convenient for my troops if there's a tree here. Is it OK if I place one?" No, it's not OK, since it wasn't part of what we agreed on when the fight started!<br/><br/>The obvious questions is then of course: When does the fight start? The players must be allowed to ask questions to clarify the situation, and they must be allowed to ask for convenient trees. I guess I'll just have to keep saying no if it doesn't fit with my vision. Or I'll take the advice from a post on another forum that urged referees to be generous and start saying yes. I recently watched "Yes Man" on Netflix, and as an experiment I could say yes to everything the players ask for a session even if it means tipping the start of the fight in their favor. It may be a lot more fun for all involved, me included.\n<blockquote>However, the key achievement Jonas managed here by inputting the bushes on his whiteboard was that he got the players to accept that there are, indeed, bushes on the battlefield, and as the skirmish moves about on the plains, certain combatants might move away or towards some bushes.

Each character has three actions per round: attack, move, and a minor action. Actions can be traded to the right, so you can trade your attack action for another move action, and so on. An unencumbered human moves (this is house rule stuff and not from Whitehack) 6 squares (9 meters) per move action. Wearing armor or a backpack lowers your movement.<br/><br/>Combine the action economy with the special combat options I described in the reply to Richard and you have the moving parts in this part of the system. Even if a PC and a monster fight next to a bush I only see it come into action if someone uses a Trick/Push action to push the other into the bush (which could make it harder to save against or it could make it harder next round to fight from the bush) or a Trick/Disarm action that flings their weapon into the bush (making it harder to retrieve). But the problem is that we'll never reach those options, because both sides will say "I attack" and roll to hit! It's almost always better to disable the opponent by lowering their HP to 0 instead of forgoing damage to disarm them or push them. You still need to kill them next round, so why wait?!<br/><br/>This might be a problem with the detailed focus of Whitehack combat options or that the trade-off to use a special option is rarely worth it. All combat options are based on "take this penalty now or later to get this bonus", and perhaps they are not viable enough compared to just attacking.

Is there something in the rules or something that you do at the table that makes this a non-issue?<br/><br/>I think it's not an uncommon problem to have in D&amp;D and clones (trading static attacks), so I'm still curious how other people handle it. We can focus on Whitehack as that's what we play, and it would be interesting to see if it's different enough from say B/X to make it more static, but I don't think this is a problem unique to Whitehack. Well, perhaps it is.<br/><br/>Paul, you asked about our online game, and I enjoyed the combat there a lot. One thing I like was that we seamlessly moved from normal flow to combat, since combat is so mechanically simple in B/X you can always throw out an attack roll and see what happens. Another thing that made it seamless was that with weak PC; as you said before on low-level play, it felt very dangerous to just enter the dungeon, even before fighting. Fighting felt a lot more fluid, with monsters attack and retreating... which makes me think of something...<br/><br/>Whitehack says: "To disengage in combat, you must move backwards at a careful pace, still facing the opponents, or you will give away free attacks." I've interpreted this as "careful pace" meaning half pace and keeping guard means you spend your attack action on this. This means when you disengage you waste your attack action and move three squares backwards, unless you're encumbered then it's less. Otherwise you're glued to your opponent.<br/><br/>If you move as part of the attack, you need to move both yourself and the opponent because neither of you can disengage (I'm talking in the general sense here, not Whitehack specific), which means some strange agreement must take place. It's like a dance where you have to stay together, so what happens if the attacker wants to move right and the defender left? Is the default that the attacker chooses where to move the defender? In Whitehack, that conflicts with the Trick/Push option ("Push the opponent five feet backwards or diagonally backwards, and follow into her former space if you like"). Also, the Strong class has an option to push an opponent ten feet after a successful attack, and if all classes can do this, one of their options is overshadowed.<br/><br/>On the grid I introduced the rule that the defender chooses how they move and the attacker has to follow, unless they attack defensively (where the defender gets a free disengage since the attacker doesn't follow their movement). I can keep this when we move to the mind, as long as I remember to do it. With the miniatures it was easy to always move them as part of the attack.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's these codified movement stuff in Whitehack that trips me up? Moving characters around willy-nilly based on narration only invalidates the usefulness of these rules, if you always get them, or even better versions, for free.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457842/#Comment_457842" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-03T22:43:43+00:00" title="November  3, 2016 10:43PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just checked B/X.

If you don't want the bush, we can just put it somewhere else, I don't really care. It just occurred to me that this fight could stand to have some varied terrain."</blockquote>\nGreat stuff, Eero, but here I did a double take. Taking back or changing the landscape is something I have a hard time doing as a referee.</blockquote>\nI understand what you mean. I did not intend the example to show the hypothetical Jonas allowing players to revise the environment for their advantage, though; rather, I was attempting to show him being transparent about his own motivations as the GM. You see, in that situation he doesn't really have any personal stakes in where the bushes are situated: he just wants some bushes on the battlefield. As long as he gets the bushes, and they get situated reasonably even-handedly (so as to not break verisimilitude by having them in strangely convenient positions for player purposes), the Jonas is happy.<br/><br/>Whether a player should have a say in where the bushes are very easily goes into the realm of imponderables: where was the party camped before the enemy attacked? Did the character jump towards that bush or away from it as he scrambled to his feet? How about the other characters? How dense are the bushes around here, exactly? These are all probably matters that were never determined in any detail in advance, which is why the hypothetical Jonas just rolled some dice to randomize the bush quotient for each individual character/bout occurring in the fictional space.<br/><br/>However, a player might have their own impression on this; while the Jonas is agnostic about the bushes, and doesn't even consider them an advantage or hindrance to any particular combatant, a given player might have other opinions. Maybe their character is bush-o-phobic, or maybe they have a special attack move they can only do when sitting in a bush. Whatever the reason, they might want to particularly have a bush or not have a bush as part of their personal combat experience. I do not find it unreasonable for Jonas to negotiate on this point, as there <i>are</i> imponderables involved in the initial placement of the characters in the tactical space: did your character set up their blankets right next to a bush, so as to have one at hand when trouble beckons? Was the first thing they did in the very first seconds of the fight to take a few leaping strides away from everybody and everything, so as to maximize their room to maneuver? Perhaps, and the hypothetical Jonas doesn't really have a horse in the race, so why not listen to the player's opinions on the matter.<br/><br/>But, of course the Jonas does not subscribe to the idea that players can just place terrain elements to their favour - this isn't a god-game, after all. As a compromise, he'll probably come up with something like "OK, everybody who is particularly unhappy with their initial bush quotient, as randomized by me just now, roll a 50/50 - you get a 50% chance to have terrain more to your liking at your immediate vicinity at the start of the fight." This approach satisfied both creative priorities: the player characters may, indeed, have some limited control over where they are fighting (which makes sense - unlike the players, the characters live in their world every second of their life, so if they find themselves sitting in a bush at the start of a fight, that may well be because they wanted to be there, even if nobody thought to discuss it in advance), but it's not some sort of a subjective right that the players have to control the combat environment. If the PCs are particularly surprised, maybe it's not 50%, maybe it's just 20% chance to get your own favoured terrain instead of whatever the GM happened to assign.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's a minor point - I think we understand the gist of what I wrote about getting players to accept verbal tactical environment by codifying it a bit and writing it down. Maybe hypothetical Jonas, if he knows that his players are absolutely incapable of being even-handed, never even hints at the possibility of them having a say in the terrain issue. Whatever works for the group.\n<blockquote>This solves the problem of establishing what's where in the fictional space, but it doesn't solve how to use this bush as part of the fight.</blockquote>\nI see what you're getting at. It's an interesting conundrum, and one that I feel that I'm familiar with. Many of the features of Basic-like D&amp;D rules that you mention are old foemen of mine. We're also satisfyingly deep into the guts of what actually happens in the D&amp;D combat game - much more deep than usual rules treatments go.<br/><br/>I wrote earlier a bit about some of my own issues with the Basic D&amp;D set-up: short rounds are difficult because of how they chop up natural flow of action into difficultly managed snapshots (as opposed to longer rounds, which resolve combat in naturally occurring bouts instead of requiring a kind of a still-life approach), while special combat options are deeply questionable on an outright mechanical level. Both can be made to work, but I frankly do not hold many of the available rules texts in very high regard in this matter. I haven't read Whitehack myself, but it sounds like it has the same Basic issues that have driven me up the wall in the past <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>(Because this is the Internet, I feel the need to say that I generally favour Basic D&amp;D over the AD&amp;D flavour of the game. Me listing pet gripes about Basic is not a hidden recommendation for some other game chassis, it's just me being critical of some more difficult aspects of the mechanical framework.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457851/#Comment_457851" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-04T07:58:08+00:00" title="November  4, 2016  7:58AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>But anyway, let's say that we're happy with the assignment of terrain, and adept at describing it to the players and keeping track of the various possibilities. How, exactly, does a D&amp;D combat get from here to a varied and dynamic style that abhors "I hit" action declarations? My answer is clearly that all sorts of combat maneuvering should be applied <i>on top of</i> the routine of HP-exhausting attack work. This is exactly what almost all D&amp;D rules frameworks already do regarding movement: they allow characters to both move and attack during the same turn. (If anything, many texts are much too liberal about allowing movement under melee conditions.) I think that the secret to dynamic combats is in accepting that not only movement, but also all sorts of other things occur during combat, all without interrupting the basic beat of attacks shaving off HPs.<br/><br/>Why is it paramount to keep those attack routines moving: the HP attrition is the central way for a combat to end, so it forms the fundamental pacing device for combat. We <i>want</i> that average of 50% hits for 1d6 damage each to occur reliably each combat round so that combats drive inexorably towards their end. Holding onto this basic principle ensures that the D&amp;D combat keeps doing the single thing it does best: low-level combats are quick and brutal affairs, while higher level combat scales into a lengthy, cinematic movie choreography. This part of the game requires no changes, the math is just fine as long as we don't introduce the notion that characters should spend most of their time on status effect attacks instead of causing HP attrition. 3rd edition D&amp;D, as we know, breaks down in this specific way: because the game includes a massive number of attack-like status impositions (a fancy way of saying "save or die spells rule the roost") that are much more effective than HP damage could ever hope to be, the conflict system revolving around the hit point currency loses its meaning, and the game becomes mathematically ungovernable at higher levels.<br/><br/>I suggested a few basic ideas for how maneuver play can be hooked into the basic to-hit or damage rolls, but let's look at it from a few more angles yet:<br/><b>*</b> Missed rolls, "whiffs", do not do anything in D&amp;D combat. This is a good thing because turns are short and the static beats are a chance for the opposition to seize initiative. There's no particular reason for secondary combat effects to trigger on misses as well as hits.<br/><b>*</b> Every action causes potential changes in the combat environment, but not all changes are equal: it is generally agreed that a character can opt to go on the defensive or join a combat without a successful dice roll, while pushing, disarming or tripping an opponent, even if possible in the given rules treatment at all, is not usually a mere matter of declaration.<br/><br/>What would the bare minimum treatment of combat maneuver rules look like? Assuming short rounds and a naive initiative scheme (basically round-robin, the way simplest D&amp;D treatments work), I think that it's best if a player may (voluntarily) describe their attack in tactical terms, and if the attack roll succeeds by a specific margin, they get their hoped-for tactical result on top of HP damage. For example:<br/><b>Tripping:</b> characterize your attack as attempting to over-run or literally trip your foe. If you hit AC+2, the opponent falls down, but your attack causes 1 less damage.<br/><b>Disarming:</b> characterize your attack as a precise strike at your opponent's weapon, attempting to loosen their grip. If you hit AC+4, the opponent drops their weapon, but your attack causes 1 less damage.<br/><b>Forcing space:</b> characterize your attack as driving your opponent back. If you hit AC+0, the opponent is forced back by the attack. Otherwise they stand their ground.<br/><b>Shield pin:</b> characterize your attack as pinning an opponent with your shield (against a wall or the ground or whatnot). If you hit AC+2, the opponent is pinned, but your attack causes 1 less damage. (Being pinned is a minor penalty for both attack and defense, as long as it lasts.)<br/><b>Softening up:</b> characterize your attack as a series of furious feints intended to drive a slower opponent to distraction and exhaustion. You cause minimum damage on a hit, but hitting AC-2 suffices.<br/><b>Defensive fighting:</b> characterize your attack as taking opportunities against an aggressive opponent, while being careful and falling back under their assault. You lose ground and only cause half damage on a hit, but if you hit AC-2 you gain +4 to your own AC for the round against this opponent.<br/><br/>Note that if you hit AC, but do not reach the elevated target number, you still got a normal successful attack in terms of HP damage, it just didn't achieve your intended tactical effect. Also note that it is simple to set target numbers here: just pick a number that reflects the fictional difficulty of the suggested maneuver, with perhaps a bit of an eye towards supposed game balance. I also included the idea that successful maneuvers might cause a bit less damage in some cases; you could run with that, or drop it and go with full damage all the time for even more streamlining. I intend this system to be used improvisationally, so while you might keep track of popular maneuvers and how they've been adjudicated in the past, it's thoroughly legit to make a ruling on the spot for a situation that hasn't come up before; players should have a subjective right to make up sensible combat maneuvers on the spot, rather than having to reference a rule book to pick from a narrow set of predetermined options.<br/><br/>This set-up is simpler than my earlier suggestions because it relies on a traditional lumped action declaration: the whole action is described in advance of the roll. It is superior to traditional alternative attack maneuvers because it is thoroughly situationally optional, and it encourages tactical acumen without being particularly overpowering. It is still OK for low-performing players to just go "I hit it with the sharp thing" seven times in a row, but because it is strictly better to describe your attack in terms of tactical achievement, players are encouraged to pay attention to not only who they attack, but also how they attack.<br/><br/>Once you have something like this at hand, every conventional detail of the battlefield becomes a potential source of a clever in-combat stunt: if there's a wall, you can limit your opponent's footwork to gain some situational bonuses; if there's dust, you can throw it in their eyes once they've tripped you; if there's furniture, you can move around it to control distance for defensive purposes. Because doing this costs you nothing in terms of "I hit it with the sharp thing", while potentially having lots of effective consequences (anything ranging from minor circumstance modifiers to enemies outright missing combat rounds or even dying due to circumstantial hijinks), players will be naturally trained into attentive, active combat choreographers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457854/#Comment_457854" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-04T16:22:08+00:00" title="November  4, 2016  4:22PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (You'll note that my initiative rules, above, were birthed from precisely the conundrum Eero outlines above: who gets to say whether the PC is next to the bush or not?

For example, we use the magic system from Drakar och Demoner (1985), another system. We could have a generalized spell called "Decrease HP" and let the player describe what it looks like, but instead we have Lightning Bolt and Fire Ball that both decrease HP and have slightly different other effects. This descriptive nature is not something I want to change. The disarm option is clearly labeled as a suggestion, and not part of an exhaustive list of options the players must choose from. My problem is that these options are not used at all, and the group falls back to "I attack".<br/><br/>There is of course weight in narration in the sense that it matters if the player place the PC in the doorway or hides behind the door. In the former case they can block entry, in the latter they can perform a surprise attack. What I'm talking about is the very focused action of attacking someone with your weapon. We can describe in more detail whether the PC stabs someone, slices them, hits their head, punches their stomach, but at the end of the day we end up with "You do 1d6+1 damage, moving on". The narration doesn't matter in  the sense that it limits or enables new possibilities next round. If the monster has HP left, they'll do a basic attack next round and if the PC has HP left they will do a... and so on. I want to break this cycle and change things up from round to round.\n<blockquote><br/>How, exactly, does a D&amp;D combat get from here to a varied and dynamic style that abhors "I hit" action declarations?

You just gave me something very specific to change as my group moves forward. Having to trade damage for a special effect like disarming is too expensive, and it breaks the basic beat of attacks shaving off HP, as you call it. A naive approach would be to add this special effect as a bonus after an extra successful attack after the fact, but this would be a mistake. I like your suggestion to instead use it as a carrot, since it would encourage more varied combats since the basic attack is still used as a fallback. I like the idea of -1 HP on a successful special attack, but I wonder if even this will dissuade the players and me from using them. I'll test that first, and if basic attacks are still only used, I'll remove the damage modification. I also don't want to make these options overpowered so that every last attack is an attempt to trip or disarm people, because then *that* risks becoming repetitive. <br/><br/>One detail in Whitehack is that when using the trick option (push, disarm, or trip) the opponent gets to save to avoid the consequences, so even if you succeed there's the risk that still nothing happens. This suggests that performing these options doesn't have to be super difficult, since it can be negated by the monster anyway.<br/><br/>I also like the list of suggestions of other options, like throwing dust in the face of the opponent, or flipping a table in front of the opponent, or whatever. I will probably assemble a list of my own and prepare some status effects, -2 on the next roll or whatever, only because it will help me in the heat of battle.<br/><br/>One great limitation of our current use of the system is that the players and me almost always start with looking at the action economy (attack, move, minor) when it's our turn and fill the slots with things to do, rather than start with stating what we want to do or achieve. This naturally leads to basic attacks as the easiest option, instead of just saying "You know, I grab a handful of dust and throw it in his face!" without knowing what mechanical benefit (if any) this will give. By making most of these minor actions (if they are not part of the attack like disarming or movement like stepping behind a piece of furniture) they can be performed in addition to the attack, instead of having to do it instead of attacking.<br/><br/>As usual, this is not all on the players. I have to start having the monsters do this, which the players might think are some new unfair monster rules until they realize these options are available to them as well. I'll tell them they are available and how the trick option has been tweaked at the start of the session, of course, but I think it's only when they've been dusted by a monster that they will want to get back at them.<br/><br/>Another neat idea is that if the monster pushes the PC so that they have their back to a wall, this gives the monster combat advantage next round (since the PC has no room to maneuver; this is part of my defensive movement hack). Luckily the PC gets to act before the monster's next turn, and will be highly encouraged to push back to get out of this situation! Tripping someone also gives combat advantage next round as per Whitehack, and if you can do this without any real risk to yourself (no wasting all damage this round for +2 HP next round; that's usually a very bad deal) it will be used more.<br/><br/>Using a special option must give you a clear advantage this round or next. Actually, this speaks against using the -1 HP option, because why trade -1 HP this round for +2 HP next round, that's only +1 HP in total. On the other hand, you also have +2 to hit next round, and there's no other drawback to using this, so I'll see if I keep the -1 or not. In one sense it's a very small detail, but on the other hand this is exactly the kind of laser-focused mechanical stuff that we weigh at the table.\n<blockquote>(You'll note that my initiative rules, above, were birthed from precisely the conundrum Eero outlines above: who gets to say whether the PC is next to the bush or not? I've been using the initiative roll to determine this - at least for any details that haven't already been established.)</blockquote>\nAt first I thought "We're not talking about who stands where, we haven't even reached that stage. The problem is painting the scenery!", but you're correct, using initiative as a way of placing the characters is an interesting and useful idea. We usually handle all that before rolling initiative, but we could surely roll initiative before establishing exactly where everyone is. Especially when playing in the mind instead of on the grid, it's very convenient to only know roughly where everyone is, and go into more detail at their initiative. "OK, your turn! You're by the door, right?" "Yes, I was hiding next to the door prepared to attack, but now I rush over to..."<br/><br/>I'm happy to keep discussing this if anyone has any more thoughts or if you think I've missed something you said, but now I have gotten what I wanted from the thread. I'll figure out the exact details, but I'll add something like Eero's suggestion on special combat options *in addition* to the regular attack and I'll tweak the Trick option to -1 HP instead of removing all damage.<br/><br/>Thanks, all!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457857/#Comment_457857" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-04T20:48:58+00:00" title="November  4, 2016  8:48PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't want to change the descriptive parts of the game. For example, we use the magic system from Drakar och Demoner (1985), another system. We could have a generalized spell called "Decrease HP" and let the player describe what it looks like, but instead we have Lightning Bolt and Fire Ball that both decrease HP and have slightly different other effects.</blockquote>\nYeah, but Drakar och demoner is pretty lousy when it comes to make the players describe, and Whitehack is probably a result of that (and OSR games of course), given that the author is Swedish.\n<blockquote>There is of course weight in narration in the sense that it matters if the player place the PC in the doorway or hides behind the door.</blockquote>\nYou can achieve weight in narration purely by <i>fictional positioning</i>. If you're laying down, how can you fight? If you are thrown out a window, how can you get back to attack?<br/><br/>You don't need to dress that up in mechanics.<br/><br/>The thing is, descriptive mechanics like Fireball and Lightning bolt, and even sword, are making the players passive. Instead of having to come up with a description, they can attack with the sword or spell, and you instantly understand what happens. That's why you get those "I attack" descriptions. If you remove the descriptive mechanic, you automatically challenge them to describe. "OK, so you did 1d6 in damage. How?!"<br/><br/>Imagine having AC be "Roll backwards to dodge". Would the players try to describe that, or will they just say "I dodge" because the context is already given to them freely?<br/><br/>Another thing that adds to it is that you can, as a game master, put them in tricky situations that they can describe their way out of. That's another way to challenge them. I always have a mantra to put the players in tricky situations. Sometimes I even write down stuff that can happen on a place.<br/><br/>Anyway, now I feel like I'm repeating myself so I will leave it at that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458067/#Comment_458067" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-13T20:47:21+00:00" title="November 13, 2016  8:47PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a big breakthrough when I stopped trying to adjudicate +s on the to-hit roll for \u201ci seize the high ground\u201d entirely, because we already have a word for \u201ccombat advantage\u201d in the game, which in odnd specifically is left incredibly vague and totally ready to describe these things: initiative.<br/><br/>Roll surprise, let the winner (if there is one) define the topography. If no winner, whoever is more mobile or more capable with missiles is going to get to make a constrained choice instead. For us, the first round is determined by whoever's weapons reach farther, over and above formations, but beyond that, we only roll initiative when there is truly a mel\xe9e\u2014a messy back-and-forth with no real tactical advantage. If you are a footsoldier fighting a mounted knight, the knight goes first\u2014unless you have a pike. If the monster can fly and you don't you go last.

We spent half the session creating new characters, a big deal because we've played with some of the previous PCs every other week for more than two and a half a years.<br/><br/>One of the players used a class ability from the Fortunate class to introduce a friendly NPC, and the rest of the session the NPC gave them the background of the adventure. This was nice, because the Drakar och Demoner adventures we use have a lot of backstory that the players have no chance of finding out. I'm going to have to use the Dogs in the Vineyard approach and have all NPCs spill everything they know, and even then there's neat stuff that only orc nr 3 might know.<br/><br/>I've always had a document for our house rules, and now I've separated it into <a href="http://jonasferry.com/ferryhack.htm" rel="nofollow">Ferryhack</a> (current rules) and <a href="http://jonasferry.com/grid.htm" rel="nofollow">Grid</a> (old cleaned-out rules). The whole point of that document is to list where we go above and beyond Whitehack, so don't read it as default Whitehack rules.<br/><br/>The funny thing is that Eero's turning-point post for me was distilled down to:<br/><br/><a href="http://jonasferry.com/ferryhack.htm#SPECIALCOMBATOPTION" rel="nofollow">SPECIAL COMBAT OPTION</a>\n<blockquote>When using a special combat option, instead of forsaking all damage, subtract 1 from damage.</blockquote>\nI especially look forward to grappling. A player suggested that we increase the damage from unarmed combat from Whitehack's default 1 hp. Static damage is boring, so we now use 1d2 instead. This means that successfully grappling someone (a special combat option) does 1 hp damage, and next round you can keep hurting them with 1d2 hp by punching or choking them. The target needs to win a STR contest to break free. I think I'll pit the next strong monster on the PCs trying to grapple them, as it's not something that has been used before. Before, grappling did no damage and then you'd only do 1 hp per round. <br/><br/>I also added a new entry on combat advantage, heavily inspired by Circle of Hands, to introduce some Referee rulings into combat:<br/><br/><a href="http://jonasferry.com/ferryhack.htm#COMBATADVANTAGE" rel="nofollow">COMBAT ADVANTAGE</a>\n<blockquote>One side in melee always has combat advantage. It is assigned by the Referee who considers, somewhat in order of importance:<br/><br/>1. What just happened? (shield bash, unexpected arrow, aggressive attack ...)<br/>2. Number of combatants on each side. (count only current melee)<br/>3. Terrain and positioning. (standing, lying, surprise, dark vision ...)<br/>4. Weapons used. (longer is usually better, but not in close quarters)<br/>5. Who started it? (all else being equal, engaging side gets advantage)<br/><br/>The Referee picks the single most deciding factor in this instant to determine combat advantage, and does not add and subtract every individual source of advantage. Combat advantage can shift from one side to the other mutiple times during combat based on what happens.<br/><br/>It is impossible for a single character to both gain combat advantage and use it in the same combat round. Only combat advantage assigned to the character's side at the start of their round can be used. Through their actions, the character may gain combat advantage for someone else with lower initiative to use on the same side in the same round.</blockquote>\nHaving guaranteed combat advantage on either side will make combat more deadly (a good thing above level 1), and we've also increased weapon damage across the board. A sword used to do 1d6+1 and now does 1d8 damage. A two-handed sword did 1d6+2 and now 1d10. It's because the players felt that damage was too close to each other, with no real difference between weapons. We'll see if all these changes make combat really deadly. In addition to players always having the option to avoid combat, PCs in Whitehack have a lot of options that give them an edge, like special class abilities and CON saves to avoid damage, so I don't think deadlier combat is a bad thing.<br/><br/>We'll see if there's combat in the session next week.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458118/#Comment_458118" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-16T06:03:37+00:00" title="November 16, 2016  6:03AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (You didn't increase weapon damage average, you just increased its variance, increased its max, and decreased its min.

The first session was in December a couple of weeks before Christmas. Before the session, I sent an email to the group where I included long quotes from this thread (and a link to the full thread), but when the PCs fought a pack of hyenas, I still reverted to the old "the hyena attacks *rolls dice*" mode. I set up the scene better, with descriptions of how the PCs were fighting in relation to the fire and their pack animals, but in the heat of battle I couldn't think of cool maneuvers for the hyenas. After the session, when I was on my own, of course I thought that they could've jumped on top of a PC to knock them to the ground, and as I'm writing this I realize that they could've bit a PC in the leg to hold them in place.<br/><br/>The next session was a couple of weeks ago in January: No combat! Next session will probably be more combat heavy with humanoid opponents.<br/><br/>The thing is, the group of players never call me out when I fall back on these lazy GM habits, so it's hard to notice as it happens. I still want to improve.<br/><br/>I think that one thing holding me back is a fear of unknown situations and how to judge them. Eero gave me a wonderful tool above with the idea that you don't have to choose between regular damage and a special effect. If you hit AC+2 or AC+4 you get both, otherwise only normal damage. What I want to do, and will tell the players before next session, is to be completely in the moment and just describe the most cinematic and coolest looking move I can think of (I'm not talking wire-fu kung fu stuff here, just imagine it's something from a fantasy movie) like pushing the shield to the side, knocking an axe in the face of the opponent while sweeping their legs from under them, without having to pause to think what kind of move this is. If they hit AC, they do damage, if they hit AC+4 the opponent is on the ground. Pushing the shield is just part of the successful attack.<br/><br/>I'm a bit unclear myself how much I want to describe before the roll and how much after. One school of thought would say that you describe intent, then roll. Another that you just say "I attack", then roll, then you describe the result based on the outcome. The latter avoids having to describe speculative future events and then roll them back, but removes the carrot that the description of the event can give you an advantage in the attack. I'll have to consider this a bit more, talk to the group, and try slightly different versions. I'm leaning towards what I said in the previous paragraph: a fully fictional description up until the result of the attack (no "I want to attack and do a trip maneuver", describe what it looks like!), a roll with AC+2 as the baseline for a special effect, and then a description of the result after the attack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459774/#Comment_459774" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-31T17:04:44+00:00" title="January 31, 2017  5:04PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2017 5:05PM by Jonas Ferry.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt; no "I want to attack and do a trip maneuver", describe what it looks like!<br/><br/>To clarify what I mean: I'm not after just describing the same thing in more flowery language.

This is in a sense roleplaying 101, so I'm happy that you're patient with me figuring this out in public.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459776/#Comment_459776" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-31T17:23:07+00:00" title="January 31, 2017  5:23PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I myself favour a golden mean between describing in advance or after the roll. Specifically - and this is with our 1-minute combat rounds - it is normal in our campaign for the combatants to declare their <i>intent</i> (what you're doing in general terms) and <i>means</i> (what technical, tactical, environment factors play into it) in advance, while saving the <i>outcome</i> (how it plays out in dynamic interaction with enemy reaction) for after the roll.<br/><br/>The above may seem like a no-brainer, but due to the way our system supports combat maneuvers as both a means and an outcome, there is actually a certain intricate logic to it that aids us greatly in supporting an intricate combat environment. Consider these examples:<br/><br/><b>Example <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a></b><br/><br/><i>The party is engaging in combat in a dark cave against ghouls. The ghouls have cut off their retreat.</i><br/><br/><b>GM:</b> Who's next in the initiative order?<br/><b>Secretary:</b> Player A, Sir.<br/><b>GM:</b> Very well. Player A; what will you do?<br/><b>A:</b> I'll bait the ghouls by dropping to my knees - actually just one knee, gripping to my sword on the ground - and begging for mercy. Just as they react, I'll spring forward, slash viciously and attempt to break in between them and on to freedom.<br/><b>GM:</b> Very good. Make your attack roll and we'll see what happens. You'll take a -2 for the lightning conditions and -2 for the fanciness of the maneuver, but it does enable you to try to break through. Speaking of which, also make a supplementary tumble check against DC 23 - 20 base, +3 for the second ghoul - as I want to see whether you manage to sucker the ghouls so as to not draw opportunity attacks.<br/><b>A:</b>  I got 24 for the attack roll and 28 for the tumble check, Sir.<br/><b>GM:</b> The attack hits, but no stunts. The tumble check indicates that your maneuver was a fine success: you surprise the ghouls, bash one in the face with the guard of your sword - roll damage, by the way - and run from them before they manage to close their ranks.<br/><b>A:</b> Do I get stunts on the tumble check, Sir?<br/><b>GM:</b> No, because it was not an Action, merely a supplementary check. It was basically the thing you bought for that -2 to the attack roll, the opportunity to get through the ghouls without being massacred by their claws.<br/><b>Secretary:</b> Sir, why did you not have the ghouls make a reactive Wits save to see through the ruse?<br/><b>GM:</b> It would have been a legit choice, but too much operational overhead for what amounts to a minor combat maneuver in a combat where I sense the group wishes to advance fluidly. The tumble check gives us sufficient sense for the imponderables of the situation to proceed.<br/><b>Secretary:</b> Very good, Sir!<br/><br/><b>Example <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a></b><br/><br/><i>Same situation, except the player just happens to formulate their action declaration a little bit differently...</i><br/><br/><b>GM:</b> Who's next in the initiative order?<br/><b>Secretary:</b> Player A, Sir.<br/><b>GM:</b> Very well. Player A; what will you do?<br/><b>A:</b> I'll attack the ghouls viciously, Sir. I fight with a sword and shield.<br/><b>GM:</b> Very good. Roll for attack, remember to take -2 for the dim lightning conditions.<br/><b>A:</b>  I got a 30!<br/><b>GM:</b> The attack hits, two stunts if you want them.<br/><b>A:</b> OK, let's see. I suprise them with my aggression, shouting in their face as I drive them back. For one stunt I get through them to the other side, for the other I draw their attention to me.<br/><b>GM:</b> Both fine stunts, very well. The ghouls growl and the smartest one, Joker, accuses you of playing too rough. They're helpless to stop your swift movements, but most of them turn to pursue, intent on currying favour in Joker's eyes.<br/><b>B:</b> My turn next, I'll be sure to use the distraction.

Everything in the way I construe D&amp;D is built around enabling player communication, which is why the combat maneuver system is <i>syntactically redundant</i>: the same fictional ideas can be expressed and executed in different order and with different mechanical implementations according to need. The system is not reliant on the players knowing and "gaming" it; it is purposed from the start to also support players who focus on fictional tactics and let the GM referee them.<br/><br/><b>2)</b> The system encourages tactical gerrymandering by having multiple points that actively require the players to acknowledge and account for them: before the attack roll the players have the opportunity to describe their action in a way that garners situational bonuses or reduces penalties, or they can even construct special actions that the GM needs to make a ruling on on the spot, like in example <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>. After the roll the dice themselves talk: if you rolled well, the stunt system actively encourages you to play the good roll for all it's worth, which means giving the combat choreography more meat to its bones.<br/><br/>You can hopefully see how the system does not really engage the question of whether actions are described in advance or after the roll - either is fine! It achieves this freedom by having a solid baseline default action (roll to hit AC, deal damage on success), a rulings-making referee (who can interpret fictional events into mechanics in real time) and a consequence-system for the dice roll (the stunting) that encourages utilizing tactics for added benefits.<br/><br/>Applying this kind of thinking to your situation, I would in your stead attempt to support both before-roll and after-roll descriptions. Just, you know, be natural about it: before the roll we don't know yet how it will go, so it is more natural for the players to talk in terms of goals and means. After the roll we have a formal basis to construe success or failure, so that's a good time to talk in definite terms about what <i>does</i> happen. Before the roll it is "I want to break through to the other side of the ghouls, and here's how I do it" while after the roll it is "Clearly this round of combat went my way, let's figure out what sorts of good things happened, exactly."<br/><br/>Concretely, the rules conceit that encourages pre-roll descriptions in D&amp;D is <i>circumstance modifiers</i>: if you consistently acknowledge what the players say, and not just in a "good boy!" way, but by integrating their ideas into the mechanical tapestry, then that encourages them to be more active about it. This is <i>not</i> about rewarding good description, note, but rather good tactics. Do you give a character a +2 to an attack roll when they have an opportunity to charge to melee from farther out, giving them dangerous forward-moving momentum and aggressive initiative? Should you?<br/><br/>(Note, I specifically chose the idea of a "charge" as my example here because it has something that those Whitehack combat maneuvers do not: it is, in its traditional form, represented as an unambiguous mechanical bonus instead of a fiddly little mechanical trade-off. This is fundamentally a different thing - that charge bonus is saying that your fictional tactical choices <i>can</i> make you more powerful in combat, instead of saying that combat is a finely balanced mini-game where every choice has been carefully balanced to make it useful only after careful mechanical optimization.)<br/><br/>Similarly, the best way to encourage post-roll description is, in my experience, the "stunt system" I've described: when the players roll well, let them add in some more tactical detail to the game. I don't often characterize some rule as outright excellent, but with this one I just don't see the downside: because the players don't roll well all the time, they don't get to trip their opponents on <i>every</i> attack, and because human psychology naturally desires to use what one deserves, even the most passive player will do their utmost best to turn that initial "I hit them" into a detailed action the one time they roll a natural '20'. The idea of using tactics to improve your position just flows better for the players most of the time when they have already "earned" the right to have good tactical consequences by having already rolled the die.<br/><br/>For mechanical suggestions, how about you try these two little things on top of what you have right now:<br/><br/><b>1)</b> Whenever an attack roll hits AC+5 or better, let the player choose a "wildcard" tactical maneuver: this can override whatever they declared in advance, as long as the action still features the attack against the indicated opponent. You can justify the extraordinary privilege (in the context of your system, I mean) of getting to choose the action after the dice roll with the notion that sometimes lucky things just happen.<br/><br/><b>2)</b> Use circumstance modifiers on action declarations, and suggest them yourself to the players when situations appropriate for using them come up. Keep them small-ish for the most part, but strive for consistency, and favour things that represent real tactical advantages that characters can get from fictional positioning and massaging their action declarations in interesting and relevant ways. For starters, at least give a<br/>+1 per each additional combatant when multiple characters gang up on one;<br/>+4 when attacking from surprise;<br/>+2 on a charge;<br/>+2 for favourable armament interactions (armed vs unarmed for instance);<br/>+2 against a disarrayed or scared foe                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli" title="davidepignedoli"><img alt="davidepignedoli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli">davidepignedoli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459801/#Comment_459801" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-01T18:30:10+00:00" title="February  1, 2017  6:30PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I apologize in advance because I didn't yet read the entire thread, but only the opening post and a few replies. The opening post though inspired some thoughts...<br/>I loved the idea of an ever-changing scenario for fights, without static trading blows, and I was wondering how to maintain that without the need for a grid.<br/><br/>Actually, there is so much focus in tactics, with a grid and the houserules described by Jonas Ferry, that is hard to imagine how to maintain such weight in tactics while dropping the map/grid.<br/><br/>So I came up with some abstract zones: divide the playing characters and the enemies in rear, body and front, give each zone different prerogatives (for example you're hard to be attacked in rear, somehow protected in body, and exposed but aggressive in front), and regulate the movements between zones with simple rules (e.g. attacks in melee push you forward in the grid, a successful attack against you might push you back, etc.).<br/><br/>The tactics remain (for example, an enemy in the rear ranks targeting characters with a ranged weapon or spells must be taken out from the Front of the PCs' zone, but getting to the front means getting exposed and having to resort to multiple attacks, round by round, to advance...), while the grid disappears in favor of an abstract representation of the battle field.<br/><br/>Here is the link to a very simple draft - totally <b>un</b>-playtested!<br/>Have fun with it, if you wish, and let me know what you all think!<br/><br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/dvki519xxavts90/OSR%20combat%20zones.pdf?dl=0" rel="nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/dvki519xxavts90/OSR%20combat%20zones.pdf?dl=0</a><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459839/#Comment_459839" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-03T08:37:29+00:00" title="February  3, 2017  8:37AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Success! Or at least a partial success that we can keep improving on.<br/><br/>In yesterday's session, the PCs were ambushed in a war-torn forest by a band of four goblins with bows and swords. It's been a while since we last had combat, so we were all a bit rusty on exactly which house rules were in play at the moment. I keep a master list of house rules, but we're always trying small and large things out.<br/><br/>I introduced the rule that if you (PC or monster) roll AC+4 you get a bonus special action in addition to doing full damage. This went over very well, and was relevant in two exchanges: one where a goblin attacked a PC and one where a PC attacked a goblin. The goblin attacked a dwarf PC and in addition to doing damage tripped him, securing combat advantage for his side the next round. The second goblin in that fight stabbed the lying dwarf in the neck, almost killing him (successful save vs death roll). The PC who got a special attack killed the goblin anyway by doing high damage. I was about to suggest that he fling the body into the other goblin, but he was already describing a cleave maneuver (not part of the AC+4 rule, but a rule for the Strong class in Whitehack) and killed the other goblin anyway.<br/><br/>The only complaint from the players, and I agree, was that using only the post-roll bonus actions remove any tactical decision, shifting it into pure luck. You can't trade damage for the advantage of tripping someone, you just have to get lucky. I didn't feel that shifting the AC+4 declaration to before the roll as well would make a big difference, as it's still down to just the roll of the dice. But we have the old rule of adding a guaranteed special maneuver for -1 damage on the attack, and using this together with AC+4 will give both a tactical choice and surprise bonuses from time to time.<br/><br/>I picked AC+4 instead of +5 because all other modifiers are +2 or +4, so I like to avoid a special case. We'll see if these maneuvers will be too common, but I don't think so.<br/><br/>I didn't use Eero's second suggestion of many small modifiers, instead keeping the house rule that one side always has combat advantage (+2 to hit and damage), and that this advantage can shift sides depending on what happens. You can't gain advantage and use it in the same round, but you can maneuver yourself fictionally to gain advantage this round and use it the next round. This combat advantage is huge and makes combat much more deadly. The PCs had 2 hit dice on average, bing level 2, and the two goblins hit the dwarf with 1d6+2 damage with their short swords for a total of 7+7 in a round. Hopefully this will make the players fight hard to gain combat advantage and I can try to take it back for the monsters, using the fiction to describe how and why it shifts.<br/><br/>There are other parts of combat that can be improved. I was better at describing the environment, but it still turned into only color narration and the combat could still have taken place on an open plain for the effect the forest had. I didn't allow or limit attacks, or hand out modifiers or combat advantage, depending on trees in the way or underbrush affecting movement. I think I will try to tie the environment mainly into shifting combat advantage, and that using the environment as part of the description can shift advantage to your side. This combat the goblins kept the advantage the whole fight, mainly through two critical failures from the PCs, but after the first PC death in the "new" combat system, I'm sure that the players will fight hard for combat advantage.<br/><br/>The post-roll bonus action was indeed a nice addition, and it effortlessly turned the exchange of blows into "now the dwarf is on the ground and the goblins are on top of him", which was nice. This is exactly the kind of shifts I'm looking for between rounds. With a pre-roll tactical choice, this looks like the correct path forward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459865/#Comment_459865" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-03T20:59:11+00:00" title="February  3, 2017  8:59PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is really interesting.

A combination of narrated events by the GM and questions posed of the PCs worked to develop the landscape and choreography of combat: for instance, if one character was charging towards another, a successful attack would probably mean that both of them would land further back, pushing the "line" backwards.<br/><br/>I'll have to pay greater attention to this next time I play, to see if I can distill some techniques from that.

I remember trying to come up with clever and inventive tactics for my "monsters" (within the limitations of their intelligence and organization, of course), which would really shift the battleground. But then it helps that I use a "monster generator" which determines relationships between my monsters, and tells me whether they are smart, capable of coordinating tactics, and so forth.<br/><br/>For instance, I knew that my dungeon had a large, frightening beast, and a group of weak but intelligent humanoids that this beast hunted. Additionally, I knew that the humanoids were well-organized and acted in concert, and amphibious. When the PCs were passing through an area with a deep pool connecting to a underwater tunnel, I rolled a random encounter and it came up with a "double" result - the humanoids as well as the beast.<br/><br/>It followed quite naturally that the beast was *hunting* the humanoids (why else would they be in the same place together?). However, as the humanoids retreated from the beast, they found themselves cornered when the PCs appeared from the other direction. I had them think quickly and dive into the pool, leaving the beast to charge the PCs, instead. (The beast, in comparison, was unintelligent and acting purely on instinct, so it simply continued charging ahead -  the PCs were eventually able to lure it away and escape to safety.)<br/><br/>This kind of dynamic dungeon environment naturally led to some fun combat scenarios, and the players had to be equally active and/or clever. If they simply stood in a line and "rolled to hit", they would rapidly find themselves outclassed.<br/><br/>However, elements of the system (high hit point values, easy defenses/heavy armour, etc) can all work against this kind of dynamism. I stick pretty consistently to low-level play for this reason, or rulesets which retain a feeling of danger and uncertainty. I think that in higher level D&amp;D, this would be much more challenging to achieve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459875/#Comment_459875" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-04T00:20:43+00:00" title="February  4, 2017 12:20AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game changes in higher levels, in ways that I like to embrace; it's a feature, not a bug, that combat is different then.

Most of my complex combat rules (compared to Basic D&amp;D, I mean - it's still more streamlined than most D&amp;D editions) deal with basic combat situations that are the bread and butter of low-level play.<br/><br/>As for how I embrace high level play, it is simply by accepting the mechanical premises of the game and running with them, seeing what they bring: more hit points evidently (1 hit die per level is the deal), slower level-ups (double the xp for each level), higher bonuses on rolls (e.g. +1 to hit per level for fighters) and more special abilities for everybody. It is a journey of discovery, and I try to engage it without forcing the game to follow some preconception of mine (such as an insistence that combats need to be quick and deadly because they were that a low levels).<br/><br/>If you're asking me what high level play is like and how it differs from low level play, I'll have to say that I do not know, for I have never yet reached high level play. We've only been to mid-levels a few times. For what it's worth, mid-level play differs from low level play in that lethality goes way down and adventures begin more from player character positioning and less from generic hooks. Combats tend to be more deliberate and cinematic, less random and awful. You evaluate risks more and take less of them.<br/><br/>My hypothesis is that "low level" and "high level" are sort of absolute ideals for the D&amp;D conception of combat (and action adventuring in general), and the actual game occurs in a dynamic procession between these end-points of a continuum. The abstract ideal of low level combat is a single attack roll deciding everything, while the high-level ideal is an economy of hit points that makes the variability in attack roll outcomes statistically irrelevant, leaving behind mere resource management. One of those systems should be very usable for a gritty, nihilistic game of war; the other, a carefree, romantic swashbuckling wuxia game. Neither of these absolutes is practically relevant by itself to playing D&amp;D, but in combination they form a campaign arc in which the relationship of the player character to the dangers around him slowly transforms. The interesting bit is that there is no formal transference at any point, it's all just in how the game mechanics interrelate to the world: at some point you'll just notice that hey, I'm no longer the adventurer who has to be afraid of a pit trap or a kobold's spear - I've outgrown these mundanities and become the Monkey King.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

There you will find very clearly expressed that as the characters get to higher levels, and have all those big numbers to deal with, they get to stop worrying about the stuff that was make-or-break from low levels: you don't need a torch when you have continual light cast upon your holy symbol, you don't need to worry much about encumbrance when as well as an army of henchfolk you have a bag of holding, you don't need to worry about food or tents one monster encounter per day or the dungeon walls or the ocean or death itself (as much). The spell-casters get to choose per adventure which parts of the game they don't want to deal with this week, basically.<br/><br/>Also related: the last time I revised my rules I made magic armour significantly more rare and weapons (which are 50% swords) more common to shift the numbers towards more-lethal at mid-level, and encourage bold plays. In the Swords &amp; Wizardry rules you trade out 100, 1000, and 5000 coins of treasure for a chance of an item, and normally those are evenly +1, +2, or +3\u2014I moved +1 armour into the second chart and both +2 and +3 into the third. Nobody notices because swords are cooler anyway, and tbh shields are actually cooler than suits of armour too (they stay in the old distribution).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460522/#Comment_460522" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-22T10:52:58+00:00" title="February 22, 2017 10:52AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2017 10:55AM by Jonas Ferry.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Resounding success last session! We had a fight I really liked, and that I can hold up as an example to myself in the future.<br/><br/>Before the session, I emailed two principles to the group, and at the start of the session I wrote them on the whiteboard:<br/><br/>1. In combat = free maneuvers<br/><br/>2. Setting = decide on the spot and write in chronicle<br/><br/>The second principle has nothing to do with this discussion, and was prompted because I feel like the world in the module we use was barely defined, and that we hand wave a lot of stuff instead of making a firm decision. When I did impro theater, the instructors stressed how important it is to be bold and make decisions instead of waffling, and the second principle referred to this. I included it here to say that we don't only try to improve the combat in our game.<br/><br/>So the first principle doesn't use "free maneuvers" in a technical sense. What I mean is that at the start of each combat round, before stating "I attack", we all look at the situation and the player or GM decides what the next obvious thing would be. We now have two ways of including a special effect in addition to attack damage: you either do -1 damage for a guaranteed special effect (target save negates) or you do full damage if you hit AC+4 (target save negates). The free maneuvers refers to the fact that you're free to do anything you like, and not just pick an option from a list of special maneuvers. I want to stress that Whitehack clearly says that the list of special options are codified examples and that you can do anything, so it has less to do with the game than with me and the group.<br/><br/>The specific scene had the group trying to make their way into fort by firing a grappling hook from a crossbow into a window and climbing in. The black-ops themed orc-slayer dwarf that focuses on climbing and sneaking was first through the window and found a sleeping orc in a bed. He failed his sneak roll and the orc rolled a successful perception check, but the dwarf surprised the orc and had a free attack. Here we paused for a second, and instead of just saying "I attack" the player said he would rush up to the orc, hold him down (grappling), and slit his throat with his dagger. I've adopted a suggestion from Paul to have daggers do double damage when grappling, but in this case only in the round following the successful grapple. The dwarf missed and the orc pushed himself towards the wall. Next round we paused again, and the player decided to flip the bed to trap the orc and stab him through the mattress. He chose damage-1 and succeeded, rolled 1d4 + 2 (hit bonus) - 1 = 5 and I rolled the HD 2 orc's hit points = 2. We described (the player started, and other filled in details) how he stabbed the mattress that started to turn red-black, how the blood started running out on the floor from behind the flipped bed, and so on. As a bonus the module stated that a small chest with coins was hidden under the bed, and I hoped that this reveal acted as a reinforcement that it's good to be creative.<br/><br/>As a short aside, they walked around the second floor of the fort and found a closet with a trunk propped against the wall. The dwarf player pulled it out to investigate, and promptly found the hidden door behind the trunk. They followed some stairs down into the basement, and opened a door into an unused room in the orc-held fort and found an old wooden throne with a cushion on the seat. The dwarf decided to steal the cushion and found a hidden compartment in the seat that held the part of the magical staff they came to the fort to find. They sneaked out without further combat. The black-ops dwarf was hilariously lucky in that he managed to find almost every hidden thing by accident.<br/><br/>Back to the combat: The only drawbacks I see at the moment is that I need to ask if the player wants damage-1 or AC+4 every round which slows things down, and that the special moves may turn out to be overpowered if they are used all the time. One obvious solution is to pick either damage-1 or AC+4 as the only system, but I'm not sure which one I like yet and will keep both for a couple of sessions. The benefit of AC+4 is that it acts as a post-roll bonus that can be used to improve the situation, and the benefit of damage-1 is the trade-off that forces a tactical decision before the roll.<br/><br/>One player also saw the risk of describing hypotheticals that may never happen and how this will increase the whiff factor and make the PCs look incompetent, but we agreed that it's OK to keep the initial description short and expand it if both the attack and save goes the attacker's way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460523/#Comment_460523" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-22T11:32:57+00:00" title="February 22, 2017 11:32AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like good dungeoneering to me. I suspect that the existence of a purposeful strategic overlay to the action (the purposeful sneaking plan, and a specific goal to the expedition) helps in building towards more meaningful tactical action as well. Nice to hear that you're cohering towards a toolset that works for your group!<br/><br/>Regarding the drawbacks you're pondering: I use my own equivalents of both of your described stunt mechanics, which means that we do indeed need to distinguish between them before the roll. However, in practice and over the long term it's not really that the GM needs to <i>ask</i> the player every time which they want, because the players just get used to describing their actions in terms of the fiction and the rules: if the player gives you a maneuver, then <i>obviously</i> they want to prioritize that (and thus take the -1 to damage, as per your system), and if they give you an attack description (either "I attack" or something more verbose that boils down to the same thing), then equally obviously they want to do the opportunistic thing and only make a maneuver if the dice give it to them.<br/><br/>In practice you'll want to keep asking the players for it (I prefer to formulate this as "do you want to prioritize damage or maneuver?", but you probably have your own phrasing) until one or two of them <i>really</i> get it and start using it purposefully to their advantage. At that point you can just stop asking and let the players naturally observe each other using maneuvers. It won't slow the game down anymore at that point.<br/><br/>Note that the -1 to damage that you consider a tactical tradeoff here will probably shift in value as the tactical environment of the group matures: as the players learn to utilize tactical options more fully, they will come to view that -1 to damage as a negligible price to pay for all sorts of reasonable, fiction-based opportunities to lay status effects and sow confusion. I draw attention to this because I think that it's impossible to "balance" that trade-off in any meaningful way: the most you can hope for is what you now have, a nominal +1 to damage for a character who limits themselves to a a simple "I attack".<br/><br/>In case my experience with a similar system is any indication, the real limit to using combat maneuvers is not the price paid for them (assuming that the price is generally to the low side), but rather the availability of tactical opportunity: some situations simply have more opportunity for various derring-do than others. I think that this is precisely as it should be, too: when players think up clever tactical maneuvers, it should be beneficial to use them, and when there aren't any available in the fictional situation, they shouldn't just be invented out of whole cloth. That organic variety is precisely the virtue I see in a task resolution based combat system like D&amp;D's.<br/><br/>From this perspective I think that worrying about maneuvers being used "all the time" or "not enough" is somewhat superficial: the real question is whether the rules support players in latching onto fictional details that enable clever and fun maneuvering. Once they do, the amount of maneuvering finds a natural, pleasing level that is not too much or too little by simply being whatever amount of maneuver is found appropriate by the group in a given fictional situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460537/#Comment_460537" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-22T19:26:16+00:00" title="February 22, 2017  7:26PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting thread! When my players resort to the "I attack" description I ask them back questions like "How do you attack? How do you hold your weapon and what are you aiming at?". However I don't ask that to bring a penalty to the roll, but to help me come up with the description of what will happen later. Not that their description wouldn't bring other mechanics or penalties into play or even raise the difficulty, but my goal isn't to keep fishing for those, just to help me have a mental image of what's going on.<br/><br/>Then comes the roll, which will usually inform me of the rest. I take the PbtA approach here: a high roll will include something that happen by chance and opens an opportunity for that player, for the next or even for the whole group. A hit resolves itself well per usual. <br/><br/>A miss is the perfect opportunity to depict the opponent doing something awesome. Why wait until you roll a crit as a GM or force the evil guy into finally doing something cool and evil, if you have golden chances like these? Does it make sense that a seasoned adventures could miss an attack? I feel like it's mocking the character and even the player choices by extension. Not that doing that it's part of the fun for a lot of people but there will be plenty of chances for that later, why ruin a good combat with moments of poor PC performances?<br/><br/>And finally a fumble is a perfect opportunity to spell doom for all players. On a fumble I usually narrate how something new comes to threat the whole group. A new hazard changes the terrain disposition, sign of reinforcements appear on the vicinity, the boss makes an area attack, etc. That usually feels more fair than crippling one PC, destroying their weapons and other bad stuff. Not that this can't happen if the situation calls for it, but these aren't my default options anymore.<br/><br/>There's also the monster tricks, resistances and immunities that the players don't know about yet. If those make the roll unnecessary I just jump to the description.<br/><br/>And finally, I noticed that my group doesn't read the rules even when I hand them separatedly. I made a hand-out detailing all the different actions, conditions and options they had outside their class for our 5e campaign, but it wasn't until we roleplayed an actual training combat scene that they started to get the wide range of possibilities they had in combat. <br/><br/>I had an old veteran charge them a few coppers for a single training mock battle that brought all these mechanics into play. I didn't roleplayed the guy to treat them as newbies, but instead he recognized their skills, told them they made him remember the times he was an adventurer and offered his advice. I coupled this with further explanation on how the actual mechanics went and slowly, the players started to get better ideas for their tactics.<br/><br/>Throwing them a bone from time to time also helps. I mean, just by adding a chandelier to a tavern you give them a perfect hint of a nice strategy. Whenever I describe the terrain for a battle I add some cover at random. After all those chances could also benefit their enemies too. This cover doesn't last forever. A charging large monster may move it aside easily and even pick it up and throw it at the PC. Dust may obscure visibility for a moment. Bushes may not act as cover but goblins can perfectly hide behind them for an ambush. All this makes the PCs break the line and run for cover or to get a clean attack.<br/><br/>More recently I've been checking the combat mechanics in the videogame "For Honor" and I just love how guard works. It isn't only about hitting the button in time to parry an attack (something you can't reproduce in tabletop without resorting to dice and thus, mere luck instead of strategy) it's about paying attention to your opponent's guard. They can either attack from left, right or above. their guard shows what they could try next as the attacking posture they take reveals it clearly. If you match their guard, you will have better chances of parrying their attack.<br/><br/>There's more to the game: feints, charge, breaking the opponent guard, dodge, etc. It would require a dedicated system to properly take advantage of it all as it's a different paradigm from tabletop games, but perhaps adding a couple of things from here to your usual game it could made a significative difference. Best luck and thanks for the ideas!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460543/#Comment_460543" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-22T22:53:36+00:00" title="February 22, 2017 10:53PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, yes, I'll keep everything as is for now to try it out more and I won't adress anything that doesn't manifest itself at the table. We have one successful fight, but I don't know what will happen in the next 4v4 fight or in a situation where you don't have this imbalance of positions (one sleeping) at the start of the fight. We'll see.<br/><br/>I think you're correct in finding the natural pleasing level of special maneuvers through play. I don't want a situation where everyone is "disarm, disarm, disarm" to the detriment of everything else if it turns out that maneuver gives great results cheaply, but in that case we can discuss in the group how to handle it and perhaps patch the rules.<br/><br/>The players like to talk about loopholes in the rules, but they usually don't exploit them. One example is the shield splintering rule we have, where you can avoid all damage from an incoming attack after the damage roll if you have a shield and allow it to break. One player immediately said he would bring a small wagon with shields into the dungeon, but the current PCs are all shieldless. I wouldn't mind if they exploited a rule that was clearly overpowered, but we would surely have a discussion about it if I thought it ruined the fun.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460545/#Comment_460545" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-22T23:15:07+00:00" title="February 22, 2017 11:15PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2017 11:16PM by Jonas Ferry.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WarriorMonk, thanks for all the ideas. It's a lot of stuff, so I'll have to reread it over the next couple of days to digest it and see how it relates to our game.\n<blockquote>More recently I've been checking the combat mechanics in the videogame "For Honor" and I just love how guard works. [...]<br/><br/>There's more to the game: feints, charge, breaking the opponent guard, dodge, etc.</blockquote>\nIt's funny that you mention this, because For Honor is all I've been playing lately for a couple of hours each night. This discussion started before the game was released, but I've found a lot of new inspiration there relevant to the thread. I played the open beta and bought the full game even though I almost never buy games at release, preferring to wait for the price to go down and bug patches to be applied. I'm close to a reputation 4 warlord in the game, so I've played it some.<br/><br/>I've been thinking about how you could adapt the three stances (left, right, top) where you can either block (safe) or parry (unsafe, but worth more because of followups) into OSR D&amp;D, but I don't think it works as well at the table because it's based on reaction speed and not just blind luck. <br/><br/>But one thing that's very controversial in the game, and that I will adopt for Whitehack, is environmental kills. You can pull and push people around (and the warlord does it best), and either push people into fires (victim takes continuous damage for a while) or you can push them into spikes or off ledges for an instant kill. I've almost never used this in Whitehack, no one ever pushes anyone even though one player even has it as his only special class option at the moment. Being pushed into a wall is disorienting in For Honor, which means that you can't see the direction your opponent attacks from, and this could be ported into Whitehack as combat advantage (+2 to hit and damage), a free attack, or loss of your attack. You can also headbutt people as a warlord and if they're out of stamina, they fall to the ground for a free followup. There's just a boatload of stuff other than "I attack" you can do in the game and it's really inspiring.<br/><br/>We had a fight in Whitehack with a bunch of hyenas where I made a point of describing where the fight took place in relation to the camp fire, but I didn't think of having the hyenas make the PCs fall back into the fire. Having an orc push a PC off a ledge (save negates) for an instant kill will probably be met with a gasp from the players, because we haven't used those things. I will have the opponents lead the way with nasty things to do, and I'm sure the players will catch on and retaliate. That's something I look forward to.<br/><br/>If anyone is curious you can find gameplay videos of For Honor on YouTube. Just note that the game plays differently depending on which class you use, so a spear-user will keep distance while a dagger-user will be up close. The things they do in combat look completely different, even if they are based on the same principles. Look for warlord gameplay if you want to see a shield and sword user that pushes people around with the shield. In addition to the great combat gameplay, I really enjoy the visual style used in the setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460572/#Comment_460572" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-23T08:34:30+00:00" title="February 23, 2017  8:34AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2017 8:35AM by Jonas Ferry.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>And finally, I noticed that my group doesn't read the rules even when I hand them separatedly.

You could fight with wooden or padded weapons that only do 1 HP damage to signify a hit, and could allow throws off ledges or into fires to be initiated (marked), but stopped at the last moment. This way you could practice mixing things up in combat without the fear of permanent death in a dungeon.<br/><br/>Of course you could do a mock combat test with generic characters before the game starts, but using the actual PCs gives a chance to put them in a new situation and see how they handle a practice duel against a superior opponent. I'm going to try to include it next session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460573/#Comment_460573" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-23T12:40:48+00:00" title="February 23, 2017 12:40PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My advice to the OP is to switch to Theater of the Mind without using the defensive movement, just see how it changes on its own without any tools you were using to make grid combat work a particular way. I find with non-grid combat it is often about taking things out, not adding them in, because everyone is imagining a situation in their head, I find there tends to be a lot less "I attack" type actions.

I mean, perhaps it's just a 10' fall, but the real problem is that now that person is separated from the group, it will take a few turns for him to get back to the fight and whoever pushed him can immediately attack someone else. <br/><br/>The good part of this is that, while you can get everyone safely used to the mechanic and still hinders the side of whoever falls, you're introducing the possibility that it could become a lethal move later. I'd allow PCs the chance of trying to grab to a ledge or whatever after they fall their save, still taking some damage and perhaps losing a weapon, but lethal falls are okay too.<br/><br/>On one of the nicest battles we have had lately, I used a war golem that had a few small, lousy flamethrowers. They didn't do much beside keeping PCs from climbing and hanging to the golem for too long... except that they turned whatever path the golem took into a field of flames. Players had to move and run continuously to avoid the flames in order to attack the golem. You don't even have to go too much into high fantasy to put a simple brazier, or oil spot that can be turned/ignited either by the players or NPCs.<br/><br/>Thanks for the inspiration btw, I'm gonna include a few more enviromental hazards on my next battle!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460630/#Comment_460630" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-23T22:18:51+00:00" title="February 23, 2017 10:18PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some additional thoughts:<br/><br/>* I love the implication (from your post) that in the video game, having a shield gives you an advantage when trying to "push people around". That finally gives a better dynamic for shield-users which could be leveraged into a tactical framework (the tradeoffs of shield vs. no shield). I'll be chewing on that for a while!<br/><br/>* When it comes to things like "pushing people off cliffs", the best method, I believe, is to make a "ruling" on the spot, with the help of the players. Make it clear that these rulings set a precedent, and that they apply equally to the PCs and their foes. This gives everyone at the table a motive for trying to make the rules as fair as possible, and then gets them to buy into them, since they were "built" together, by team effort. ("Should the Ogre get a saving throw to stumble instead of going flying? If he were pushing you off, do you think your PC should get one?")<br/><br/>* A few games, like Feng Shui and Apocalypse World, have clever ways of incentivizing the use of "environmental hazards".<br/><br/>Consider something like this:<br/><br/>When the PCs want to "survey" a scene, they each name (ask about; describe; invent; explore) something in the arena. It could be a chandelier or a table or a gaping pit. Perhaps if you have a chance to actually interact with it ("I tip over the table"), you get a bonus to the roll.<br/><br/>What's the roll?<br/><br/>Some kind of "Combat Reflexes" or "combat Veteran" or some similar thing which determines your ability to use tactics to your advantage.<br/><br/>Now, for each aspect, you roll. On a good roll, you have an idea how it could be used to your advantage - and this becomes a potential bonus for you, if you can use it. On a failed roll, though, it's a potential disadvantage (or bonus for the enemy), which they can try to use to their advantage.<br/><br/>Now you have a scene with defined tactical features and you're ready to rock. The bonuses and penalties encourage you to engage with all of them. (Whether for your advantage or to prevent the enemy from seizing one.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460632/#Comment_460632" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-23T22:45:45+00:00" title="February 23, 2017 10:45PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have yet to see it work. Players making up their own enviromental advantages that is. I tried before and since it didn't felt intuitive for the players at first glance we dropped it fast. Perhaps yoy may have better luck with it. In my case I ended up resorting to a checklist whenever I draw the battleground on the mat right before the battle starts. I mentally go through:<br/><br/>-how the general layout of the place goes. It usually comes with one enviromental hazard or visibility disadvantage like fog, rain, dust, etc.<br/>-drop a few obstacles/cover to dress the place, randomly most of the time<br/>-indicate difficult terrain or other visible features<br/>-place visible opponents<br/>-point the players where are their characters coming from and ask them to put their minis in marching order. Negotiate minor adjustments to that according narration/my own mental space.<br/><br/>I'll try rising it to at least three hazards/opportunities for the terrain that make sense. Presenting them to the players works somewhat like a puzzle. They still have to come up with a plan to get there and use them in the right time, while avoiding their opponents to use it against them. Letting the players come up with them, while it frees you from thinking on such options, enables them to optimize their advantages to the most effective ones. Like this player in my group that keeps asking for powder and explosives when he goes to buy something in a fantasy low-tech setting.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460640/#Comment_460640" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-24T02:25:28+00:00" title="February 24, 2017  2:25AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It certainly depends on how the players (meaning all of you, as  a group) want to approach this, and what your play goals are.<br/><br/>There is a wide spectrum between "GM invents" and "Player invents", and that's what I would want to explore. For instance, consider an option where the player simply gets to ask a question:<br/><br/>"Near the North exit, by the fire, is there anything which could be used to claim a defensible position?"<br/><br/>"If the door near the stairs is blocked, what's the best alternative way to get to the altar?"<br/><br/>Then, the GM answers the question. <br/><br/>In Apocalypse World, your "skill" determines *how many* of these questions you get to ask (and from a pre-defined list), but the answers, if you can take advantage of them, are always potentially favorable. (e.g. Take that alternate route to the altar, and you get a bonus to do so, because you spotted it ahead of time.)<br/><br/>The alternative I'm suggesting is that the roll, instead, determines what kind of advantage (and to whom) that aspect grants. This means that you can't just name any old thing; ask for "powder and explosives", and you could be arming your enemy with a frightening weapon.<br/><br/>For instance, find the defensible position near the North exit, on a successful roll, means you have a place to fall back to (and you can defend it with an advantage). On a failed roll, however, your character can't get in position to use that to his advantage in time, and, instead, suffers a penalty if he tries to defend his allies anywhere <i>except</i> from that position.<br/><br/>The details would have to be worked out for the particular dynamic you're going for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460653/#Comment_460653" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-24T14:17:30+00:00" title="February 24, 2017  2:17PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well thought!

Then, a roll or other mechanism determines whether they have to foresight, instincts, or experience to take advantage of that feature or whether their enemy does, instead.<br/><br/>This could even be used to determine where the PCs' "starting positions" are.<br/><br/>In other words, at the start of the battle, we determine that there is a "higher ground" which would advantageous to hold. I can announce that I want to be there when I face off against the Orcs. Then we roll to determine starting position (not unlike "rolling initiative") and see if a) you're there and in position when battle begins, or b) the Orcs have gotten there first or otherwise outmaneuvered you, leaving you at a disadvantage.<br/><br/>I've used a more crude version of this in my D&amp;D games (just one roll for the entire 'side'), and it worked well.

In each round, you didn't just "attack or defend". On top of your regular rolls, you could take an action to improve your position. An aggressive stance gave you a bonus die to attack. A defensive one gave you a bonus die to defend. But far more likely to help was to make an attempt to develop a tactical advantage, get away from an enemy, close the distance, or something similar. <br/><br/>This meant that each round you would most likely think about tactical positioning, since doing so didn't 'cost you a round of attacking' or otherwise penalize you. <br/><br/>I thought that was really cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460752/#Comment_460752" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-27T16:52:23+00:00" title="February 27, 2017  4:52PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd highly recommend to implement everything you can in a way that players (not PCs) could do things simultaneously. I mean, if as a player, on your turn, you have to engage with one or several mechanics that require you to take choices, you will probably stall the game a bit. Especially if you can't take most of those choices between turns, as whatever the opponents or other players will do has the chance to make you change your plans completely.<br/><br/>On games with such granularity, dead time from turn to turn may end up making the players prone to chat, play with their cellphones or seek other distractions. Some groups are okay with this; though I prefer to keep things rolling, and if that means dropping some mechanics to do so I'll definitely go for it.<br/><br/>But that's not a solution, that's just avoiding things "because they take too much time". If instead there was something you could do outside your turn (besides things like "opportunity attacks" or otherwise using a sort of reaction mechanic) then it would be easier to keep everyone's attention on the game.

The players mainly make fictional choices which I as the GM convert instantly into mechanics. No dead air time, something's happening constantly unless somebody explicitly calls for a time-out to think - which is an invitation for the others to debate their action choice with them. When I'm not doing this myself, I flag one of the other players to "run" the combat.<br/><b>2)</b> Reaction mechanics: the way combat works in my homebrew, characters can pay initiative score to react to enemy action. Reactions are limited to natural instincts, prepared contingencies and special abilities usable as reactions, but that still leaves the players plenty to do off-turn. To play well, you have to theoretically be on hand 100% of the time to take that opportunity attack or shield block or backstep maneuver or other such minor stuff - if you're not playing attention, you're not getting those advantages even when they might be just the thing to save your bacon.<br/><b>3)</b> Tactical tenseness: the way we run combats, they're f'ing serious business. You need to be on top of where your character is, what the enemy is doing and what your friends are doing, or you're just going to spout gibberish when it's your turn. The players can't <i>afford</i> to not pay attention, because that's how you end up declaring "I attack monster X", and the GM replies with "OK, but because they're through a doorway, and two other people have used the doorway this turn, you're taking a -4 to attack due to traffic congestion; furthermore, you obviously drop your lantern as you engage in melee, leaving the entire party in darkness." So good job champ, you just got everybody killed because you couldn't keep your head out of your phone/ass.<br/><br/>Of course all that only works if the strategic-level context of the combat matters so that there's actually a reason to have a combat. Luckily the D&amp;D system is so lethal and advantages of combat so contingent that a <i>boring</i> combat is quite rare - better to not have the combat at all if you're not invested in the outcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20848/osr-combat-shifting-round-to-round" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20848/osr-combat-shifting-round-to-round" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20848/osr-combat-shifting-round-to-round/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20848%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20848%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
