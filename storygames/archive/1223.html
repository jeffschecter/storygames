                    Okay, no, <a href="http://www.believermag.com/issues/200608/?read=interview_soderbergh" rel="nofollow">not really</a>, but...<br/><br/><i>"The hardest thing in the world is to be good and clear when creating anything.

Because you don't often get encouragement to do that, to be good and clear."</i><br/><br/>If the process of writing <i>frogger</i> (which if nothing else made me appreciate the 'full time' designers and the wonderful work they do -- I don't know why fiction is easier for me, but it is) and the discussions ongoing about Stakes and the like do nothing else, they illustrate this point.                </div>
