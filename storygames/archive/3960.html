It's gotten me excited enough to start digging in real deep to the game to see if I can get a real set of rules together soon.  So thanks guys!!  <br/><br/>Comments and suggestions welcome here or over at The Forge.  If I knew how the hell Jason created the art for the index cards he posted, I would post a few of the cards from our playtest.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90806/#Comment_90806" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T16:52:36+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  4:52PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was back in St. Louis this past weekend and demoed this for my Mom.  I was surprised how quickly she picked this up and rocked out.  She liked the fact that name/location/job generation was random, but that you had some say in the matter.  And after explaining how the cards worked, she was creating characters like <b>Gloria Grinder, Scheming Newspaper Reporter</b>.  Motivation?  "She wants to become the editor-in-chief, but she's a girl in a guy's world!"  Situation?  "Train Wreck!"<br/><br/>She said it was just like making her own mystery story.  Who knew my Mom could bring down the awesome like that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90808/#Comment_90808" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T17:13:07+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  5:13PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason's cards are a bountiful, <i>accessible</i> source of awesome. A lot of your playtest's results were similar to my own group's experiences, as were some of the solutions. I'm particularly interested in the Stake-Meter mechanic. My current hangup with the generator is not with the scene-framing itself, it's how the individual scenes affect each other, building into a cohesive "Act." How are you handling that at the moment?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90812/#Comment_90812" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T17:37:14+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  5:37PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>My current hangup with the generator is not with the scene-framing itself, it's how the individual scenes affect each other, building into a cohesive "Act."</blockquote>\nThat is my current challenge at the moment as well.  I think the Stake-Meter mechanic is a cool idea.  I'm just trying to find a way to make it feel "natural".  But it might be just as easy to set the Stakes at 1-3 (where 1 is talking and 3 is violent) and let them go up and down during play.  But I have two issues there:<br/><br/>1. I'm working with a nine scene structure with three 3-scene Acts.  That doesn't give much room for moving up and down a lot.  <br/>2. I'm not sure I like telling the players that "this scene needs to be mellow/violent".  Because you might watch a scene/conflict develop that gets nasty, and the next scene the players could be wanting a follow-up that is even more bloody.  I want this to be a cool shove in the right direction, but not break the flow of the story they are creating together.<br/><br/>But I am doing something with the three-Act structure.  Currently I'm placing all the cards down at once in such a way that each card touches at least one other card.  Cards which touch only one card are considered to be "Isolated".  And cards which are surrounded by four other cards are considered "Trapped".  My current thinking is that cards cannot be Trapped in the first Act, and they cannot be Isolated in the third act.  I'm trying to push the narrative towards a certain type of ending, and that is one way I hope to accomplish it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
