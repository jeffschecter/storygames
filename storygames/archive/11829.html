A comment like "I want to play a game about zombie doctors!" turns into a discussion about what system would be best.  And a person generally doesn't make that kind of comment unless they are already inspired towards certain kinds of characters with certain kinds of relationships.  Maybe a zombie doctor, a ghoul psychiatrist, and an unethics board that's out to get their licenses revoked.<br/><br/>I have trouble seeing how it could be otherwise.  If system matters, but there's no One True System, then system can't be the first choice made; it must be dependent on some other source of inspiration.

Well, not yet, but there is an astounding number of very <i>specific</i> games out there (from games about bug-eating academicals to games about suicidee relatives). Furthermore, I think the implication is that, since there is no "one true system" and you want a game about zombie doctors, you should write it...pretty much on the spot maybe. We also have an incredible array of practices, mechanics and techniques we can chose from to address what we want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264305/#Comment_264305" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-29T02:37:39+00:00" title="March 29, 2010  2:37AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ Burr<br/>\n<br/>\nthats cool,<br/>\n<br/>\nmy experience has usually been this<br/>\n<br/>\n"hey guys do you want to try this game?"<br/>\n"what game?"<br/>\n"you play this kind of person doing these kinds of things and you roll these kinds of dice"<br/>\n"oh cool lets try that"<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I chose a game to pitch to our group what makes me want to play it is if it has good buzz or looks like something I would like to try.
