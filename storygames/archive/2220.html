<div class="Message">
                    I was looking <a href="http://www.columbinegame.com/" rel="nofollow">this game</a> over at the site and ran across <a href="http://www.columbinegame.com/statement.htm" rel="nofollow">the Artist's Statement</a> after reading <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/columns/0,72491-0.html?tw=rss.index" rel="nofollow">this article at Wired</a>.<br/><br/>It is interesting and I am wondering what is going to happen when someone brings a game to our community that is interesting, through-provoking and morally repugnant.<br/><br/>Worth a read:<br/><br/><i>ARTIST'S STATEMENT:<br/>A Meditation on Super Columbine Massacre RPG!<br/><br/>        When I discovered a program called RPG Maker, I knew I had to achieve my childhood ambition of designing a video game. The question of what the gameâ€™s subject would be came almost instantly; a striking event from my own formative years tugged at my instincts to make the â€œunthinkableâ€ game. Little did I know as I began to research the Columbine shooting on April 20th, 1999 that the subject never went away in the minds of many others, either. From Germany to Australia and all across the United States, thousands of websites devoted to providing information/criticism/critique of the incident came to my attention. The question at the center of the storm was an elusive one: â€œwhy did they do it?â€<br/><br/><br/>        Thus far, video games have been relegated to escapist entertainmentâ€”an industry known best for little blue hedgehogs and plucky mustached plumbers bouncing about in fantasy worlds. There is little in the realm of socially conscious gamingâ€”software that does more than merely amuse for a few idle hours. Yet while some low-selling games offer pedagogical education (in geography, math, etc.), games that genuinely challenge social taboos or confront real cultural issues are nearly non-existent. I wanted to make something that mattered; I wasnâ€™t willing to put months of my scant free time into an easily forgotten adventure set in a mythical realm of dragons or spaceships.<br/><br/><br/>        I knew I had to be true to the events of the Columbine school shootingâ€”as true as I could be while maintaining respect for the tragically deceased; it was a more delicate balance of personal morality than many of my detractors imagine I took. Since 1999 so many mistruths have been spoken and political postures have been struck in the wake of the shooting that I didnâ€™t want to fall into the speculative pitfalls of much of the mediaâ€™s coverage. The game had to be told from the perspective of the shootingâ€™s greatest enigmas of all: Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. They left behind many of their thoughtsâ€”some frightening, some deplorable, some comical, and some deeply enraged. I collected all of them and assembled them into a role-playing game aesthetically reminiscent of those I would play in my own youth. It only made sense, I thought, to make this game feel like a combination of reading, playing, and thinking.<br/><br/><br/>        The end resultâ€”now swarming the Internet from one download mirror to another, via personal file transfers on instant messengers and peer-to-peer programsâ€”is a game that has been called nearly every hyperbole in the English language. Its creator, known for over a year only as the alias â€œColumbin,â€ has been described as a â€œgenius,â€ a â€œsick human being,â€ a â€œreal philosopher,â€ and even â€œthe Antichrist.â€ The gameâ€™s success comes not from its technical accomplishments or engaging gameplay but rather the provocative polarization it elicits from audiences. One thing can be certain, though: â€˜Super Columbine Massacre RPG!â€™ is a bit unlike anything already in the cultural canon and pushes the envelope as to what a video game can be.<br/><br/><br/>        The lingering questionâ€”that grand burning query so many have tried to answerâ€”is one I believe this game allows us to at least access in a more honest way. Beyond the simple platitudes and panaceas of gun control, media ratings/censorship, bully prevention programs, and parental supervision remains a glaring possibility: that the society we have created is deeply moribund. This game asks more of its audience than rudimentary button-pushing and map navigation; it implores introspection. This is why the gameâ€™s forum is equally important to the SCMRPG project. Through it, people from six continents and all walks of life are discussing the game itself and the incident it is based on. Some of them confess childhood pain or share personal feelings on the shooting. Some of them sustain vulgar diatribes or accuse the creator of wrongdoing. Some of them discuss the gameâ€™s social implications in a broader context. At the end of the day, the understanding of the Columbine school shooting is deepened and redefined. That is the real object of the game.<br/><br/><br/>        Somewhere between April 20th, 1999 and September 11th, 2001, America entered into a new, terrifying, and desperate era. Citizens can no longer afford to believe the necessary illusions of modern society. In an age when hastily-formed scapegoats and false dichotomies of â€œgoodâ€ and â€œevilâ€ run rampant, SCMRPG dares us into a realm of grey morality with nuanced perspectives of suffering, vengeance, horror, and reflection. In the words of Harrisâ€™ friend Brooks Brown, there are â€œno easy answersâ€ to such a socially indicting tragedy. As humanity teeters precariously on the threshold of collapseâ€”politically, ideologically, and environmentally, the days of comatose media coverage and a subservient populace cannot remain. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, through their furious words and malevolent actions, can be understood as the canaries in the mineâ€”foretelling of an â€œapocalypse soonâ€ for those remaining to ponder their deeds. With â€˜Super Columbine Massacre RPG!,â€™ I present to you one of the darkest days in modern history and ask, â€œAre we willing to look in the mirror?â€<br/><br/>        â€”Danny Ledonne, "Columbin" </i> </div>

                            Oh, if we look around, isn't something like this already out there? Especially considering that Lenonne admits that it's not the gameplay that's important, but that people discuss it? I wonder how many people have actually seen Maplethorp's photos, and yet still discuss them, and their validity as art? That is, the thing itself doesn't have it's original function at all, but a secondary function caused by it's controversial nature.<br/>
<br/>
Hell, we could probably credit the FATAL team with being as "thought-provoking." That is, I think it's actually dumb-easy to be a provocateur. I don't credit Ledonne above at all - any good work coming out of the discussions caused by his game are to the credit of the people talking, not Ledonne. Presumably if they weren't talking about his game, they'd be talking about something else.<br/>
<br/>
Now, another perspective. What about Carry? I mean I think we already have RPGs that are actually thought-provoking from play, and not simply reaction to their existances. That said, I think that they cause very little splash.<br/>
<br/>
Power-Kill is somewhere in between. Violence (the RPG) seems to me to be an example of provocation. I've never heard of any actual play of either of these games. Little Fears, ironically, caused this sort of reaction, despite the fact that actual play shows it to be thought-provoking in good ways, from all accounts.<br/>
<br/>
From yet another POV, almost all RPGs have some element of such thought-provocation already. Certainly any "narrativism-promoting" RPG that's actually played that way. Narrativism is defined as making such statements in play.<br/>
<br/>
So any "9/11: the Bitchslapping" RPG title that comes out will, I think, have pretty little impact overall. Whether or not the gameplay actually has a message or provokes thought itself.<br/>

                            I think the only thing morally repugnant is that it got pulled from the contest.  I tend to agree <a href="http://interactive.usc.edu/members/tfullerton/archives/007203.html" rel="nofollow">with Tracy Fullerton and the University of Southern Cal</a> in this matter.  I do think the game has become a rallying point for people who want games to tackle difficult, real world issues (probably more so than the game itself actually deserves), but you've got to start somewhere.                        </div>

                            I used to be a film projectionist for classes taught by Jim Hoberman. He's a writer and film critic and his classes at Cooper Union and NYU were excellent, so I eagerly sat in on them as I was working. The most important thing I learned from him as he covered everything from The Bodyguard to GI Jane is that the intentions of the artist are secondary to how the art is received into its contemporary culture. That's a nice way of putting it. Perhaps more succinctly: Artists' intents are for shit (mine included). Art stands on its own and is judged by its reception.                        </div>

<b>Hi Judd</b>,<br/>
<br/>
I agree that Super Columbine Massacre RPG is interesting, and thought provoking, but morally repugnant? The creator seems to have given lots of consideration to the problems of discussing the subject matter. More than say the movie Zero Day that suggests Kleibold and Harris went on a rampage because of repressed homosexuality. That I would call morally repugnant. Perhaps your question wasn't pointing directly at the video game, so I'll stop here.<br/>
<br/>
To answer your question, I will either embrace or ignore that person's work, depending on what it is. Likely I will lean more towards embracing. If we ever imagine seeing a <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=4223.0" rel="nofollow">Page45</a> type RPG store, or RPG's in a page45 store we need to have games that are pushing into places normal RPG's fear to tread. I know for my game, "Silence Keeps Me A Victim." This is an angle I hope to be able to leverage.<br/>
<br/>
I would also like to <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/danny-ledonne/feature-columbine-rpg-creator-talks-about-dawson-shooting-201829.php" rel="nofollow">add more to the discussion, of the possible dangers.</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Hi Luke</b>,<br/>
<br/>
Are you saying that for instance, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Darger" rel="nofollow">Henry Darger's</a> Art had no value until after his death, when it finally came under scrutiny and was therefore finally judged by an audience?                        </div>

I'm absolutely NOT talking about the value of art. I am merely saying that, whatever Darger intended is moot. Whatever he thought his art meant doesn't mean shit. His art means something different to each member of his audience and means something even more different to his unintended audience.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I think Darger's stuff is beyond awesome.<br/>
So. Fucking. Weird.<br/>

<b>Hi Luke and Judd</b>,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you both for the clarifications.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Hi everyone</b>,<br/>
<br/>
I just want to clear up what I meant by my link to the possible dangers. I'm not blaming the creator of Super Columbine Massacre RPG for the Dawson college shootings in Canada last year. What I meant to point to was his reaction to finding out about the shooting and the alleged connection to his game.                        </div>

<p>I think there's some gnarly stuff being written already. Dogs in the Vineyard is about the violence inherent in theocracy (or, really, any government run by decree). Carry's about the effects of war on the humans fighting them. Shock: is about the alienation caused by rapidly changing society (I've played games about <em>suicide</em>, thank you Judd "This game is dark" Karlman). Sorcerer's about power dynamics between intimates. I don't think any of these break serious taboos, but they do better stuff than provoking underconsidered responses: they make you engage subject matter that you'd otherwise have a hard time engaging.</p>
<p>I find <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Darger" rel="nofollow">Darger's</a> magnum opus fascinating. It's absolutely epic. Honestly, I feel really lucky that he was inclined to be creative enough to actually record his vision in a way that can be read because I think most of the time, schizophrenics don't have (or need) that ability. I mean, he gives us a way to see into this fantasy world of his that he created out of love and compulsion. He could have kept it all in his mind and we'd have never gained that perspective, or he could have left us with something like <a href="http://www.voynich.nu/" rel="nofollow">MS408</a> that would be completely indecipherable. He actually tells us a story that details his moral structure. His intention is relevant only insofar as we want to know what it <em>is</em>; he certainly never intended it to be read, displayed, or discussed.</p>
<p>Clyde, your discussion about Silence Makes Me A Victim immediately brought Henry Darger to my mind. I'm glad you know about him. I'd really love to see a Vivian Girls RPG, and I think such a thing really <em>would</em> pierce some taboos.</p>

                            If you have not seen it, Gus Van Sant's Elephant is perhaps the most even-handed (almost subliminal) discussion of school shootings like Columbine.<br>
<br>
I found the film riviting... I've seen it twice now and recommend it on theme alone.<br>
<br>
And just to put my two cents in, I have no played this game, but the opening Artist's Statement is eloquent and brilliantly written. It shows that he at least analyzed why he was doing what he was doing... whether he succeeded or not. That is more than I can say for most of humanity.<br>
<br>
Lukzu - I agree. It does not matter what my intentions are. You can pretend to be an artiste all day long with trite issues in your "art", but if no one receives your work the way you wanted, your system of communication failed. And art... above all else... is about communication.<br>

<p>Jim, you trivialize an important question in art. It has nothing to do with the pretension of wearing a beret, smoking Galoises, and complaining that no one understands you. Imagine that you make a movie about your family. In it, your mom's alcoholism contributes to your brother and you not talking since Christmas, 1986*. But a lot of people watch the movie and decide that your dad's a dick for not supporting your mom. Let's say even your <em>dad</em> thinks that that's what you were saying. And then another group thinks that it's a metaphor for the Iraq war, with your dad representing the US, your mom representing Saddam Hussein, and your brother and you representing the Iraqis and Iranis, respectively.</p>
<p>Have you failed at communication? Maybe, if that was really your intent (I really disagree with your assessment of communication as central to art). But what Luke's saying (I presume â€” I'm pretty sure we hold similar views on this) is that your intentions <em>don't factor</em> into the audience's experience. Whether or not you've communicated is only evident to you, the creator. You've made an artifact that lives on irrespective of your wishes, not even despite them.</p>
<p>That's why "artist's statements" have become so requisite as art has become less and less literal over the last century. Personally, I think that habit makes for art with two parts â€” the artifact itself and a weakly written statement. If the artist were a good writer, they would have become a writer, not a painter or video game designer or whatever. That this statement works (or is even gramatically functional) is the exception and clearly shows that "Columbin" was really thinking about what he was doing. It would certainly be stronger, though, if it wasn't needed, right?</p>
<p>* If anyone's wondering, I don't know Jim. I'm making up a family history.</p>

                            I think you bring up a great point, Joshua. And I agree entirely with what Luke is saying... I was just bringing up another perspective.<br>
<br>
Critical Theory teaches us NEW ways to analyze "Art," none of which really matters to the audience's response to a THING.<br>
<br>
I'll use music as an example. I completely lack the vocabulary to tell you why I love Tool. But I know it's complex and textured... heavily layered with theme and math... blah blah blah. It does not stop me from appreciating it... hence the audience response. But if Tool didn't know how to play in 7/5 time, then they wouldn't sound like Tool, but instead like Korn.<br>
<br>
Too many people have access to the tools of communication, without any knowledge of how to use those tools. Picasso once said, "Art calls for complete mastery of techniques, developed by reflection within the soul." The average Indie-movie is made by someone that watched a few DVD extras and wants to film his buddies doing cocaine in the desert... or to quote Eric Cartman... "It's all gay cowboys eating pudding." We've gained thousands of tools of communication, but we've lost the art of brevity. We need disclaimers and statements and author notes and every manner of clause to protect us from the fires of the internet and the prying eyes of indolent mothers.<br>
<br>
I think the internet has given us this incredible tool of communication that people are only using for shouting. (Hell. I do it. I'm learning to edit myself. But I do it. And I used to write for a living). And we're both empowered and emasculated by it. We all barf out data at such an impossible rate that we think everyone is listening as fast as we're puking.<br>
<br>
I went to school to learn to communicate with the written form, but I've lost touch with how to do that anymore. I type about 3,000 useless words a day for one of my six blogs and I wonder why I don't get anything done anymore... instead of letting the WLD speak for itself, I found the need to fill the last two pages with all this nonsense so that everyone would understand that mistakes exist because I don't want to admit that I'm a hack... instead of nodding in agreement with you and Luke, I found the need to post this annoyingly verbose comment... And so forth. I can't imagine James Joyce at a public reading of his work explaining the obsenities in Ulysses.<br/>
<br/>
I think you're right. I'm not arguing any particularly point. My own personal bias is that we spend too much time talking about the art... and nothing stands on its own anymore. Pick a favorite show, and someone somewhere will defend the dumbest episodes with... "But you have to wait until Season Three when the writers finally started... blah blah blah." You mean it took more than 50 episodes before they found their voice?<br/>
<br/>
Art that doesn't communicate anything is masturbatory... which is probably why I don't play a particular fantasy RPG anymore. We've reached an age where we don't analyze why we are saying something... but rather, "how loud can I say this?" Look at Maddox's website. It's quite possibly the busiest place on the net... but what is it really saying? Communicating? Angst? Sarcasm? Derision? Is that the art of the 21st century?<br/>
<br/>
[I don't have an answer there. Sorry.]<br/>
<br/>
Picasso also said, "People want to find a "meaning" in everything and everyone. That's the disease of our age, an age that is anything but practical but believes itself to be more practical than any other age."<br/>
<br/>
Man. I suck. I just took this tangent into another coordinate plane. Someone ban me before I post again.<br/>
<br/>
* If anyone's wondering, Joshua's description was scarily accurate. Except I've never made a movie... not that I don't want to.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            i just wanted to add that not all art is supposed to be communication. when i do illustration or design, the purpose of that is communication. but then there's fine art too. the drive to create something beautiful, for beauty's sake only, is not inferior.                        </div>

                            You are... in fact... communicating beauty, aren't you? You wouldn't do that with a flaming skull. Just as when I write poetry, I don't use the word sepsis to make the ready feel good about himself.<br/>
<br/>
btw... jennifer... i love the progression of your work... i like where your shading is going. I could banter with you all day about line work and what not, but your drafting quality is really improving and your Valentine is very strong... the cover of Mortal Coils doesn't suck either. But your line work has changed since then and you're Valentine is subtler... is that a word?<br/>

it communicates more with brevity, I think...<br/>

                            (1) Something is not <i>art</i> just because someone issued an "artist's statement."  I know people who create art daily through music, writing, photography, cooking -- including making sandwiches, thank you very much -- and while they may discuss it if they speak to someone who is genuinely interested, they don't seem to feel the need to issue "artist's statements."<br/>
<br/>
(2) Somehow, entitling a piece of <i>art</i> "Super Columbine Massacre RPG" does nothing to enhance credibility in my eyes.  It smacks of, shall we say, someone who figures that if you bought "Grand Theft Auto", you're going to shell out $40 for even more violence and controversy.<br/>
<br/>
(3) Do games <b>have</b> to be <i>art</i>?  I don't want the kind of <i>art</i> that requires "artist's statements" in my games.  I can live without.  But I DO like the kind of Art that is recognizable by its quality, creativity, thoughtfulness, etc., and just impresses the hell out of me.   Sometimes I do encounter it.  Sometimes the authors will even, when questioned, have interesting things to say about why they wrote this game.  But until I've played the game and been impressed by its Art (or at least have been impressed by the author's previous work as Art), I really don't give a gnat's fart about about "artist's statements."                        </div>

                            My working assumption is that Art-with-a-capital-A died sometime between the World Wars.  Dada and Cubism and High Modernism were still Art, just barely -- afterwards, nothing.  Now there's just art-with-a-small-a.  <br/><br/>If you look at the majority of highbrow contemporary art, it's garbage. So is the majority of all art, everywhere.  There's a small fraction of art that I think is good, and <i>even that fraction</i> isn't Art.  Cause Art is dead.  <br/><br/>That's my working assumption, and it avoids a lot of circular arguments about Art like the one that's developing in this thread.                        </div>

                            Nah, I see Art on a daily basis.  It has to do with people excelling in what they do for the sheer love of it, and creating something that is admirable, more than the sum of its parts, because that's where their heart is.  And it doesn't come with a membership card.  :-}                        </div>

<p>Art needn't communicate. It's just one thing it's really good for. I'm totally with Jenn on this. The reception of a piece of art is an independent process from the creation of one.</p>
<p>An "artist's statement" doesn't make something art. Of course not. Nor does its status as "art" mean that something's highbrow. That's a bourgeois, consumerist view of art, a view that's sold to people to decrease supply. It's a view that started with the rise of the middle class in the 18th century when aculturation was a way to prove that you really deserved your class mobility. But look, anyone who picks up a banjo and rocks out, or scrapbooks, or gardens, or whistles real good is making art. Making a video blog, a photoshopped picture of your friend's head on Abe Vigoda's body, they're all art. Art is what humans do when we're not starving to death or passively consuming someone else's art.</p>
<p>Playing games is art. Making games is art.</p>
<p>Hey, maybe I should flash my accreditation as a Whatisartologist. My dad's a sculptor. My family ate on his art for decades from the sixties into the nineties. He attended and taught at RISD for years, where much of our social circle comes from. I was a lecturer at the Yale School of Art for several years before I started to miss being a designer.</p>
<p>This isn't to claim that my voice is somehow authoritative. But it <em>is</em> to say that it's been a discussion at every dinner party in my entire life. And I can tell you that narrow definitions of art are horseshit. They're proposed by people who want to make sure that someone else is out of the club. Sometimes pottery's not art because it's "a craft". Sometimes photography's not art because it's mediated by a machine (I know, it's crazy, but that was the argument in the early 20th century). But the most salient features of the art that people actually respect â€” the creation of an artifact (however ephemeral it may be) using the skill of its creators â€” is present in all of them. That's what we care about, isn't it? A phenomenon that reflects the human spirit (possibly through communication, but it could happen otherwise), a mark on the universe that lets us know that someone else was there. Maybe even someone we respect.</p>

                            At the danger of rerailing the thread (anyone ever feel like we just ask a little too much out of that humble little word 'art'?), looking at all the hooplah around the game alongside descriptions of it (including those from Columbine survivors), it seems there might be a more basic lesson to distill from all this: <b>be careful what you name your game</b>.<br/><br/>It may be the only thing someone ever responds to about it, so if you are dealing with serious subject matter, give it a suitably serious name.  Don't get silly at the last moment and give it an ironic/hyperbolic/sarcastic name (which can be harder than it looks--the long process of creation can leave you a little daffy sometimes).  If this guy hadn't named it what he named it, I sincerely doubt he would be having any of these problems.<br/><br/>So many of the people responding to it clearly haven't done more than hear the name and lumped it in into the category of first-person shooter games.  Doing that, yeah, would have been pretty tasteless (Grand Theft Auto with schoolkids to shoot, yay!), but that doesn't look like what the game actually is.                        </div>

                            To bring it back down from the general to the specific...<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I managed to get a copy of <i>Super Columbine Massacre RPG</i>, and it actually kind of sucks. Not that it's tasteless or lacking in thought, just the gameplay is pretty annoying. Mostly, these failings appear to be due to limitations in the tools. There's a really annoying sneaking sequence right up front that makes you quit and reload if you fail, and it's really a chore. Actually, the whole game feels like a nauseating chore... you want to keep playing to see what clever gems the author has presented, but there's a general lack of fun play.<br/><br/>A game that was morally provocative while being entertaining to play would probably have been more interesting.

                            Okay, I realize I can be pretty circumspect, so let me try to clear up what I was trying to say and respond to the rest.<br><br>Actually, to be quite clear about what I said, I was making a statement about what we could learn from the way in which this particular object was received, which is what I sort of thought was the original point of the thread (hence the joke about rerailing).  I didn't actually attribute any particular motive to that particular game designer. <br/><br/>His intentions or state of mind I, in fact, quite deliberately did not describe.  I wanted to shift the issue away from this instance to something more broadly construed. I have yet to see any evidence, though, that he actually intended the mess that happened--sure, he chose a name he thought would grab attention, that is a far cry from saying that he wanted his game to be cited by a rl-shooter and become the latest whipping boy/tragic martyr to the whole videogame violence debate. <br/><br/>In regards to naming being an afterthought, please note I couched all that language in a prescriptive and not descriptive frame--in part because I have a tendency to name my work as a throwaway, a side issue with only passing concern for how tightly it corresponds with the content.  I will also add, that something being an afterthought has next to nothing to do with whether it is done intentionally. He might have named it, as a flip afterthought, thinking "oh yeah, that's catchy."<br/><br/>'Everyone involved striking their favorite pose'...hmm, well I'll point to the content of the post Jonathan Walton linked.  There is very little pose and much substance to it--it is crafted in regards to the agenda of a specific organization in relationship to its support of another particular organization and its ends.<br/><br/>The use of the term 'everyone' tends to be either disingenuous or just plain sloppy--allowing you to mock everyone involved for striking a knee-jerk response while engaging in one of your own.  Making it easy, too, for people to never actually have to talk to each other.  If Curly meant that he examined every statement on the issue as well as the past stances of each individual who made that statement...well, yes, Mike is right, he was just making a factual correction to statements he had misattributed to me about the artist's intentions.<br/><br/>However, getting to label all those textured, substantive responses with worthless labels like "think piece" and "branding" strategies, seems just worse that pointless. <br/><br/>Anyone change their mind? I did.  I started out thinking this guy was a worthless shill exploiting a tragic moment, and came out thinking he was a guy curious to try some interesting directions in rpg-videogames who just got caught in something a lot bigger than he expected.  I came away thinking that there are some real problems (one way or another) with a contestant being eliminated for the content of his work after the judges already examined it and deemed it a meaningful entry.  <br/><br/>And that doesn't even count how the 'scandal' (a loaded term, too) makes me wonder, somewhat absently, about the potential for investigating the visceral, physical dimension of the ethical that often gets lost in purely verbal discussions.  But, who knows, maybe that is just my favorite pose.                        </br></br></div>

I get it.  But the Abortion D20 thread on RPG.Net made me think of think of this thread, too.  I'm glad Judd started this thread, even though it's given me a lot of glum thoughts.                        </div>

In the end, I guess I'm not wondering much as far as my own reaction goes.  If the game is "morally repugnant", I'm not gonna have fun playing it; it will make me feel icky, and so it won't be an entertainment and I won't play it, even if it's also interesting and thought-provoking.  That said, the <i>Super Columbine Massacre RPG</i> looks neither interesting nor thought-provoking to me -- just provoking! -- but YMMV.  We're all interested in different things.<br/>
<br/>
Do other people <i>have a right</i> to explore morally repugnant themes?  Yes, I believe so.  Hell, if they didn't, half of what we see and read would disappear.<br/>
<br/>
Is it a <i>good idea</i> to explore morally repugnant themes?  That depends on how well it's done, don't it?  We'll rarely all agree on that; even FATAL and RaHoWa have a couple of supporters.<br/>
<br/>
Bottomline for me, though: morally repugnant =  not fun = not a game.  ("It's never been just a game!")                        </div>

                            Videogames are global big business.<br><br>So is tabloid news.<br><br>The pro- and anti- gun lobbies both capitalize on current events as part of their massive fundraising efforts.<br><br>USC's <a href="http://interactive.usc.edu/" rel="nofollow">Interactive Media Division</a> has a slick, branded website;<br/>and they surely derive funding from private sources which have a vested interest in the entertainment industry, and which could withhold future funding if they aren't pleased.<br/><br/>Slamdance is a for-profit institution, and <i>"The Festival has recently leveraged its brand-name recognition to launch Slamdance Media Group, a distribution, talent-management and production company."</i><br/><br/>There's a lot of money in civil lawsuits, too.  If a videogame is implicated in murder and shootings-- then<br/>institutions connected to the game could fear liability, and shooting victims could be looking for someone<br/>with deep pockets, to sue.<br/> <br/>Given the substantial amounts potentially at stake, it would be naive to take all these parties' pronouncements on Super Columbine Massacre RPG at face-value; and automatically trust that no party is acting on base motives of profit and asset-protection, rather than for loftier reasons.<br/><br/>The same goes for other low motives, such as wanting notoriety.  But none of this is a smoking gun-- pardon<br/>the expression.  The kid may have written the game with pure intentions, and named it as he did... in a thoughtful and critical adherence to videogame industry naming-conventions.   Slamdance Media Group  executive Peter Baxter may have evicted the game from his competition as a matter of pure conscience.<br/>And so on.<br/> <br/>I am not opposed to discussing this game and its repercussions.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>
