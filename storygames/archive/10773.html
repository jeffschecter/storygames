There were only two of us, so I decided I'd be both the GM and one of the players.  I learned a lot, etc.  The problem is, it was really good fun to be a player, and now I'm thinking I should construct the game so that the GM gets to play as a player and not just as a GM.  Can you suggest a good way to switch the GM role during play?  A lot of you guys seem to know what you're doing, certainly a hundred times more than myself, so I was wondering if I could harvest some of your knowledge.  Have you played a game where the GM role (as adversary) is successfully shifted during play?<br/><br/>I'm looking for a way that this has been done explicitly, not a game where 'it kind of does that, if you think about it.'  For example, the GM role, if there was one, shifts all over the place in Universalis, as narrative control is something fluid.  That's not the sort of shift in the GM role I'm looking for, nor the advice I need.  I'd like something that shifts the 'GM as adversary' from one player to the other, in no predictable order.<br/><br/>Narrative control is already fluid according to the results of conflict resolution.  I need something that will shift the control of the reactionary role of the GM.  Know what I mean?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238918/#Comment_238918" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-23T15:17:19+00:00" title="October 23, 2009  3:17PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To follow that up, here is an overview of the GM's duties (which I want shifted).

Generally in this kind of game you either have a situation where the position rotates between players at predetermined points, or the rules are constructed in such a fashion that no GM is necessary, though the latter doesn't sound like it's feasible with your game.<br/><br/>Glad it's going well though!<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238977/#Comment_238977" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-24T08:05:40+00:00" title="October 24, 2009  8:05AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan P.</cite>*each be assigned to a separate player at the beginning of each session (Jim decides if rolls are necessary, Wanda narrates criticals, Steve buys stuff) and change by session</blockquote>\nOr change each scene, instead of each session.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Perhaps GM-hood is determined by some other protion of the game system, like "in a conflict, whoever loses the conflict becomes the GM in the next scene of the game" or "whoever has the least/most X points is the GM for the new scene" or some such.

I've played Universalis, which is sort of an auction-for-GM solution, and although it's nice for keeping things fair, it's a bit clunky for the rapidity in scene changes that I'm predicting.  So I think the inter-session solution is the best suggested, so far.\n<blockquote>or the rules are constructed in such a fashion that no GM is necessary, though the latter doesn't sound like it's feasible with your game</blockquote>\nMaybe you're right.  I'm still experimenting with ways to break the GM role into components so that I don't need a GM, like Nathan suggested in his second 'thoughts/suggestions'.<br/><br/>I've been having a brilliant weekend at Gaelcon so I've not had any time to come up with anything satisfying for the game over the last few days.

In those types of set ups, the antagonism comes from within the group, so hypothetically you could systematize scene framing and eliminate the "GM" role. (Do any of those Nordic or Jeep games work that way?)<br/><br/>But if antagonism comes from any sort of external source, then you're stuck. You're going to have to have some sort of GM, be it a static or rotating/shifting role.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239460/#Comment_239460" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T10:49:10+00:00" title="October 28, 2009 10:49AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi there guys, thanks for the input.

I ended up pairing the game down to one stat: Moxie.<br/><br/>Moxie is your vigour, pep, drive and spirit.  It\u2019s what keep you going when all is lost.  Everyone starts with a Moxie of 2.<br/><br/>Each character also has a Forte, chosen from a list of Abilities: Fight, Flight, Head or Heart.  A player chooses the one that suits his character the most.  When he gets into a situation that calls for his Forte, he\u2019ll be more likely to succeed.<br/><br/>Every character also has a Foible.  From the same list of Abilities (excluding the Forte), he chooses the one that best describes his character\u2019s limitations.  When his character gets into a situation that calls for his Foible, he\u2019ll be more likely to fail.<br/><br/>There's more info on <a href="http://cobwebgames.com" rel="nofollow">Cobweb Games</a>, if you're interested.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
