And I often find constructive feedback actively unhelpful.<br/><br/>So, for example. Here are perfectly valid criticisms of Play Unsafe (not all of which I agree with):\n<ul><li>The layout isn't good</li>\n<li>It's too short</li>\n<li>It doesn't give enough examples</li></ul>\nThey're all destructive and useful. So, if enough people say the layout isn't good, I know to improve the layout. If enough people say it's too short...well, actually, I'm happy with the length, but at least I know what their beef is.<br/><br/>When people try and be constructive, it's rarely helpful.<br/><br/>So, for example. The "Too short" criticism. Often, in an attempt to be constructive, people will suggest things to include: a long example of play, exercises, more examples. But, of course, I'd considered all these and rejected them, for different reasons. So the "constructive" part isn't helpful. All I want to know is the criticism: you think it's too short. Got it. Cool.<br/><br/>Similarly, I had an email from someone criticizing Play Unsafe. (You know who you are: thank you and apologies for using you as an example). He suggested Play Unsafe wasn't a good teaching text and, as a solution, suggested including exercises in a new edition. He went into some detail about the exercises.<br/><br/>And, again, my reaction was "Whoa! Go back. I don't want exercises. Tell me the problem again and I'll try and solve it."<br/><br/>Now, of course, there's exceptions. If you say "Left-align your text there", that's useful. That's a definite thing I can use.<br/><br/>But, generally, I want destructive feedback. Just tell me the problem. Don't tell me how to solve it: I'll do that.<br/><br/>Particularly, don't <i>couch</i> your destructive feedback in constructive terms. If what you feel is destructive ("This bugs me"), that's what I want to know. Don't search for solutions unless one occurred to you immediately ("Ooh, that should be like <i>this</i>").<br/><br/>So there you go. Oh, hey, there hasn't been <i>that</i> much criticism of Play Unsafe, you understand. Most of the feedback has been very nice. Just wanted to point that out.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129106/#Comment_129106" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T10:07:03+00:00" title="February 22, 2008 10:07AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the problem in here is semantics...<br/><br/>"Constructive" criticism isn't necessarily telling you how to do stuff. It is giving <b>you</b> help for you to improve it yourself. It can be positive ("do this like X and Y" or "You are doing great! I like it.") or negative ("Don't. That doesn't work.").<br/><br/>"Semantically" speaking, destructive criticism is that which does more harm than good. Like telling lies or kissing butts. Like just saying "I don't like your game" but don't telling you which part he didn't like, and stuff like that. <br/><br/>Now, for what I understand, what you don't like is people telling you ideas that you won't use...<br/><br/>Well, the thing is they are not giving you so you can please them and do exactly that. The idea is to allow those ideas to make you question yourself, your ideas and your work.<br/><br/>It is basically like Brainstorming. It doesn't mean you have to use all of that input. It means the input is supposed to make you think about why you did stuff (many times we actually loose sight of that, which can be why things don't work), and give you new ideas ("this guy's idea is wrong. I wouldn't do it like that. I'd rather do it like this...)-<br/><br/>And in the end, what matters is that you get to improve your work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129134/#Comment_129134" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T10:47:24+00:00" title="February 22, 2008 10:47AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>Just tell me the problem.

Me neither. And when someone <em>does</em> offer me a solution, I do what I can to evaluate it coolly.

Because part of the critique/creator contract is that the critic is there for the benefit of the creator, not to show off their own awesome perceptions.</p>\n<p>I think that "don't criticize without offering a solution" just goes a little too far. "Don't criticize without <em>considering</em> a solution" might be a little closer. When you do that mental exercise, it helps you see what the creator was addressing when they came up with the solution they did. Sometimes, your own solution slips out, but if everyone's being respectful of the format, no one gets insulted.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130211/#Comment_130211" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T10:18:49+00:00" title="February 25, 2008 10:18AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vodkashok</cite>The best feedback I ever received was from a playtest group for D&amp;H from Aberdeen.</blockquote>\nI hope you kissed them on the mouth.

Constructive tries to contribute to the solution to the problem, destructive points it out and tells you just how bad it is.  <br><br>Taken by that definition, I can totally see Graham's point, that Constructive critiscism can be about as useful as telling someone how to write their game, and after all, why bother writing someone else's game? They can do it themselves! There is a third option though, which is a kind of critiscism I don't know the name of. it says "This is <i>good </i>because..." and I like this kind of critiscism too. It helps to point out to people what they are doing right <i>and why</i>, so they can do more of it or reinforce those parts in the rest of the game.<br/><br/>And it doesn't have to be all kitten-cuddles and ego-stroking either; it can be just more critiscism on the pile, to be mulled over with the same intensity as the problems.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

At the least they waste your time and energy while you read and evaluate them, especially if they\u2019re poorly explained. (But they still might prove beneficial, if you would have first designed then rejected that solution yourself, which usually takes more time). They might drag you into lengthy and useless debates if you want to explain why you\u2019re not adopting the proposition. At the worst, they might trap you in a mental tar-pit, orienting your thoughts in an inappropriate direction from which you have to disengage (bad priming).<br/><br/>Accepting feedback can be difficult. Ego. Suggestions can make this harder. Good suggestions might be rejected because of this, even if the designer would have come to this solution if it has not been suggested. \xab Not invented here \xbb syndrome.<br/><br/>Good suggestions that the designer can accept are \u2014 of course \u2014 useful. Bad suggestions can also be.<br/><br/>Suggestions are additional information. Sometimes suggestions, especially very bad suggestions, can show you that something was missed or misunderstood by the critic. You can tell what was misunderstood (and decide if the fault lies in the work, the critic or the testing process).<br/><br/>Suggestions can also point more precisely to the real problem then the feedback itself. Often the point people point to as the problem is not the real source of their critique. (Just as the designed work often does not really correspond to what the designer\u2019s <i>announced</i> goals are.) Suggestions can help to find the root of the problem.<br/><br/><br/>Positive feedback, feedback that identify to the good parts for what they are, is very useful. Positive feedback isn\u2019t ego stroking. It is part of a balanced and useful review. It helps separate the parts that are merrily ok from those that are brilliant or central to the design. The first can be changed easily, either to improve them or to solve other problems; the lasts need much more reflection and caution. It can also counterbalance very negative feedback given by too vocal critics and preserve some things that are not, after all, objective problems, but individual tastes. Give positive feedback, even if in terse form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131598/#Comment_131598" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T08:37:35+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  8:37AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The key word here is "suggestions".
