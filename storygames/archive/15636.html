I love it.<br/><br/>I've played Old School D&amp;D. I love it.<br/><br/>I've heard the name "Dungeon World". I don't know what it is, except obviously that it's supposed to be Old School D&amp;D, but using the Apocalypse World rules.<br/><br/>So tell me: what is Dungeon World, and why would I want to use it rather than, say, OD&amp;D? Not a facetious question: I'm genuinely interested. In particular, I'm interested in finding out how Dungeon World 'does' logistics. <br/><br/>To me, there are two key attractions of the Old School D&amp;D. The first is its emphasis on the sandbox and how story just emerges from what the players do, exploring the world in a haphazard fashion in pursuit of quixotic goals. I get how Dungeon World might do that, because it's sort of what Apocalypse World does.<br/><br/>The second attraction of Old School D&amp;D is logistics, and the tough choices it forces on the players, like: should we try to take these 1,000 gold pieces back to town given that they weigh 100 lbs (or 1000 cn)? How many hirelings should we hire, if we're going to give them a 5% share each? Is it worth trying to take on these orcs, given the risks involved and the potential benefit of fighting them? How much oil do you have left in your lantern - is it enough to get back to the surface before it runs out? And so on. Does Dungeon World force the players to make these kinds of choices too? Is it set up for that sort of thing?<br/><br/>My questions aren't just limited to that - sell me on Dungeon World, please, because I want to like it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354322/#Comment_354322" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-15T09:23:53+00:00" title="January 15, 2012  9:23AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Search the forum.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354325/#Comment_354325" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-15T09:35:32+00:00" title="January 15, 2012  9:35AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noisms</cite>The second attraction of Old School D&amp;D is logistics, and the tough choices it forces on the players, like: should we try to take these 1,000 gold pieces back to town given that they weigh 100 lbs (or 1000 cn)?

I'm not sure how well DW would do that, because there are no overland speeds, or exploration turns and such. But I suppose you could easily write custom moves for that.<br/><br/>As for logistics, I don't think there's any explicit support for it. Just like there isn't really any in oD&amp;D. It emerges from the other elements. But DW definitely forces players to make hard choices, except it's usually as a result of a roll. Like, you mess up a roll and you must decide between dropping your torch into the water and getting smacked by the tentacle or something. Arguing about how to split the treasure is all above and beyond the rules.<br/><br/>Also, you just made me realize something. Dungeon World gives XP for rolling specific stats, much like AW.

You can still use most of the old-school play style. AW tells you to make up the setting in play, as you go along, but nothing is really stopping you from using the moves and harm rules instead of the resolution systems in D&amp;D. You just need to decide what xp system you're using.<br/><br/>2. Characters matter more, and not just because of special moves. It's pretty hard to die in Dw and AW, partly because you can take those debilities, and partly because the GM is encouraged to kill NPCs easily. Maybe you will find it's more like starting at 3rd level, instead of 1st level. However, improvements allow players to shape their character's advancement more than in D&amp;D, where if you don't have spells, the kinds of powers you have are often dependent on what magical items the GM puts in the dungeon.<br/><br/>3. The rules cater to different specific pieces of fiction. If you make a move, you roll. If you do something else, the GM just decides what happens (although DW says a GM move is "roll on a random table"), which pushes players towards making those moves. That might clash with the "emergent story" or you might find it guides the game towards certain desired actions. Since you like AW already, if that's the kind of stuff you want to encourage players to do in D&amp;D as well, then you'll probably like using those rules. Different hacks have different moves, though, so check each one.<br/><br/>4. Play tends to move faster, especially combat. Having played B/X D&amp;D and my World of Algol hack (which uses the basic AW rules) with the same (Red Box Vancouver) players, I definitely found the AW combats were over almost in a flash, and were much more dynamic, than the usual back-and-forth of D&amp;D. Sometimes that back-and-forth can build up a lot of cool tension, but sometimes it just drags.<br/><br/>5. As to the logistics of treasure, I found AW's abstract barter system actually freed me up to describe different sorts of treasures, which I could then assign a barter value to, instead of the ubiquitous, undifferentiated gold and silver coins all over the place. You can still have a coin horde worth x-barter that weighs several hundred pounds that the players need to figure out how to move, of course, but you won't get the same granularity that you get keeping track of every single coin and every single purchase.<br/><br/>Various D&amp;D-themed Apocalypse World hacks:<br/><br/><a href="http://redmoosegames.blogspot.com/2010/08/johnstone-metzger-on-playing-aw-sword.html" rel="nofollow">The most basic hack ever.</a><br/>(with apologies for the self-aggrandizement)<br/><br/>The original AD&amp;D/AW mash-up, <a href="http://planet-thirteen.com/apocd&amp;d/ApocalypseD&amp;D3.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">Tony Dowler's Apocalypse D&amp;D.</a><br/>And some of that stuff also appears in Tony's old-school D&amp;D module, <a href="http://planet-thirteen.com/Purple.html" rel="nofollow">The Purple Worm Graveyard.</a><br/><br/>Dungeon World Hack, the free version of DW is available at <a href="http://www.dungeon-world.com/index.php/downloads/" rel="nofollow">this page here</a> (scroll down).<br/><br/>And my Planet Algol/AW mash up, <a href="http://johnstone.wikispaces.com/file/view/world_of_algol_landscape_20110624.pdf/239873665/world_of_algol_landscape_20110624.pdf" rel="nofollow">World of Algol.</a><br/>(and the <a href="http://johnstone.wikispaces.com/file/view/world_of_algol_1_sheets_20110705.pdf/240098023/world_of_algol_1_sheets_20110705.pdf" rel="nofollow">character sheets</a>)<br/><br/><br/>As to the question, why should you play Dungeon World specifically instead of another hack?

Greed is king, and all characters are thieves (or at least scavengers). You don't get xp for rescuing the princess, you don't get xp for slaying the dragon. If you can get in and get out with the dragon's gold, it can eat the princess and you can still get all the xp available. Some of us think this is a good thing, though! Only scoundrels and madmen go into dungeons! Some people use the term "murderhobo," and it is true that you can't make gp=xp characters very heroic. Even if they get xp for monetary rewards, they're still saving the princess in exchange for money. Monster-slayers can at least be portrayed as saving innocent people from horrible monsters, but in the end they are also murderhoboes, because they get xp for murdering stuff, and thieves don't have to be murderers.<br/><br/>2. Encourages exploration over confrontation. You get crap xp for low-HD monsters, even if they are super-deadly, and treasure won't come looking for you. So you have to find ways to search every corner of the dungeon while avoiding the monsters you don't absolutely have to fight. Once you have a bunch of treasure, you want to get the hell out of the dungeon before you get ambushed and lose it all (along with lives). Or, you might be mentally doing the math and realizing you need just a little more treasure for everybody to level up, so you take a risk and check a few more rooms. Maybe you get lucky and there is treasure, maybe you get monsters and you die or you have to run like crazy. Because it really sucks fighting monsters, especially wandering monsters who have no treasure. If you get xp for monsters, you love to find monsters, because then you can kill them! Which is a bit weird, don't you think? Monsters should be scary bastards who allatime fuck you over.<br/><br/>3. And yes, backstabbing. In some rules, surviving retainers get a share of xp, even if you don't pay them, which encourages you to let them die in the dungeon. In some other games, you only get xp for the treasure that you get to keep after the adventure. So it's possible to divide it up unfairly but so characters of different levels can level up, but it also means you probably argue over how the loot gets divided, and thieves might steal from other characters or conceal certain pieces of loot.<br/><br/>So you can no doubt see how this is different from xp for monsters.<br/><br/>Both of those systems differ from AW's xp-for-using-stats in that there's a lot more room for useless (in terms of advancement) action in D&amp;D. As long as you use the moves in AW, you will advance, no matter what you are trying to do or where your character is in actually achieving goals in the fiction. Which is probably why AW encourages aggressive scene framing, so you only play out what is important. If you play a dungeon-crawl within the bounds of old-school play, but with AW advancement, you can end up with a situation where bumbling adventurers repeatedly fail to obtain treasure, escape from humiliating (but not deadly) traps, and spend most of their time running away from monsters can then exit the dungeon having gained numerous advances and stat increases.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D, that same activity nets no xp. The dungeon (a gp=xp dungeon) has a certain amount of treasure built into it from the start, and that's how much xp you can get out of it. How long it takes you to get it (and how many characters) is up to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354383/#Comment_354383" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-15T17:33:58+00:00" title="January 15, 2012  5:33PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2012 5:34PM by mease19.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dig.

So you go into a dungeon and collect treasure. You don't get XP: you get the XP when you go back to the town and spend the wealth to advance yourself in the world.<br/><br/>This makes particular sense when the advancement system includes things like becoming a Lord, building your own Keep, or attracting followers and henchmen. This is why you go on adventures: you want to become rich, to move up--to advance--in the world.<br/><br/>It makes a lot more sense in the context of an actual dungeon, too, since the player and the character have somewhat the same motivation and the same way of thinking:<br/><br/>"I want to go into the dungeon to get the wealth no one else has been brave enough or smart enough to find. I also want to make sure I get out alive!"<br/><br/>So it indirectly encourages problem solving and clever approaches to problems. If you see a chest of gold guarded by some incredibly beastly monster, XP for defeating monsters says: "I want to go into a fair fight with that monstrosity, so I can get experience!" Whereas XP for gold says: "Oh, man! That thing is scary. How can I find a way to get the treasure and get out without that thing hurting me too much? Can I trick it? Scare it away? Find some way to kill it that's hopefully less dangerous than just going toe-to-toe with it?"<br/><br/>Which mode of thinking seems more "realistic", more likely for a treasure hunter? It certainly encourages more problem solving and lateral thinking, which can be fun. Combat is something to be *avoided*, an unfortunate consequence of insufficient planning...<br/><br/>If your game is heroic fantasy, where the heroes want to kill the dragon to free the world from its menace, then, yeah, XP for treasure doesn't match as well, though.<br/><br/>As another nice side-effect, the DM in an XP-for-treasure game has no need to make sure monsters are "balanced" for the party: it's your job to decide whether you can take it on or not, suckers! (Whereas if leveling up could only be accomplished by killing monsters, your DM is kind of a jerk if she doesn't provide you with monsters suitable to your level -- too hard and you'll die, too easy and you won't get enough XP.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354391/#Comment_354391" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-15T18:13:21+00:00" title="January 15, 2012  6:13PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, one advantage gp/monsters=xp has over stat-use and goal-oriented xp is that it unifies the party.

Which works for AW, because it's supposed to support a certain amount of PvP.<br/><br/>Ivan, I don't know what Gary and Dave were trying to achieve with gp=xp. Tavis Allison and/or James Nostack from <i>The Mule Abides</i> blog would probably be my go-to guys if I wanted to know something like that, since I don't usually frequent D&amp;D forums, old-school or not. I do know that in some communities, like MIT gamers in the 70s, gp=xp was one of the first rules to get axed. Those guys used mostly goal- or quest-oriented xp with some for monsters and, like Marshall says, treasure being its own reward.

Combat is something to be *avoided*, an unfortunate consequence of insufficient planning...<br/><br/>If your game is heroic fantasy, where the heroes want to kill the dragon to free the world from its menace, then, yeah, XP for treasure doesn't match as well, though.<br/><br/>As another nice side-effect, the DM in an XP-for-treasure game has no need to make sure monsters are "balanced" for the party: it's your job to decide whether you can take it on or not, suckers! (Whereas if leveling up could only be accomplished by killing monsters, your DM is kind of a jerk if she doesn't provide you with monsters suitable to your level -- too hard and you'll die, too easy and you won't get enough XP.)</blockquote>\nYes. The spending-gold-to-get-XP thing was actually the rule in B/X, if I remember correctly, and is the best way of doing things for the reasons you give.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noisms" title="noisms"><img alt="noisms" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/download/file.php?avatar=7881_1233713790.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noisms">noisms</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354457/#Comment_354457" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-16T08:05:58+00:00" title="January 16, 2012  8:05AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite><br/>It was almost certainly the latter, I'm afraid.

Maybe there's an article in Dragon, or somewhere?<br/><br/>2e has optional rules that are similar, like receiving their xp "only when they have the opportunity to rest and tell others of their exploits. This means that characters collect experience when they return to their homes, stop at an inn, or the like." (DMG, p 48). And there's the Training optional rule (p 49) that says you can't level up until you pay for and receive training. There's a mention of different academies to train different classes, but you're still getting xp for gp recovered, not for the gp you spend on training. It's obviously included because people were already using it, so it's possible this is a variation of the xp-for-gp-spent, or that it evolved out of this optional rule.<br/><br/>I remember Blair mentioning the xp-for-gp-spent rule to me recently.

Tavis Allison and/or James Nostack from<i>The Mule Abides</i>blog would probably be my go-to guys if I wanted to know something like that, since I don't usually frequent D&amp;D forums, old-school or not. I do know that in some communities, like MIT gamers in the 70s, gp=xp was one of the first rules to get axed. Those guys used mostly goal- or quest-oriented xp with some for monsters and, like Marshall says, treasure being its own reward. It seems to be pretty universally loved amongst the OSR blogs.</blockquote>\nadamwb is correct; the proto-D&amp;D texts show a lot of activity around gp for XP. The number of variant rules out there suggest that it was an active focus of design, not just one of the leftovers from "a bad rule now is better than a perfect one later". To quickly summarize:<br/><br/>- In First Fantasy Campaign, Arneson says that the Blackmoor campaign started out with GP for recovering XP, but then very early on (i.e. in 1972 or 1973?) they decided it made more sense to give GP for spending XP. Many people in the OSR agree (my own play experience was much improved when we introduced this concept to the White Sandbox), although as far as I know no one actually uses the FFC "special interest" system as written, in which different classes get different amounts of XP for different activities; the concept is sound but the implementation is hard to follow.<br/><br/>- Dave Megarry might know how Arneson was doing experience at the time he showed Gygax how to play Blackmoor and gave him the original set of notes that got D&amp;D started. It seems likely that this set of notes was basically just charts, kind of like Arneson's DM screen, and that XP was a procedure that wasn't written down at that stage.<br/><br/>- If anyone knows what was in the first draft that Gygax wrote up based on Arneson's notes and his own play experiences (that one session with Arneson and Megarry and maybe some others, and then Gygax doing it himself with his kids and locals), I don't know about it.<br/><br/>- A manuscript that is likely to be Arneson's revisions of that draft exists in which only fighters get XP for GP. Magic-users get XP for casting spells, clerics get XP for good works. Whether this is Arneson correcting Gygax's misunderstandings of his original system, or providing updates to reflect the evolution of what he has decided works best in Blackmoor since then, is not clear. This manuscript includes lots of stuff that was not part of OD&amp;D as published.<br/><br/>- OD&amp;D (1974) has the rule that you get XP for recovering GP from the dungeon. It is implied that this is supposed to be the main driver of XP from adventuring, but analyses of the monster and treasure charts suggest that this is not necessarily true if you follow random dungeon stocking procedures. The examples of awarding XP in the OD&amp;D text are not only unclear but also do not match the text, further indicating that there was a lot of late-stage design work on XP going on in between these different manuscripts and playtest sessions.<br/><br/>- Gygax's Supplement I (1975) calls the XP awards from combat in OD&amp;D "ridiculous" and drastically cuts them down, making treasure more important. The vehemence of "ridiculous" seems out of place and is maybe part of an internal argument with Arneson, who we can imagine is by this point upset that OD&amp;D was rushed to press without the revisions and polish he added to his manuscript &amp; with a lot of design changes of which everyone getting XP for GP seems to be among the biggest.<br/><br/>- Almost everyone everywhere decides that XP from GP is ridiculous, breaking one of the fundamental drivers of the game (especially if Greyhawk reduced-XP-from-combat awards are used, it will now take forever to level) and leading to all manner of problems that don't arise from the rules as written (although arguably a more clear presentation of the XP rules or designer's notes about why they matter could have helped). <br/><br/>- "<a href="http://www.thedelversdungeon.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=59" rel="nofollow">Orgies, Inc.</a>" in Dragon <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2310&amp;Mode=like">#10</a> (1977) presents a system for gaining XP by spending it on class-specific functions that is simpler than Arneson's in First Fantasy Campaign and seems to have been independently derived.<br/><br/>- Moldvay's Basic (1981) explicitly says that the ratio of XP from gold to XP from combat should be 3:1, and does what he can within the legacy monster/treasure framework to devise dungeon stocking procedures that make it come out that way.<br/><br/>- Lots of OSR exploration of GP for XP recovered and/or spent takes place.<br/><br/>- Adventurer Conqueror King (2012) formalizes the ratio of 4:1 XP from treasure to combat that has been working for us in our campaigns, and designs new monster/treasure tables that allow the dungeon stocking procedure to achieve this result much more reliably than Moldvay (in which it works only at certain levels, and only if you kill dwarves and nobles on sight).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354649/#Comment_354649" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T08:15:39+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  8:15AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tavis</cite>that draft exists in which only fighters get XP for GP.

DM: "It would be cool if he did. What do you think would be a cool pet or familiar for him to have?" etc.).

Do you find that AW scratches a much different itch than D&amp;D, and if so which parts? I remember you posted about a sense of dramatic narrative vs. the verisimilitude of a setting (if I'm not re-interpreting your words too liberally). For me, I find scene framing is a big part of that -- I wouldn't want to play a dungeon crawl with a DM who thinks it's appropriate to cut scenes like he's Peter Jackson editing the Mines of Moria, the same way I don't want to play a Bourne Identity-style thriller where I have to play through all 24 hours of every day. I want to explore a dungeon in one and play thrilling espionage scenes in the other. But I find Vincent's basic approach to resolution works for either (the procedure of 1. thing happens in game fiction, 2. we roll dice, they tell us a result, 3. we interpret result back into the fiction and keep narrating).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354772/#Comment_354772" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T18:16:46+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  6:16PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2012 6:17PM by Tavis.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>HOLY SHIT TAVIS ARE YOU SAYING FIFTH EDITION D&amp;D WAS WRITTEN BY DAVE ARNESON?!?!?!!!!!!!!</blockquote>\nGary Gygax was fond of replying to people asking "what would your personal vision of 3rd edition be?" by saying it'd be a reprint of AD&amp;D, and even that had a proto-edition war attached to it (some people didn't want to convert from OD&amp;D).

The granularity of OD&amp;D as written - how far can your X-ray vision penetrate, how many wandering monster checks will elapse as you peer through each 10' of wall - seems perfectly suited for dungeon adventures, where numbers and distance provide their own rigor. It's loosey-goosey stuff like cities and carousing and wildernesses and mountain climbs where I really want the rigor that comes from a move's internal structure.<br/><br/>So for me AW and D&amp;D scratch itches that both come up in the course of a campaign; I like having each approach in my toolkit but admit to some perplexity as to how exactly you'd use AW to scratch the dungeoncrawly itch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354787/#Comment_354787" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T21:11:12+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  9:11PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2012 9:12PM by skinnyghost.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tavis</cite><br/><br/>So for me AW and D&amp;D scratch itches that both come up in the course of a campaign; I like having each approach in my toolkit but admit to some perplexity as to how exactly you'd use AW to scratch the dungeoncrawly itch.</blockquote>\nIt strikes me, here, as relevant to say that I don't think you would use them to scratch the same itch in the same way.  If I were to run a game of 10" x 10" room-style dungeon crawling, I'd probably use B/X to do it.  That said, there are games where I want to hand-wave away the nitpicky stuff and just say "let's have fun in a dungeon and not agonize over every little detail - let's focus on the story of the dungeon and the treasure and all our party hijinks" and that's what Dungeon World is for.<br/><br/>It's an important distinction to remember that, while there are loads of related elements between DW and AW, they're not the same game and, as such, some of the stuff that would seem undungeony have been excised. <br/><br/>The real core is, as Johnstone said, the "procedure of 1. thing happens in game fiction, 2. we roll dice, they tell us a result, 3. we interpret result back into the fiction and keep narrating" is fully intact and is there to play to groups who are less interested in the 5 foot tactical shuffle and more in the "what cool stuff happens to us, now?!" approach.  <br/><br/>I'd never suggest that Dungeon World replaces any sort of D&amp;D, whatever your edition, but that it provides a similar, if alternative, means to create the same fiction in the end.  The stories told after-the-fact sound just like the kind we'd tell about our 2nd Edition games (with Skills and Powers, no less *shudder*)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354789/#Comment_354789" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T21:50:50+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  9:50PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I hate <i>actually</i> playing any incarnation of D&amp;D, or similar (be it something like Palladium Fantasy or Burning Wheel.)<br/><br/>However, as Adam puts it, there is a way to get the same or similar fiction without all the '5 foot tactical shuffle.'

Do you find that AW scratches a much different itch than D&amp;D, and if so which parts? I remember you posted about a sense of dramatic narrative vs. the verisimilitude of a setting (if I'm not re-interpreting your words too liberally). For me, I find scene framing is a big part of that -- I wouldn't want to play a dungeon crawl with a DM who thinks it's appropriate to cut scenes like he's Peter Jackson editing the Mines of Moria, the same way I don't want to play a Bourne Identity-style thriller where I have to play through all 24 hours of every day. I want to explore a dungeon in one and play thrilling espionage scenes in the other. But I find Vincent's basic approach to resolution works for either (the procedure of 1. thing happens in game fiction, 2. we roll dice, they tell us a result, 3. we interpret result back into the fiction and keep narrating).</blockquote>\nNo, that's a good interpretation, and that summarises my own feelings on it. Sometimes you want "fantasy fucking Vietnam", as they say, in which every single decision <i>matters</i> and the players are held to account for all of their decisions, right down to when they run out of oil in their lamps or fail to notice an obvious trap and stupidly kill themselves in a horrible anticlimax. That scratches my "verisimilitude itch". And done right it's a really challenging, interesting <i>strategy game</i>.<br/><br/>But sometimes you want something more cinematic, like you say, and I like how Apocalypse World sort of forces events into a coherent narrative of a kind. When I've played it, it has felt almost like you could make the story into a TV miniseries. So that scratches the "drama itch".<br/><br/>I disagree that Vincent's basic approach works for either, and that's because there's always this notion of "game fiction" somewhere in his way of doing things, as you mention. Really, proper Old School D&amp;D, I would argue, isn't about "game fiction". You're <i>not</i> telling a story when you play it. You're playing a strategy game. It's a very complicated game with a highly developed set of very subjective rules and a varied set of objectives, but a strategy game nonetheless. The player characters are really just avatars for the players, and the DM is a referee. This doesn't mean that it doesn't sort of fit together like a story gradually, but that's all a relatively unconscious emergent process. Once the campaign is over you can look back at it and see it had a narrative strand of a kind, because the way the game works it can't help but become a story if you want to see it that way, but that's all retrospective. <br/><br/>This is why early D&amp;D bangs on so much about playing the game well, and they didn't mean role playing your character well or telling a good story. They were talking about actual player skill: solving puzzles, figuring out how to get past obstacles, memorising the right spells, etc. This is why you get XP for treasure, and not for telling a good story or acting like an elf convincingly.<br/><br/><b>More generally</b> I think there are benefits to cross-pollenisation, as I've said. And I like both D&amp;D and AW. But fundamentally I wonder whether Dungeon World will do something very different to what D&amp;D does, because it's not really a strategy game at its core. (Which isn't to say for a second it won't be fun and interesting.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354845/#Comment_354845" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-18T11:10:44+00:00" title="January 18, 2012 11:10AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that maybe DW as is doesn't quite do that.

However, my World of Algol hack uses the stats and moves right out of Apocalypse World and I've run old-school style dungeon crawl sessions with it quite successfully.<br/><br/>Take a situation from the last Red Box Vancouver game: Graham is playing Holga, a magic-user who worships the Purple Worm God. Another PC, Ranndy Serpenthelm, has been transformed into an enchanted minotaur by a magic amulet (which makes him an NPC). While the minotaur is eating some dogs, Holga turns invisible and tries to stuff a potion of gaseous form into the minotaur's throat. So, what happens?<br/><br/>If we had been using the Apocalypse World rules, I would have a total of two options, by my reckoning. The only move that could possibly apply here is acing under fire. So, I could say "roll+cool to act under fire, and the fire is that the minotaur is able to get violent with you, invisible or not." Then we would go to the move, it would return a verdict of success, fail, or success with consequences, and I (with Graham) would interpret what that looks like in the fiction. My other option would be to just decide what happens without rolling any dice.<br/><br/>(I suppose I could technically write a new move on the spot, "when you stuff something into a minotaur's mouth..." but it's usually better to have your custom moves written before you start the session, I find.)<br/><br/>Since we were playing B/X, I had more options. I could have used the rules on page B60, and said, "You have a 60% chance of succeeding," or "roll your Dex or less on a d20 to succeed." Either of these rules is exactly the same as acting under fire except there is no success with consequences result, just success and failure. I could also make up a new rule, or borrow a house rule from outside of B/X. Or I could also just decide what happens. In this case because the game also tells me to reward clever actions, I simply decided it succeeded, partly because Holga was invisible and can wait for the right moment, and partly because she still had to save vs. spells to avoid the amulet's curse herself if she was going to save Ranndy (a 30% chance, as it turns out, which Graham managed to succeed at -- and that is how the Purple Worm God saved it's cultists from the minotaur trap).<br/><br/>Most situations I found worked like that, basically the same in either game. There is the case that on a miss with the AW rules, the MC makes a hard move, which can be to deplete the PCs' resources, but when the players didn't know how many charges they had in their laser guns to begin with, from their perspective there would be little difference if I had kept track of it secretly or whether I decided the gun ran out when they failed a roll. Logistics they DID know about, they had to deal with in the same manner -- as if they were these fictional people in this situation and had to decide what they were going to do with the stuff they had.<br/><br/>I did notice a difference in combat, which goes faster using the AW rules. When you fight with swords in AW, you roll to seize by force, and probably somebody will be dead or seriously wounded after that one roll. Now in D&amp;D, the process of going to the rules from the fiction -- i.e. rolling to hit -- is the same, just without the 7-9 mixed results. But when we get to damage, it can turn into simply trading numbers back and forth, until somebody reaches zero, and we neglect to describe much of the actual fiction. Or, we describe what happens but it's just colour. I notice that (Planet Algol) Blair likes to ham up the horrible effects of wounds more than I do, but neither of us are concerned with the actual in-fiction consequences of say, an infection because of a bite on the leg, unless the wound is very serious like a broken arm. You lose a few hit points, you keep going, you leave the dungeon, you heal up, you go back in. But, essentially, we don't always go back to the fiction in between rolls to hit and damage in D&amp;D, partly because it's a longer process than in AW.<br/><br/>The main difference there is that AW moves are all standardized, most involve rolling, and the actual tracking of inventories is deliberately abstracted. So you might not run out of ammo until the MC says you run out of ammo -- although Graham's character in World of Algol, a Polish guy from WWII, came to Planet Algol with only two clips of ammunition for his handgun. In that case it was something to be aware of (or would have been, if he hadn't lost the gun before his ammo ran out), but even then I don't like tracking individual bullets because it assumes absolutely perfect fire discipline on the part of the character.<br/><br/>Additionally, just because the seven basic moves in AW lean towards certain types of behaviours, doesn't mean that D&amp;D's rules don't. The top-down approach Vincent took in deciding what behaviours would be encouraged results in more-or-less the same situation as D&amp;D's collection of rules for things that players often did in games. AW has rules for reading people, manipulating people, going aggro on them, and opening your brain to the psychic maelstrom. D&amp;D has rules for fighting, finding secret doors, determining monster reactions and morale, and casting spells. Neither has a concrete rule for stuffing a potion down a minotaur's throat when it can't see you. Any player who has read the rules may still think "oh, I can do anything I can think of," but they will also be thinking about the actions described in the rules, and be encouraged to take those actions, knowing there are rules there to support them doing so.<br/><br/>(tl; dr?) So that's a long-winded way of saying that, in my experience, the resolution part of the game is not what creates the divide between experiencing the fiction as a coherent story versus experiencing it as a coherent environment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Curious About Dungeon World Yet

Some games deal with that directly and explicitly ('Shock:' fr'ex) while others don't deal with it at all (most board games, fr'ex). <br/><br/>However, experiencing a coherent environment requires prep (or, maybe just extremely quick thinking and a stone face.) There are no setting books for Apocalypse World, and while the setting is built during play, it's secondary qua the Players. Whereas, in Dungeon and Dragons, because of the pre-determined character of dungeons, environments and settings, the Players have to deal with it as is, and often has the quality of running into a concrete wall. Fr'ex, if there's a puzzle-trap in AW as a result of a role, the MC can just ask how the character solves it or knows the solution: "I've dealt with Sand Mutants before, they always use the same snares." In D&amp;D however, the trap is what is it is. While the party might come up with a clever solution to solving it, that solution is always heavy constrained by the specific details of the puzzle-trap. Fr'ex, touching the pressure plate with a ten-foot pole. But if that puzzle-trap says range 20ft, then the party is still effected. <br/><br/>If setting is largely indeterminate, then the Players actions and Move/Abilities will determine the fiction. However, if the setting is largely pre-determined, it will heavily constrain the the actions and outcomes of the Players.<br/><br/>You'll see this distinction clearly in play if the GM has a pre-made map or not. Without a map, scenes are framed following from some idea of a narrative. With map, they're framed with respect to the specific environment. This actually one of the major way that Dogs or IAWA is different from AW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354892/#Comment_354892" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-18T15:12:52+00:00" title="January 18, 2012  3:12PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could also probably say why I liked using the AW rules for a Planet Algol dungeon crawl. These are some reasons you might want to mix these games, or reasons you might NOT want to if you don't like the same stuff I do:<br/><br/>1. I like some of the moves. Occasionally, in B/X, a player will ask "can I tell if he's lying to me?" and I'll let him roll to read a person with his wisdom modifier. There's some D&amp;D-specific ones that are missing, but I can probably write or adapt those without too much hassle.<br/><br/>2. Combat is faster. See my post above. Also I like the lower hit points thing.<br/><br/>3. I like how money is abstracted, actually. Standardized coins really doesn't do much for me, but in World of Algol, I could just describe a piece of treasure, like "it's a statue, looks valuable, maybe x-barter, maybe four hundred pounds." And that's that. Or I could describe a coin hoard with various different sizes of gold and silver coins and some gems and just ballpark how valuable the total is. Then I let the players decide how they are going to truck it back to civilization. It felt like they were finding unique treasures, instead of just picking up money off the ground (which I find logistically satisfying as a D&amp;D player because I am greedy, but isn't exciting as a piece of fiction). Mostly, I want to get right into what the players are going to propose to solve their problem and not worry about exact numbers. If they're clever and creative, I feel like I should be lenient, if they do something stupid I should be strict.<br/><br/>4. I like how PCs have special moves and improvements. The special moves make characters unique, add some flavour, but aren't overly complicated like feats and 4E powers (at least I find those things overly complicated). And you actually start with less individual special powers than a B/X thief! I also like how improvements let players define things about their characters. In D&amp;D, your 8th level fighter's capabilities are mostly dependent on what magical items the DM puts in the dungeon for you to find. You get to decide what your 9th level castle looks like, but little else. The magic-use at least mght be able to pick new spells. In AW, you can use an improvement to get a gang, and hey, now you have a gang without having to role-play the whole recruitment process. And if you get them all killed, they don't magically come back just because you spent an improvement once -- you get the one gang and that's it.<br/><br/>5. Finally, AW encourages certain DM behaviours that I want to do more of. In particular, it says to give the PCs the benefit of the doubt -- if they can do something, cool, don't try and make individual tasks harder to accomplish as a way of giving the players a challenge. Let them do stuff, then let them deal with the consequences of their actions. Complex, multi-stage goals can still be difficult, it's avoiding the consequences that is hard.<br/><br/>So for example, what if the PCs run into Orcus on Planet Algol. One of the players says he wants to open his brain to the psychic maelstrom and read orcus' mind. I might ask how he does that, and maybe he says that he's been describing how his character interacts with the maelstrom as like telepathy with spirits. Orcus is an extra-planar being, so this player thinks it is reasonable he can read Orcus' mind.<br/><br/>Some DMs might impose their own definition of the psychic maelstrom and say "no it doesn't work like that," (which is boring), or they might decide that no, Orcus has psychic shields and there's no way a mere mortal could get into his mind (also boring). But AW always reminds me that since the player thinks it is reasonable, why shouldn't I agree? So, I would say "sure, roll to open your mind, if you get a hit, I will tell you all of Orcus' secrets, either in vague detail or precise detail!" And then after the player has rolled I will say "so, Orcus is a death god from the deepest pits of hell and you are inside his mind. How, exactly, do you propose to stay sane?" Ha! Tricked you stupid player! You thought it would be so easy and you'd get off scott free, well... one out of two isn't bad, right?<br/><br/>So, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a> isn't unique to AW by any means, and probably a lot of people who have never played it already play that way (although that's just the most prominent example, there's other stuff too). It's just nice to have a reminder there to not just run the game any old way that is comfortable, but to run it in a specific way, when that specific way contains elements I want to get better at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354894/#Comment_354894" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-18T15:24:31+00:00" title="January 18, 2012  3:24PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2012 3:25PM by Johnstone.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But even if you find Dungeon World to be a romp through fantasy and dungeoneering tropes with the feel of AW and you ultimately decide you can't use any of it for old school play, well, I tried.

Speaking of which, I've made coinage into 'Treasure' in my DW games, which works just like Barter in AW and has been smooth and simple in its implementation. I really like the way AW has spawned all of these awesome hacks via encouragement, and in turn they have been hacked to suit each groups individual needs.

The GM has a responsibility to present the world authentically (this gets phrased slightly differently in AW and DW, but it's in the agenda for both).<br/><br/>Johnstone's example is one where, as the full example shows, there's a precedent for why he'd say "oh yeah, sure, you can do that." The player's already done the creative thinking to find a cool solution. In another situation, one where a player says "I call on my god to smite him!" the GM isn't obliged to say "well, okay, your god smites him, you win!" The GM is presenting an authentic world, one where (in Dungeon World) the gods give you small rewards, related to their domains, for your piety, they don't step down and smite.<br/><br/>So I'd encourage you to consider *W anyway, it is completely in line with "it doesn't work like that" not being boring. In fact, it's a game that specifically tells you to say "it doesn't work like that" (via your agenda) when that is part of authentically presenting the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354966/#Comment_354966" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T10:33:27+00:00" title="January 19, 2012 10:33AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, what Sage says is totally true of AW as well.

One of the core principles is <i>Make AW seem real</i> and that often involves things being what they are and the players having to use moves and stuff-that's-not-moves (i.e. fictonal positioning) to deal with it. In order to lead with the fiction, it has to actually mean something, having a relatively fixed nature. Otherwise, it's just color and doesn't provide the characters or the MC with any leverage to make their moves.  Sure, things can change or end up not being what you expected, or maybe some things are open ended because you haven't decided or established exactly what they're like yet, but there has to be some <i>there</i> there, otherwise things fall flat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354982/#Comment_354982" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T12:03:03+00:00" title="January 19, 2012 12:03PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2012 12:06PM by Johnstone.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zak, that's a good point.<br/><br/>I don't mean <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a> to apply directly to specific, deliberate puzzles presented by the DM. I will admit that I'm not very enthusiastic when a DM presents a puzzle that has a specific solution the DM has already devised and that's the only way to solve the puzzle, but even in those cases, that's a thing, and if you're playing the game, you play the game.<br/><br/>So, if we return to my example of the minotaur puzzle, above, there was some stuff that didn't work before what I described. A first-level character tried to grapple the minotaur, thinking that was a good idea until the rest of the party fled to safety. The minotaur gored him to death. Likewise, if Holga the magic-user had tried to cast sleep on the minotaur, it would not have worked (which Graham already knew). So yeah, if it doesn't work, it doesn't work, that's fine. Or, in the case of grappling, we have already decided and agreed on which rules we are using (Flame Princess), and so we used them, and the dice said no.<br/><br/>But then Graham/Holga used Invisibility to force the potion of gaseous form into the minotaur, which meant it couldn't attack (being gaseous). Graham was also hoping the amulet wold fall off, but it was cursed so it didn't but Holga was able to grab it (the minotaur being gaseous). Which meant a save vs. turning into the cursed minotaur. All that is dealing with the minotaur puzzle. Should I have required a roll to sneak up on the minotaur, even though Holga's invisible and the minotaur is busy eating? Should I have required a roll to get the potion down the minotaur's throat (even though lotsa stuff is already going down it)? To me, calling for those rolls seems like I'm making the player deal with his character's incompetence in addition to the puzzle, and I don't feel like that's the game the two of us agreed to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355032/#Comment_355032" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T15:22:34+00:00" title="January 19, 2012  3:22PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @johnstone<br/>\n<br/>\nit's a complicated question, and I appreciate that you're thinking on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, a big part of the "you can't do it" thing in regular old D&amp;D is that you are not only trying to make problem-solving interesting (and hard--though not necessarily single-solution) but you are also trying to make leveling up mean something and be a real goal.<br/>\n<br/>\ni think there is a genuine case that regular D&amp;D (all versions) should be replaced with some other variant for one-shots.

I figure most of them have run D&amp;D a lot more than I have and they balanced risk/reward adequately. Usually it works pretty good for the episodic play we usually do.<br/>b) I put greater rewards behind a greater <i>number</i> of obstacles, so that I don't have to deal with the difficulty, necessarily.<br/><br/>But I do think the advancement system in AW is totally inappropriate to challenging exploration. While it's definitely a different thing than levels, you can do the equivalent of gaining a level every 3 or 4 hour session, sometimes faster, and it's not at all dependent on achieving goals. Considering we spent four sessions on a fortress that I had intended to get the PCs the equivalent of one level if they looted the fuck out of it, they were way too advanced at the end of it.<br/><br/>This, I think, is where most of the work lies in using AW tools in an old school exploration style, unless you're just borrowing a move or two to use as house rules.<br/><br/>As to the crappy thief,<br/>I know, right? Fuckin' thieves, man! You could play a one-shot at level 6+, although then everybody is high level for everything. Because I often play with only 3 or 4 players total, I had thought it might be fun to play the Flame Princess without specialists, with everybody getting specialist skills. Then you could be a fighter with stealth 5 at first level, and get better at backstab, lockpicking, and search as you leveled up, or something. Dunno if that would solve the issue for you or not though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355047/#Comment_355047" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T19:27:13+00:00" title="January 19, 2012  7:27PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            well i don't have an issue, i'm just explaining that the "ok, you just can't do that" in old school D&amp;D is not the huge funstopping fail that it might seem to some SGers                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355049/#Comment_355049" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T19:28:18+00:00" title="January 19, 2012  7:28PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            also, from what i'm hearing, DW seems like it might be a good one-shot D&amp;D system                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355069/#Comment_355069" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T23:09:33+00:00" title="January 19, 2012 11:09PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            DW works awesome as a one shot, either by using an existing module or one of Marshall's excellent dungeon starters.

There are no setting books for Apocalypse World, and while the setting is built during play, it's secondary qua the Players. Whereas, in Dungeon and Dragons, because of the pre-determined character of dungeons, environments and settings, the Players have to deal with it as is, and often has the quality of running into a concrete wall. Fr'ex, if there's a puzzle-trap in AW as a result of a role, the MC can just ask how the character solves it or knows the solution: "I've dealt with Sand Mutants before, they always use the same snares." In D&amp;D however, the trap is what is it is. While the party might come up with a clever solution to solving it, that solution is always heavy constrained by the specific details of the puzzle-trap.

When the players' actions are constrained, they have to think hard about how to do things. They have to brainstorm and come up with solutions. And when they overcome an obstacle, they feel like they really have overcome an obstacle. <br/><br/>It's very 'gamist', but also in its own way very immersive, because the players invest a lot in this problem-solving aspect of the game, just as their in-game characters probably would.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355107/#Comment_355107" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-20T10:13:20+00:00" title="January 20, 2012 10:13AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>also, from what i'm hearing, DW seems like it might be a good one-shot D&amp;D system</blockquote>\nIt does great one-shots indeed, but there are some cool things that come into play in the long term that are totally worth exploring.

(For instance, in case <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, the GM will often give reasonably broad hints that something is up. "Well, that would normally work, but for some reason it's not.") Both S-Gers and OSR-ers agree that <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> is dumb, that the GM shouldn't become attached to his NPCs or emotionally invested in particular outcomes. In the case of "Orcus mind-reading" above, I think a plausible case could be made for the GM to simply say "no" on sincere reason <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> grounds. But, it's not, like, totally unthinkable that Orcus would let you read his mind in order to drive you insane. I could see an OSR GM, say Tavis, making the same call as Johnstone.<br/><br/>In other words, while there are profound differences between, broadly speaking, S-G and OSR, I don't actually think this issue is one of them, most of the time. On the other hand, Zak isn't wrong\u2014I think GMs saying "no" is a huge funstopping fail for a lot of members of the S-G community, simply because we've encountered case <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> far too often, or have been in situations where the line between cases really wasn't clear.<br/><br/>But reasonable and sincere "no"s on the part of the GM are well-supported by both the letter and general principles of the rules of all the major indie darlings that have a GM\u2014Dogs, BW/MG, AW.<br/><br/>I also want to point out that DW requires prep and maps and all that stuff.

He said, "if the rules don't explicitly forbid it, it's allowed" which in actual play was more like, "if the rules don't explicitly forbid it, you can present your case why it can work and I will act as a neutral referee in passing judgement" which ended up being very Dungeon World like, instead of "you can't" it was often "how?"

Although you probably will want some sort of generic, all encompassing Move to cover situations that aren't explicit. State your goal and to describe how you try to accomplish it... have your character actually do it before you know if it has any chance of success or what the cost of failure is. The DM then tells you it doesn't work (and may respond with a DM move) or tells you which Stat to roll. 10+ you do it. 7-9 you do it but with a cost or consequence. 6- you don't and something bad may happen (but doesn't have to, depends on the fictional situation).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355322/#Comment_355322" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-22T11:31:19+00:00" title="January 22, 2012 11:31AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2012 11:32AM by Hans_c-o.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>The DM then tells you it doesn't work (and may respond with a DM move) or tells you which Stat to roll.</blockquote>\nBut this isn't how DW is written, right?

We're not looking for the one ultimate game we can play forever (but there's nothing wrong with that!) -- we want to play the field, so to speak. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355337/#Comment_355337" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-22T13:52:11+00:00" title="January 22, 2012  1:52PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I think we're saying the same thing, you just laid it out much clearer.

Or at least, not only this.<br/><br/>Lots of people on the Story Games forums are:<br/><br/>- also part of the OSR. Many of us play the same games. <br/>- unaware of Forge Big Model theory.<br/>- people who've never played D&amp;D (or earlier versions of D&amp;D).<br/>- GMs who had difficulty with games (not just players who had bad GMs).<br/>- people who loved D&amp;D but had trouble fitting it into their schedules the way they enjoy playing/running D&amp;D.<br/><br/>As well as people who played D&amp;D, had a bad time but felt there was something to this RPG thing. But even among these people, just because they didn't enjoy D&amp;D doesn't say anything about those people who do enjoy D&amp;D. Fun is subjective. <br/><br/>I believe Ron Edwards game Sorcerer was a reaction to Champions rather than D&amp;D. Of course one could argue that Champions is connected to D&amp;D or that people on Story Games who have never played D&amp;D and know nothing about the Forge Big Model are still influenced by them because they play games that were influenced by games that were influence by other games tied to these sources. But at some point the connections grow thin. <br/><br/>I believe the partial origins of the Story Games community is Andy (the forum owner) simply wanting a place that was less serious than the Forge but not as chaotic as RPG.net. It's a middle ground of sorts for people with a diversity of interests and play styles. Usually when someone new comes to Story Games with a post like, "I\u2019m so glad I found this place, D&amp;D sucks" they are told that's not what we are about.<br/><br/>That all said, I don\u2019t think it is completely accurate to say that the OSR is full of people who played D&amp;D, had fun, and kept doing it. It's mostly true! But most of the OSR folks I know (and I know a lot, several of the communities I've organized spawned communities dedicated to the OSR) have parts of D&amp;D they had problems with in play and created their own hacks, patches, or D&amp;D clones. In many ways the Story Games and OSR communities aren't dissimilar in that respect. We all love this roleplaying thing and many of us tinker to make it fit our personal needs when we encounter parts that don't work for us. Which isn't the same as saying a game is broken or bad. Just that we have different needs. I'd offer that much of RPG culture is a form of hacking culture. After all, a lot of early RPGs were hacks of wargames that the designers found problematic or simply lacking in some way. I don't think this is unique to Story Games. <br/><br/>Here is where I (in my opinion) think you are on to something\u2026<br/><br/>A lot of Forge gaming theory has less to do with problematic GMs or problematic rules and more to do with clashes of expectations, goals, and poor communication. The mantra quoted is often variations of "play with people who want the same things" and "system matters", choose the system that best matches your interests. But by system they don't just mean rules but everything you do at the gaming table. This is partially why setting expectations and clear communication are so prized at the Forge.  If I wanted to be more cynical, I might argue that by saying system matters, you also create opportunity to build multiple systems, and sell stuff. I don't think that is the case.  I absolutely hate it when people try to convince others they have a problem they don't have just to sell them something. <br/><br/>But the problem in my opinion is that life isn't always easy or ideal. Most gamers play games to do something with friends, rather than making friends to play specific games. So groups will be diverse and have potentially conflicting interests. I love the idea of playing focused game and I'm fortunate to have a very large pool of players to find the right people for the right game (I helped create a non-profit that reaches over a 1,000 local gamers partially for this purpose). But in practice, for most people I know, compromise is the reality and focused play is an ideal not always met. What I like about focused games is it makes buy in and setting expectations easier than playing something that is more ambiguous. But the idea that you should stop playing with your friends if they don't want the same thing as you seems a bit heavy handed.<br/><br/>I don't think people here or in the OSR quite fall into distinct groups. There is incredible overlap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355348/#Comment_355348" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-22T15:28:35+00:00" title="January 22, 2012  3:28PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            well if you wanna be all conscientious and painstakingly detailed about it, sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355349/#Comment_355349" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-22T15:34:51+00:00" title="January 22, 2012  3:34PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br/>I believe the partial origins of the Story Games community is Andy (the forum owner) simply wanting a place that was less serious than the Forge but not as chaotic as RPG.net.

Yes Matt, I agree that the Fronts and Danger model is a wonderfully structured means of generating focused prottagonism, but you can still play DW as very much emergent play, based on very little prep other than some daydreaming about fantasy stuff, and some group co-authoring using the moves as 'prompts' to the cause and effect of the conversation at the table and thus the resultant fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nZak.... I think that that OSR has its own charms that endear players (from the original grognards to newer converts). What DW does for me is tap into the childhood joy of playing OSR at 10 years old, full of the 'story', that subsequent editions seemed to leech out of our play.  Its not that 3e or 4e isn't fun, its just not the sort of fun that I'd rather play. <br/>\n<br/>\nDW (and AW) give specific guidance on how to play and run the game, integrated by the mechanics. Which is great! Whereas OSR left that largely to the individual group, having so much 'wriggle-room' that we had favoured DMs and playing groups, based on their 'vision' of the ruleset. Plus there was no burgeoning online community full of inspirational art, downloadable content, handing out advice on 'the right way' to play. Playing was the enjoyment. Play that game, night after night, lunch time after lunch time, every spare minute in 'prep' making dungeons, creating awesome villians, designing fiendish traps, populating your own world with monsters and antagonism for the players. We all rotated being the DM, we all contributed to our story, we collaborated on inspirational protagonists, world design, monsters, magical expressions, maps, illustrations. We were the creators of our game, since all we had was this small set of guidelines to work with. (This was country Australia in the early 80's!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSG 'style' of games is just a preference, and one that is increasingly being hardwired into the mechanics of the games. This is exciting and supportive to those of us that enjoy this style of play. DW has done a rather neat trick of capturing the OSR tropes of a slim ruleset, evocative (and streamlined) B&amp;W graphic presentation, quickly structured protagonist development, exploration (fictional, geographical and personal), monster slaying and treasure collection supported by a design that rewards engaging both fictionally and mechanically with the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn't mean that it is the 'best' way of capturing these elements, it just happens to scratch both itches rather well. :)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355372/#Comment_355372" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-22T18:21:18+00:00" title="January 22, 2012  6:21PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2012 6:23PM by Tavis.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Noofy</cite>What DW does for me is tap into the childhood joy of playing OSR at 10 years old, full of the 'story', that subsequent editions seemed to leech out of our play.</blockquote>\nNoofy, what you're talking about there is old-school play: how it was actually done back in the day. The R in OSR usually stands for Old-School Renaissance, with the implicit idea of re-discovering something that's lost. <br/><br/>I bring this up not just to be pedantic - although fanatic Talmudic scholarship of the original texts and palimpsests is certainly part of the appeal of the OSR to me - but because it speaks to Zak's point. Although I started playing D&amp;D in 1980, my own experiences back in the day weren't much like the way I play the same rules today. Back then I was very into the idea that as DM it was my duty and privilege to author a grand story for the players to experience, which predictably caused frustration for all involved. But the reason that Dragonlance et al. were big sellers back in the day was that lots of people wanted this! <br/><br/>It's easier to talk about the OSR because (as cacophonously divergent as it often is) it is still a style of play people can choose from a range of alternatives, and that has lots of widely-heard advocates. Like Forge-style games, it shows some people how to do a particular thing they like and helps them identify exactly what it is that they like. <br/><br/>My experience is that folks who are just doing what they've been doing with old-timey D&amp;D all along don't often have much in common with the OSR; they weren't self-selecting into one of a range of alternatives, they descend from a chronological slice of trying to use D&amp;D to do everything there was! And folks who've been doing the same thing all along are hard to find precisely because lots of old-school D&amp;D players often jumped ship when another game came along specifically to do that thing; they became 3e players because their AD&amp;D houserules had been all about minis and tactical grid options, or they went over to the World of Darkness because their D&amp;D games had been all about metaplot and interpersonal drama. <br/><br/>Noofy, it sounds like your back in the day games were like what the OSR celebrates, and guys like Finarvyn at the OD&amp;D boards never had an "aha" moment, they'd been doing it all along. For me, though, there was a real process of revelation and guidance to figure out what I wanted to get out of D&amp;D that had been lost from my style or never been there at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355381/#Comment_355381" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-22T20:01:38+00:00" title="January 22, 2012  8:01PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I discovered the OSR through Storygames and now after playing LL and LotFP and reading OSR blogs, OSR is really starting to become one of my favorite play style. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355403/#Comment_355403" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T00:35:34+00:00" title="January 23, 2012 12:35AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played tons of D&amp;D and had massive amounts of fun, as well as games that fizzled.

It might contain some tricks and traps and monster stuff but it might not, that might be on the nebulous end of prep, depending on the GM.  <br/><br/>Personally, I tend to be fairly "traditional" about my dungeon / campaign / whatever preparation with Dungeon World.  Loads of maps (some empty rooms, some detailed exactly) and notes and junk because I tend to have a harder time coming up with stuff on the fly that I absolutely love right out the gate.  Other GMs may play it differently.  I think that DW allows either style of play without too much trouble.<br/><br/>Also, to pitch in my two cents on the "people on SG have had bad D&amp;D experiences" - we didn't write (at least, I didn't) Dungeon World to "fix" what we perceived as problems in Dungeons and Dragons Style play.  DW is an homage to the stories we tell about those sessions we played.  We've separated the game from the rules in an effort to, for people who want to play a certain way, allow the creation of the same stories that a B/X or AD&amp;D or whatever game might create.  I've been playing a ton of various editions of Dungeons and Dragons in parallel with DW - they scratch certain itches but I'd definitely say that most of my experiences in all the various forms of D&amp;D or D&amp;D-style rulesets have been positive.  <br/><br/>I think if I'd had less fun with them, Dungeon World would have ended up being Vampire World or Shadowrun World instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noisms" title="noisms"><img alt="noisms" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/download/file.php?avatar=7881_1233713790.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noisms">noisms</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355439/#Comment_355439" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T08:00:22+00:00" title="January 23, 2012  8:00AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite><br/>I think if I'd had less fun with them, Dungeon World would have ended up being Vampire World or Shadowrun World instead.</blockquote>\nOddly enough, Shadowrun World is something that really sounds like it could work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355445/#Comment_355445" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T08:23:44+00:00" title="January 23, 2012  8:23AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noisms</cite><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite><br/>I think if I'd had less fun with them, Dungeon World would have ended up being Vampire World or Shadowrun World instead.</blockquote>\nOddly enough, Shadowrun World is something that really sounds like it could work.<br/><br/>Mouse Guard did it already.  *laugh*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355508/#Comment_355508" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T13:46:17+00:00" title="January 23, 2012  1:46PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite><br/>I also want to point out that DW requires prep and maps and all that stuff.

All of my best games have been based on ideas solicited from the players and created in vague outline as they finish making characters.

Fronts are the only prep that I think is really required, and even then only for longer running games. For a single session the entire thing can be on-the-fly.
