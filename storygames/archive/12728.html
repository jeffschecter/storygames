But I'll give it a shot!<br/><br/>OK, so first of all, <a href="http://whereareyourkeys.org/" rel="nofollow">Where are your Keys?</a> is a language fluency game that uses sign language and a bunch of intuitive techniques to accelerate learning. Evan Gardner and Willem Larsen have been using it to revitalize endangered languages. <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2009/09/21/fluency-play/" rel="nofollow"><i>SOME </i>crazy people</a> seem to think that these principles could be applied to gameplay and game design.<br/><br/>So, James, some basic questions: How many people played. and how many in the lunatic fringe? (the fringe is basically the outside observers of the game, who are encouraged to participate by copycatting along.) Did anyone rotate from the Fringe into the Inner Circle, or vice versa?<br/><br/>How far did you go in the conversation? What's That? Whose is That?

This was a deliberate choice, part of Technique: Party Setup.<br/><br/>I really need to get Party Setup into video.  In a nutshell, it's deliberately arranging Setup! to showcase the game and the viral coolness, and explicitly not about reaching the target conversation, or building fluency.  I think it worked pretty well, and we also built some fluency, which was a complete bonus cool!<br/><br/><br/><br/>thanks,<br/>James                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287059/#Comment_287059" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-17T23:35:45+00:00" title="August 17, 2010 11:35PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's great, guys. Sounds like you had a fun time, for sure.<br/><br/>James, it would be super-rad to see a technique video from you. I'm sure Willem and Evan would love it. In fact, part of the game's strength is that it's open source and viral--everyone who plays is adding to the game, figuring things out for making it work in their particular setting and needs, and if that info filters back to "WAYK central," then everyone benefits!<br/><br/>It's also cool that you saw fluency develop even in spite of not aiming for it. I suspect that it's <i>impossible</i> to enter into a Where Are Your Keys? game with sincere engagement and not build <i>some </i>fluency. Your game looks lie yet another exhibit in that case. From what Gregor and Daniel are saying, I'd say the fluency and retention was remarkable.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>I don't remember how to speak French or German, but I still have the body memory for all the statements we covered in the 20 minute session.

That's a huge element in WAYK's design...the mnemonic of signing helps you along <i>while</i> you're learning, and gives you a reflexive association that helps you call it up later. And without the pressure of memorizing or "keeping it all straight," it's actually easier, in some Zen-like way, to run yourself through the steps to get back up to speed. And every time you do, you retain a bit more and more.<br/><br/>So, a few more questions: how long, total, did the game run? How long did you run English-and-sign-language, before switching to French or German? How did yo decide on those languages--James, did you come prepared to run those languages, or did you poll players for languages they could run, or what?<br/><br/>Man, I would love to see some video of this game!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287242/#Comment_287242" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T11:10:06+00:00" title="August 18, 2010 11:10AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played for maybe a half hour or 45 minutes total, with probably about that much again spent discussing and yakking.  I dropped English from the sign language after the first couple go-rounds of the table, and was just signing.  We didn't so much "switch" to French or German so much as after getting everyone comfortable with 'What is that?' and explaining some techniques and playing a bit more, I just added "Qu'est-ce'que c'est?" when I signed.  We went around a couple times with that, and I talked about how easy it is with the signs to just add the language, and everyone <i>knows</i> without needing to be "taught".  Then Gregor signed at my black pen and said "Vas ist das?" and we went around a couple times in German.<br/><br/>Video exists.  Jennifer J. Dixon was our spontaneous videographer, so I imagine that it's somewhere in her queue of "Things I recorded at Gencon that need to be processed."
