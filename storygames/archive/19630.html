To some, it's an unethical and dysfunctional practice; to others it is an artistic/creative tool like any other. For the purposes of this thread, you can use your own definition, so long as it suits my criteria (below).<br/><br/>So, in this thread, let's collect Actual Play experiences of railroading, and how they were positive for you and/or your group.<br/><br/>Tell us about a time when 1) you were a player in a game, 2) the GM (or whoever) railroaded the game in some way <i>you weren't aware of</i> OR <i>did not consent to</i>, 3) you found out about it later, and 4) you see it as a positive experience which enriched the game. (And explain why!)<br/><br/>Criteria <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is the important part. Some people say that being deceived is what makes railroading bad; others say it's not the deception, but the fact that it is done without consent. However, I think everyone can agree that if both happen, it's railroading. For the purposes of this thread, either will do, however. (But a situation where you were aware it was happening AND were happy it was going on doesn't qualify for these purposes: that doesn't sound even potentially problematic, and would be considered Participationist play or something similarly benign, or at least easily treatable, by 9 out of 10 RPG theorists.*) <br/><br/>So, please make sure your AP fulfills those criteria, above. (And let's leave the GM's perspective out of this for now; that's going to be quite different.)<br/><br/><br/>*: Names of theorists withheld for confidentiality purposes.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436126/#Comment_436126" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-31T16:23:36+00:00" title="July 31, 2014  4:23PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2014 4:24PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Footnote:<br/><br/>I'd rather just have your responses here, to see what you have to say.

He loaned me his coat, and then disappeared forever.  I still have the coat.<br/><br/>Sean was an excellent actor.  He had a setpiece planned where he introduced a creepy villain, and that villain had us all as a captive audience to give us a creepy speech.<br/><br/>I don't recall the player characters doing much of anything besides reflecting on the hooks we were handed and moving between locations.  There was certainly no fighting.  I can't remember how I felt about that at the time; I vaguely remember just enjoying acting out characters in a room full of new people.  No one ever told me "there won't be any meaningful decisions for you", but I don't recall feeling disappointed.  I'm a solid actor myself, so merely expressing my vision of my guy felt meaningful.<br/><br/>Anyway, we went where the GM funneled us, and then he got to deliver his creepy speech, and the speech was great.  He was clearly inspired by Bob from Twin Peaks.  I was the only person in the room who got the reference, and Sean was grateful that I gave him the hat tip rather than "you're just stealing this, I've seen this before".  <br/><br/>Anyway, most of what I just wrote is guesswork (this was 10+ years ago), but the one thing I remember for sure is Sean as Bob lurching and snarling around the room.<br/><br/>I feel pretty sure that there's no way Sean would have done that without first making sure he had control of the scene and wouldn't be interrupted by some "I attack the bad guy!" shit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436138/#Comment_436138" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-31T21:23:40+00:00" title="July 31, 2014  9:23PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Dave!<br/><br/>I hope it doesn't sound like I'm picking nits here: I'm just looking for some clarification. With that in mind, it sounds to me like you were both *aware* of the style of play ("we went where the GM funneled us") <i>and</i> consenting to it (although presumably not explicitly). Would you agree with that or disagree?<br/><br/>(Although I guess you're implying that there was stuff going on that you just don't remember, like some way of guaranteeing you wouldn't interrupt the bad guy's monologue, other than the GM just being a good actor and having captivated your attention, which might qualify as railroading, yes?)<br/><br/>Great little example, though, in any case!

But if you'd asked me my preference, I certainly would have requested more agency.<br/><br/>I'd liken it to showing up for ice cream, hoping to pick your own flavor, eating chocolate instead because that's what's offered, and just enjoying eating chocolate ice cream with friends regardless of whether you'd rather have had strawberry.  It's not <i>all</i> about the ice cream flavor.  <br/><br/>The enthused vibe in the room helped.  Maybe that's because other players <i>did</i> know the deal and <i>were</i> actively consenting?

However, I think I can contribute to the thread explaining why I have so few experiences that meet the first criteria. You see, I have studies in advertising and also studied to be an art critic at colleage. I learned to carefully read people since I was a kid, and as a comic writer, I'm familiar with thousands of plots and twists from many kinds of forms of fiction. So, GMs have actually a hard time trying to play illusions on me. As most writers will know, it's kinda easy to foretell how it's gonna end an story or at least what's gonna be the biggest issue coming, based on carefully looking at the small details introduced and their presentation. If the details aren't subtle enough and no red herrings obfuscate them, the ending can be guessed at first glance. If these details aren't presented at all, the story feels bad written since "unexpected" twists will be more like "unreasonable" or "unexplainable" twists.<br/><br/>So, while I despise being manipulated in real life, I can take it in the fiction as a natural part of the game. "Hey, it's getting late! ok, let's move foward, your characters arrive at the dungeon at sunset, who's going first?" Is a barely memorable piece of railroading, but one that responds to a problem as players getting distracted with things outside the game. "No, Buttercup isn't interested in you and is in fact ready to tell his father about your advances, so better get out of town for now" Is valid if you know the player enough to be sure this is him trying to make the game go gonzo, while the rest of the players just wanted a serious adventure. At least is valid railroading for certain gaming style and certain groups of players, and one kind of railroading I've almost always been grateful of.<br/><br/>So basically, most of the best railroading I've seen as a player hasn't been too good as an aesthetical experience to make them memorable, but they have been good enough that I don't remember much of the sub-optimal playing conditions that triggered them. <br/><br/>In a separate note, asking one of my players if he remembered one time that I railroaded him, he couldn't pinpoint some specific moment. Either I was a terrific illusionist then or haven't otherwise made memorable railroading scenes, though I remember making illusioninsm left and right on every campaign.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436205/#Comment_436205" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-01T16:01:18+00:00" title="August  1, 2014  4:01PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ^^^ This.

"Hey, it's getting late! ok, let's move foward, your characters arrive at the dungeon at sunset, who's going first?"<br/><br/>- Everyone smiles and nods. "Great, I draw my sword and check for traps!"<br/><br/>This is, from a certain point of view, not railroading, but not that different from, "Hey, it's getting late. How do you all feel if we skip ahead to when you get to the dungeon?" "Sure, sounds good!" (Which I'm pretty sure no one would ever call railroading.)<br/><br/><i>and</i><br/><br/>2. "Hey, it's getting late! ok, let's move foward, your characters arrive at the dungeon at sunset, who's going first?"<br/><br/>- Players complain or try to "run off the rails", perhaps changing their travel plans or trying to arrive at the dungeon later or earlier, or setting out in the opposite direction.<br/>- The GM subtly changes things so that the characters end up at the dungeon at sunset anyway, or invents a huge storm which forces them to take shelter under the cliff... which is where the dungeon is, etc.<br/><br/>This is the one that I consider railroading, personally, and I'd like to hear if anyone has positive experiences along these lines.<br/><br/>I suppose a simple, "I resisted at first, but then I realized it was actually a good technique, and we used it with the group from then on" is a potential benign use of this technique (to overcome existing biases or habits, force the group into a different type of play which it turns they enjoy after all).

The other 1% has seen some very artless things.  The question in my mind is not "railroading versus not railroading" but rather "artful, purposive use of the technique versus clueless, aggressive, or ego-driven use of it."  Some GMs are artists, and I'm looking for them.<br/><br/>From observation of random samples I'd say the majority of GMs are pretty mediocre, artistically speaking.  So if given a choice between a railroad and a slow-paced, bumbling mess of random details interspersed with "ummm" and page-flipping, I'll take the railroad.  At least that GM has a strong sense of what they're presenting.  Such clarity increases my faith that I'm in the hands of an artist, not completely wasting my time playing what might as well have been a random solo game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436218/#Comment_436218" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T00:06:39+00:00" title="August  2, 2014 12:06AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me that condition 1 is there for a good reason.<br/>All my own experiences fail condition 4 (and sometimes both 4 and 1).<br/>I liked the conditions and it\u2019s interesting to see examples of play that met them all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436219/#Comment_436219" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T00:13:00+00:00" title="August  2, 2014 12:13AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2014 12:20AM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree, <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a>, which is why I effectively exclude myself from answering.

Gardmore Abbey, the far-and-away best 4E module I've ever played or heard about in terms of open-endedness and meaningful choices. However, there is an NPC "hireling" type who joins the party, who in the final scene turns into a giant bad-ass you have to fight. It's a quite beautiful twist, but there's really no way around it: the NPC *has* to join your party at the outset, and the end of the Quest inevitably triggers the thing that makes him go psycho.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436246/#Comment_436246" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T12:26:34+00:00" title="August  2, 2014 12:26PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt,<br/><br/>I think that particular story would be really interesting when and if some players tried to do something which messed with that setup.

Would you say that's a bad thing, or does it simply let the GM "off the hook"?  If you take a look at the DayTrippers module I posted yesterday you'll see it's both railroady and sandboxy, but on different levels.  <i>You really need to consider different narrative levels when you think about questions like this.</i> <br/><br/>Without giving away any spoilers...  In my DT module it's totally possible to break out of the small railroad (the one that goes NPC to NPC to NPC) and you can sandbox around randomly for as long as you want, but ultimately the whole thing is moving along an even <i>bigger</i> railroad with basically two possible endings.  <br/><br/><i>(I just realized how similar that structure is to "Ghosts in the Machine".  Huh!  So that's a structure that I sometimes reuse in my personal style, I guess.  Interesting!)</i><br/><br/>So what I'm saying is: (1) sometimes the designer does the railroading, is there something wrong with that as well, and (2) consider different levels of freedom and operational grainsize when looking for tracks, because while you have freedom on one level you are probably still being railroaded on another.  ("The Quiet Year" comes to mind, but it's just one very clear example.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436260/#Comment_436260" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T14:22:07+00:00" title="August  2, 2014  2:22PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>WarriorMonk, in your examples, was there any lack of consent from the players?<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>I suppose a simple, "I resisted at first, but then I realized it was actually a good technique, and we used it with the group from then on" is a potential benign use of this technique (to overcome existing biases or habits, force the group into a different type of play which it turns they enjoy after all).

Some players of my group get paranoid and tend to overplan and overthink when they are in town, and often go to try and byt several wondrous items like they were travel rations, and never buy travel rations assuming they always leave the town with plenty of them. (But that was only because the GM didn't want to spent game time roleplaying about how they buy this flavor of rations or the other and discuss the price with the vendor using diplomacy or bluff rolls)<br/><br/>So, while at some points the GM ended up cutting everybody's resting and prep time, it kinda worked to have everyone worry a bit more about the upcoming mission. The thing is, you can't be ready for everything and that helps you to think on your feet and keep the game interesting. As a GM I ended up applying this railroading technique every once in a while, when a combat-oriented game threatens to become into something isn't designed to support.<br/><br/>Oh, and it's still railroading, even if it's for the benefit of the players and it doesn't create dysfunctional play or arguments; the GM is taking away player's agency to make the fiction focus on one kind of situations. There's no illusion and no participationism except for the player's tacit acknowlegmnt that the scene has changed, when they use their characters to interact with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436261/#Comment_436261" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T14:26:50+00:00" title="August  2, 2014  2:26PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WarriorMonk,<br/><br/>I'm not 100% sure I understood your description correctly, but from what I did understand that's an interesting point: in some games, a strong-arm approach to cutting or skipping scenes can have a dramatic effect on outcomes.

This was in a LARP called "Cosmic Conspiracy" which I participated in around 1991.  The game was set in a rather typical <i>Illuminati!</i>-type world.  I believe one hour equaled one year of gametime, though it may have been one month of gametime.  All players had a profession but secretly belonged to one or another secret society (of which there were many, all running at cross-purposes to each other of course).  Early in the game the "President" (an NPC actor) came on the short-circuit TV to tell us that the US economy was in peril, terrorists blah blah blah.  We were told that we should spread our money around and spend it freely, or else the economy might collapse.  Several hours went by.  Fortunes were pursued, secrets were discovered, etc.<br/><br/>After the lunch break, the second act began.  We all resumed character and play continued, only to be interrupted by another TV message from the "President".  He was saddened to tell us that our efforts to save the economy had failed, that the US economy was being ratcheted down, and that from here on out, all currency would have exactly 50% of its previous value.  Our savings were halved.  Thank you and have a nice day.  Groans of disappointment went up from all over the building.  Everything we had worked so hard for now seemed paltry and stupid.  But after a short time we acquiesced to the new conditions, and play resumed at a slightly slower pace.  By the end of the game we had adjusted to the newly-set currency values.<br/><br/>When the game was over I talked to the GMs.  They told me that the halving of the dollar's value was something that was set in stone, it would have happened no matter what we had done in the first act.  So the "don't let the terrorists win" thing was really just a ruse to get us spinning our money around like crazy.  There was nothing we could have done to prevent this.<br/><br/>Although <i>as a player</i> I was among the groaners when the announcement came down, <i>as a designer</i> I was intrigued by the social experiment they had performed.  They had demonstrated that within our simulated economy, the face value of currency is unimportant as long as everyone's money is equally effected, and that given a little bit of time, people can adjust to radical devaluations of currency without the whole of society losing its momentum completely.  This may seem obvious from a distance but it feels very different when you're inside it, and invested in it.<br/><br/>Obviously this was a far cry from being a truly empirical economic experiment, but nevertheless I found it fascinating - much more so than my previous (illusory) notion that the value of the dollar would somehow be pegged to the total amount of all transactions in a game year.  The fiction itself was ephemeral (I don't remember my character's name or profession, nor a single thing he bought or sold), but the lesson I drew from the metagame - the moral of the economic experiment - was permanent.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436334/#Comment_436334" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-03T18:05:29+00:00" title="August  3, 2014  6:05PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's pretty interesting, Tod, thanks.

Would you agree with that, or not? </blockquote>Today I would agree with that.  But at the time we didn't even know the word "larp".  Cosmic Conspiracy was called a game.  I had no idea what to expect because at the time, it had the air of a one-of-a-kind experience.\n<blockquote>As a player, did you feel that a line had been crossed? To what an extent, for example, did you believe that your spending had an impact on this second-act event?</blockquote>We didn't know the second act event would happen, obviously, but we were given to believe that our spending was causally linked to the state of an economic metagame (i.e. a simulation of the GNP or Consumer Confidence Levels of a real national economy), which it turns out, it wasn't.<br/><br/>Did I feel a line had been crossed...  Tough question.  My first feeling was a simple, selfish "Aw, FUCK!" - but that was mostly in-character.  We still didn't know we had been "railroaded" and to this day I guess most people still don't.  I only learned about it because I approached the GMs and started talking shop after the game.  <br/><br/>I do remember feeling that it could have been handled better, but by "better" I really meant <i>more illusionism</i> (perhaps periodic announcements showing the dollar in decline prior to the second act, etc).  It happened so fast that it felt heavy-handed and caused the game to stall for quite a few minutes.  I remember thinking afterwards that if I was the GM I would have foreshadowed it more.  But underlying all of that, there was still the understanding that the GMs were the GMs, and we were in their world, not our own.  No right to complain on an epistemological level.  Only in character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436340/#Comment_436340" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-03T19:10:09+00:00" title="August  3, 2014  7:10PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great description, thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436347/#Comment_436347" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-03T20:53:11+00:00" title="August  3, 2014  8:53PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good questions about the 4E scenario.

They didn't take away agency from our characters, but they did suggest certain things had happened. Most of these things (e.g. my character looking for a certain other person) had been already established in prior play, but, still, the MC was taking some liberties with the direction in which we were headed. <br/><br/>And, of course, the outcomes of the roll (and the stats chosen) were carefully designed to limit outcomes within a particular sphere. (Perhaps a love letter based on a stat someone had at -1 and a sole positive outcome on a 10+ hit suggests that bad things are going to happen to that character.)<br/><br/>This was an effective and fun way to "fast forward" a bit and resume the game at full tilt.<br/><br/>Arguably, a "love letter" falls somewhere between railroading (a good love letter, I think, doesn't presuppose certain actions of a character, removing player choice) and the regular domain of an MC - making moves in the fiction. The grey area, I would argue, has to do with the scope of the love letter (e.g. "Two weeks have passed, and you're still looking for her...").<br/><br/>Would this be a valid MC move in normal play? Perhaps. But the MC is certainly placing a firmer hand on the tiller when she writes these letters than in typical AW play.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kurisu" title="kurisu"><img alt="kurisu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kurisu">kurisu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436673/#Comment_436673" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-07T21:40:43+00:00" title="August  7, 2014  9:40PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played in a Dark Heresy scenario (hacked to a Renaissance Europe setting and a different ruleset) that involved almost literal railroading. That is, our PCs were packed into a carriage driven by our patron's lackey. This carriage carried us from scene to scene until we got to the main adventure location. Our patron also, annoyingly, accompanied us the whole way, giving us orders and preventing us from sticking our noses where they didn't belong. By the time we got to the final, climactic scene, I got the sense that no matter what choices we made as investigators, the story would have ended with the same set-piece encounter.<br/><br/>BTW, I'm not sure I buy either lack of awareness or lack of consent as necessary criteria for railroading. In general, I think it's more that the players are not aware of any alternative to railroading &amp; illusionism, and consent is given tacitly, because most players just want to play a game and, again, aren't aware of any alternative or don't really care to pursue one. I'm the annoying player who rebels and tries to run off the rails.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning" title="DustinDePenning"><img alt="DustinDePenning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning">DustinDePenning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436674/#Comment_436674" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-07T22:22:51+00:00" title="August  7, 2014 10:22PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2014 10:23PM by DustinDePenning.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think ruling out consent or knowledge precludes the majority of railroading memories for two reasons:<br/>1) if you see the rails and decide it's worth following or at least not fighting, this is consent<br/>2) if you didn't see the rails, the GM won't volunteer this information later.<br/><br/>I just can't really think of a positive railroad situation that I wasn't aware of simply because the GM wouldn't reveal it. But I digress. I have an example of a kind of railroading that players wouldn't consent to but would be thankful for when the tables turned.<br/><br/>I played a lot of 3.5. Came up on crunch roll-playing and build optimization. We always expected a cool story, but badly wanted to show off what our characters could do.<br/><br/>There was always at least one player who would get out of control, use some odd ability to mess up the whole party and narrative path, and then laugh and chuckle as he watched things crumble. The GM would then threaten "blue lightning" or some other railroading effect, and we'd thankfully get back to the game.<br/><br/>Everyone consented to the railroading except the target player. However, with the tables turned, that player would be thankful for the railroading when someone else got out of control.<br/><br/>But that was just a bunch of immature kids trying to make sense of a game above our pay grade.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436679/#Comment_436679" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-07T22:58:07+00:00" title="August  7, 2014 10:58PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whenever you're told that your character is doing something you don't agree with, or can't do a thing that should usually be able to do with no problems and there's no explanation nor a way to take it back -but you're warned that there's an explanation behind it that requires you to renounce to your preconceptions about the world and the rules that limit reality- it's natural to feel uneasy about it. Certain horror games benefit from this to create a particular atmosphere.<br/><br/>Think of this scene: A player stablishes his character as a normal mental healthy person. But then small details of his world begin to warp as a warning that reality isn't what it used to be. One day, the character wakes up and without reason, buys a weapon. The GM imposes this scene and then allows the player to act his reaction. Let's say he disposes of the weapon, returns it to the vendor or something. Then the GM tells him that on the next day his character has an argument with his boss, goes back to his office, opens a drawer and finds there the weapon again. Then he gives the player back the control of his character  so he's free to dispose of the weapon again, try to hide it, etc. The next day on the morning, the character hears noises on the basement. When/if the player goes to investigate, he finds the weapon on the floor and his boss tied inside a box. And the guy completely freaks out from the PC as soon as he comes closer.<br/><br/>So, in this case, the railroad has been used to create this atmosphere, as if the PC is losing his mind and doing things behind his own back, or he's maybe the victim of a complex and insane practical joke or... well, possibilities are endless and all you need is to ask the player what he thinks is happening to find even worse and more interesting options to keep the story rolling into suspense. A GM used a lot of tricks like this for a magnificent one-shot suspense/terror game. After the first three empty rooms we found, we started to fire our weapons like crazy at the first noise we heard, which turned to be a rat. We almost killed ourselves on the process, but it ended up being an awesome scene, as we were more than grateful that it was only a rat after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
