Indies revived my interest in RPGs a few years ago and the more I dig into them and the community the more interested I've become in Nordic Larps.  Is there anything like Nordic Larp happening here in the States?  Are there jeepform meetups or communities involved in this style of gaming?  I read stuff at the Jeeper site, other blogs, the various Knutepunkt publications, etc., as much as possible.  I want to get involved with these sorts of games but have no clue on where or how to begin.  Of course I've considered introducing scenarios and games to my core gaming group but they're a fairly traditional bunch and would be immediatly turned off by the prospect of Larp regardless of its subject.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny tips or recommendations would be appreciated.  If there are others interested in forming some sort of group or working towards developing a regional scene I'm located north of Baltimore, MD.  I attend GenCon and would be down for traveling to other nearby cons or even setting up mini-cons for this sort of activity.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DaveC" title="DaveC"><img alt="DaveC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DaveC">DaveC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332778/#Comment_332778" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T12:49:02+00:00" title="July  1, 2011 12:49PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not precisely what you're looking for, but you could do a whole lot worse than to attend Intercon Mid-Atlantic, given that it's practically in your backyard (Bethesda, MD):<br/><br/><a href="http://www.imalarp.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.imalarp.com/</a><br/><br/>The community that attends this con, and its sister annual con in Boston, is focused largely around theater-style larps. The convention is end-to-end theater-style larping, which lets you sample a bunch of different games from a lot of different authors. More importantly, it lets you meet a lot of other people who are interested in various aspects of larping, including some with a background in the more jeep-like end of things. From there you can find out a lot about other games going on in the area, which might eventually lead you to exactly what you're looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332783/#Comment_332783" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T13:07:28+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  1:07PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a somewhat moribund community <a href="http://www.structured-freedom.com/forum/" rel="nofollow">here</a> devoted to structured freeform.

Leave the mechanical harness behind, and go into character. Immersing in character is pretty much standard, and the one thing driving most of the drama.<br/><br/>Designing for this has much to do with giving the players constructive character-meterial, with relations and motivations as the main tools, and then trust the players to grasp it, and develop it into their own drama ...<br/><i>(much as you would expect a child to create its own life, when it has come to age)</i><br/><br/>There's a lot of joy to be had in it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332866/#Comment_332866" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-02T10:08:59+00:00" title="July  2, 2011 10:08AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christian Griffen</cite>Good question!

I had joined a local vampire larp in Chicago for a few months, but then gave it up and moved a short while after.  <br/><br/>I later tried a few larps at local Bay Area conventions.  I don't think I slowed the game down, but I sometimes found it unsatisfying because I was cast as a character who was outside the center of the action.  It seems like a common problem in convention larps is that people close to the organizers are put in the most important roles, making it off-putting for newcomers.  Still, it was a useful introduction.  <br/><br/>It is quite easy to organize one of the Shifting Forest Storyworks Parlor Larp series - they have a very standard format and are fairly well explained.  The Jeepform scenarios vary more in how they are presented, but have many excellent options.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332876/#Comment_332876" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-02T11:20:20+00:00" title="July  2, 2011 11:20AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way we got new people involved in our White Wolf LARP was to give them a "visiting character" who was WAY more powerful than most of the game, and who had pieces of information/property that a lot of people wanted. That way there was a cushion for if they got themselves in a bind (power level) and there was a fix if they got bored (someone new would run up to them and yell at them about something).<br/><br/>I'm surprised people haven't suggested "try your local White Wolf LARP", the Camarilla is still the biggest non-boffer organization out there.
