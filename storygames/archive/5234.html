I wanted something dark and murky, but easy to run and play in. An exploration through the human psyche that was surprisingly easy to tap into.<br/><br/>And I just finished making that game. It's called Dostoevskyan Murder Ballad. It's one of those expert mash-up games that just blatantly steals from other games that do things well (see Savage Donjon Squad for a historical precident).<br/><br/>The game steals heavily from PDQ, The Shadow of Yesterday, and Shock:. It steals some, but less, from Burning Wheel's Duel of Wits as well as Victoriana 2nd Ed. Hopefully the publishers of the above games realize that this is a work of personal joy, not a commercial or market endeavor.<br/><br/>You can get your paws on Dostoevskyan Murder Ballad <a href="http://joepub.fileave.com/DostoevskyanMurderBalladv1.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

Then I read:\n<blockquote><cite>From page 6:</cite>He spends two points of Valor to bring the 5 on the Ghost Die down to a 3. Now it\u2019s too small to eat any dice, and so both of his dice stand, giving him a total of 10.</blockquote>\nAnd I thought "Okay, so a Ghost Die could eat one or both dice."  Now, as I type this, I'm thinking a Ghost Die only eats one die, and I'm assuming the highest die it can eat.  But I'm not 100% on that.  Clearly the first misread was just a matter of me being confused, but it might be worth briefly unpacking a touch more.<br/><br/>My second one is a weird little build-up idea that plays on Keys (and is something similar to what I'm playing with in Mythender, which is why it comes to mind).  So, a Key costs 5 XP and you get 10 XP to buy it off.  That binary-ness feels a touch flat in what you're going for, but it's easy on the bookkeeping.  The thought I had, though, was to keep track of how many times you've gained XP off that Key, and that feeds back into the award for the Buy-off.  Say you're got just bought the Key of Addiction.  If you haven't done anything with that Key before you Buy it off, , it's only worth 5 XP.  Say you've indulged a couple times -- put a couple tick marks the key, and if you Buy it off after that, cash it in for 7 XP.   Then you sacrifice something for the addiction, and put another tick mark down as you collect your 3 XP -- then the Buy-out is worth 8. Cap the reward at 10 XP.<br/><br/>It's a random idea, and it might be too much, but it also might feed into some really messed up, deeply hellish play with loads of heavy pushing.  If that's something you want.<br/><br/>I'm not sure where I'm going to be able to find a camel at this hour.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118173/#Comment_118173" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-06T11:39:43+00:00" title="January  6, 2008 11:39AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ghost Dice - Sorry for the lack of clarity on Ghost Dice.

The Ghost Die marked 6 can eat EITHER the 2 OR the 4. But now this brings up a situation that I never thought of: who gets to decide which die the Ghost consumes? If its the controlling player, then it's going to be the 2. If it's the opposing player, it's going to be the 4.<br/><br/>Therefore, I am adding another clarification to Ghost Dice: If a Ghost Die could consume several different die, the controlling player chooses which die is eaten.<br/><br/>So, yeah. A single Ghost Die can only ever eat a single regular die. And the player always chooses which die is removed if there are options.<br/><br/>--------------------<br/><br/>Well, Dostoevskyan Murder Ballad intentionally kept everything as familiar as possible to the original elements.

Roman went through some serious ups and downs, while Sergei and Vassily stumbled through their own bad habits, collecting disasters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118233/#Comment_118233" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-07T03:41:30+00:00" title="January  7, 2008  3:41AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Joe,<br/><br/>I like it - a lot. But the document is mostly about the resolution mechanics and characters etc.<br/><br/>Could you say something about what kind of stories you have in mind for this, assuming you are not constraining it to Russia in the 19th century? Do you see the group jam on the setting and setup together, or as something the GM brings to the table?<br/><br/>So: Downplay is a kind of shared Key for all players?<br/><br/>Per                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118261/#Comment_118261" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-07T08:07:33+00:00" title="January  7, 2008  8:07AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnstone, I'm not happy with the "pay 1XP mechanic to heal all damage", and furthermore, it's not even in the rules as written. I just made something up to keep it from being TOO harsh.<br/><br/><br/>Per,<br/><br/>Downplay is exactly a shared Key! Except that it's only got the 1XP ping. It's a Key that furthers mood and tone rather than a character.<br/><br/>As far as stories and stuff, it's basically supposed to be a character drama about petty low lives. I think we hit that pretty much on the head when we first played it yesterday.There isn't a lot of story building material or even goal setting... I had each player tell me what their character was after in the world, framed them into a scene, and let them get into a squabble with an NPC. From that point on, there was loose scene framing, but no real GMing to speak of... we ran it essentially GMless - when an NPC needed to be made, one of us statted it up. In each scene, we either played our PC or an NPC. It was all character driven.<br/><br/>I'm not sure exactly what I want in terms of stories. I made Dostoevskyan Murder Ballad to act as an engine. I wanted something with Keys and character driven, but simpler than TSoY. I wanted something grim and disheartening, but that was still fun to pick up and play. I didn't give much thought to the stories I wanted to tell with it, beyond that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118403/#Comment_118403" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-07T21:58:49+00:00" title="January  7, 2008  9:58PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is looking good, Joe.
