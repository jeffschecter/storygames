And it's leaving me a bit confused about how these would play out in a one-shot session.<br/><br/>In particular, I get how the Weakness flashbacks would work and what the drawbacks are. But the Strength flashbacks seem a little too cut and dried.<br/><br/>"Using a Strength <b>ends the encounter</b> and <b>removes all remaining Threat Tokens</b> in the encounter." (p. 25)<br/><br/>So if I have five players at the table and have planned five encounters for this one-shot planet, what is to stop each player from simply using a Strength flashback whenever each of the encounters gets at all difficult? I know that sounds gamey and I'm not really not trying to be flippant. It just seems like a pretty simple tool with no real drawback.<br/><br/>What am I missing here?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195758/#Comment_195758" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T21:12:38+00:00" title="March  5, 2009  9:12PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>What am I missing here?</blockquote>3:16 is not designed for one-shot play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195761/#Comment_195761" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T21:19:43+00:00" title="March  5, 2009  9:19PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a one-shot, I would limit Strength usage to a first-come, first-serve basis.

They don't come back. If your players just blaze the first planet, just roll up a second one and go on with things. They won't have any more strengths, and since the almost skipped the first five encounters you should have plenty of time left in the session. In fact, you might even have a more enjoyable session if this happens, since most of the time you'd miss out on all that post mission kill counting and arguing about rank in a one shot, and that's part of the 3:16 experience!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oreso" title="oreso"><img alt="oreso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oreso">oreso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195770/#Comment_195770" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T23:22:14+00:00" title="March  5, 2009 11:22PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd just play the rules as written.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've ran a few one shot games, and I haven't had this happen yet, not to say it won't happen though I guess. I do only introduce the Flashback rules when it seems like they might need them though, so, the players just might not think to exploit them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, you might also consider:<br/>\nIf someone wastes a Strength: Try and isolate them from the team and ambush them. Or just pick on them in a fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nOR, Play through a planet really quickly. Then play the real planet. I've done this once, and it was pretty good. Gives you chance to do the whole 'between missions' thing too. I did it the other way though, like, started off with a really hard planet with a high AA, then had them murdering innocent jelly fish who's only attack was to explode when shot. In the second planet, it was the conflicting orders and rivalries within the team that provided the real opposition.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, just let them do it. Yay they win! Let them have their crappy medal. Of course, other teams would have got a higher kill count, but oh well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mans" title="mans"><img alt="mans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iRxOHEiGuPM/TuCnFScfciI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/PQTJfJAblzg/s45/rs.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mans">mans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195777/#Comment_195777" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T00:34:01+00:00" title="March  6, 2009 12:34AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris,<br/>\nCheck out this thread:<br/>\n<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7744" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7744</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWe followed the guidelines from Gregors post for our one shot and it worked very well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus" title="Scurvy_Platypus"><img alt="Scurvy_Platypus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus">Scurvy_Platypus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195783/#Comment_195783" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T01:53:50+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  1:53AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bear in mind I've only played a couple of times...<br><br>First time, Gregor ran the game. He had a planet made in a couple of minutes and away we went. He seemed to have a strategy to how he used his tokens. They weren't all slapped out there at once, nor did he put them out in even numbers as I recall. Still, that game I think only a couple of us used Flashbacks. We only made it through one planet in the time slot we had.<br><br>2nd time was with a fellow by the name of Paul and again, he whipped a planet up pretty quick. Slightly longer than Gregor, but it's really not hard to make one up. Paul wasn't as familiar with the rules (he'd never run the game before) but we still cruised through a couple of planets. I actually ended the first planet using a Flashback. Paul slapped the rest of his tokens forward for a big smackdown and I totally wiped it out right at the begining. He pushed 'em in, I Flashbacked, we did the after-mission thing with promotions and whatnot, and Paul simply rolled up another planet.<br><br>So, really I don't think there's anything stopping the group from "going nova" and wiping out a planet with Flashbacks. 5 minutes later, they're going to be on another planet without _any_ flashbacks, and chances are they're going to be getting some gleeful smackdown.<br><br>As for 3:16 not being designed for one-shots... not sure if that's humor or not.

Even if the players spent Strength to buy their way out of all the encounters on a single planet, the amount of time spent would be minimal, and you could quickly move on to a second planet. My experience of playing this as a one-shot at an End Game minicon was that we players didn't even think to spend our strengths unless it was the only way to save ourselves. Not everyone plays a one-shot mindful of the fact that the value of holding on to a precious resource is significantly reduced from campaign play. I'd also note that at that particular one-shot session, the GM arrived with 3 planets outlined on a single sheet of paper, of which we completed 2 (the advancement and character stuff that happens between missions is an important part of the 3:16 experience). I believe there were 4 players, and by the end each of us had spent a Strength, and one of the promoted characters used one of the encounter-ending weapons of mass destruction, but the combat was still brutal and exciting (made me buy the game on the spot).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195861/#Comment_195861" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T09:24:16+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  9:24AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent, guys.
