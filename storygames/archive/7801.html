Trying to avoid the awkwardness instead of dealing with it.<br/><br/>I'm going to edit the initial post to list everything that's been submitted, so I can keep track of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Yokomizo" title="Daniel Yokomizo"><img alt="Daniel Yokomizo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Yokomizo">Daniel Yokomizo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173319/#Comment_173319" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-05T07:26:56+00:00" title="October  5, 2008  7:26AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Daniel, you should totally check out Shreyas' game<i>Mridangam</i>, from<a href="http://plays-well.com/push1.pdf" rel="nofollow">Push vol 1</a>, if you haven't already.</blockquote>\n<p>Very cool, my initial ideas involved hand gestures, but due to the one hour limit (including learning) it wouldn't work. I really like Mridangam's hand gesture system. I read only the first two articles from Push, only those converted to HTML.

Your name and sense and sensibility is all yours. Take yourself into the game..<br/><br/><b>3 - </b>You will all bring a teddybear to the game, preferably your own, but any teddybear will do. The bear is you too, with your name and sense and sensibility. Take your teddybear into the game.<br/><br/><b>4 - </b>There will be one sharp knife in the game. It will be passed from player to player, giving each a chance to have their scenes in the game.<br/><br/><div>* * *</div><br/><b>5 A - </b>A player with the knife will describe a conflict he/she has been in, and tell the players how he/she intend to resolve the conflict. Set up your conflict as a scene that makes your solution possible in a tangible way. Make your scene short and to the point, but be sure to leave room for the other players to introduce some adversaries in your conflict, to engage you in a dialogue that may influence the outcome.<br/><br/><i><span style="color: #660000;"><b>Details on conflict</b><br/>The conflict could be anything, from your childhood, youth or adult life, preferably an actual conflict from your life. Your solution to the conflict in this game may differ though, and may be far more violent than in your real life. The other players act as your friends and/or family, as they chooses themselves.<br/><br/>They  will push and pull at you with their voices, to make you change your resolve and seek solutions more in tune with their ideas. They will always be  people with ideas different from yours, and perhaps even with principles/ideals that is contrary to the solution you propose. they may oppose you in any verbal way, even by threathening with a full break with you. <br/><br/><b>Family </b>may be your mother or father, brother or sister, or any more distant relative. They are <b>not </b>bound by your real family, but may invent a character on the fly and act him out as "Your father". If your co-player wants to, he may use the same "father" in several of your scenes.<br/><br/><b>Friends </b>will be yourselves, placed in the situation. If you need to be childhood friends with the central player to do that, then you are, in this game. And you have to somehow be in opposition to the solution proposed by the central player. Best thing is if you can relate to the situation, and really disagree with the proposed solution.<br/><br/>One of you co-players may even act as <b>your opponent</b>, if there is such a person in the conflict. An opponent will always be a person you have placed in the scene, a person that stands to loose something if you goes through with your intent. Your opponent may also push and pull you, verbally, but may not force you to accept any solution not your own.<br/><br/><b>Co-players:</b> be careful to state who you are when entering a scene: "I am Tomas, your good old friend, and I know your intent! Listen to me: it will not be good for you ...". </span></i><br/><br/><b>5 B - </b>Eventually you will raise the knife, signalling the end of the scene. No more push'n pull is permitted from the other players when you raise the knife. They must be silent now. The solution of the conflict is in your hands. Whatever you friends and family, or opponent, have said, you can do whatever you want in this conflict. Any solution is allowed, even a solution that involves killing or maiming people, torturing them, sending them to jail or letting them be executed in the electric chair. You tell the other players how the conflict finally resolves. They must listen in silence, and watch the possible consequences in silence.<br/><br/><b>5 C1 - </b>If you resolve any conflict by giving pain to yourself or others, you will stab your teddybear at the end of the conflict. You will start with any of the arms or legs, stab it, rip it open and tear the limb from the teddybear. Throw the limb away and take the rest of your teddy into your arms, hug it and hold it close, to comfort it. You will comfort it by telling it something like this: <b>The raven has hurt me! The raven claws and the raven beak has hurt me! But the raven is gone now! Hush raven! Begone!</b><br/><br/><b>5 C2 - </b>If you end a conflict with a stab, and no more arms or legs are left on your teddybear, you must stab its stomach/body. Rip it open and kill it totally! Be violently effective in shredding it to pieces! Leave only the head, your "soul", which you take in your arms. Hug it and hold it close, to comfort it. You will comfort it by saying something along these lines:<b>The raven has killed me! The raven claws and the raven beak has killed me! My life is gone now! Hush life! Be dead, be still!</b><br/><br/><b>5 D - </b>Pass the knife on to the next player. You choose which player is next.<br/><br/><div>* * *</div><br/><b>6 - </b>The next player will then go trough step 5 A to D.<br/><br/><b>7 - </b>When all players have killed their teddybear, themselves, the game is over.<br/><br/><b>Aftermath:</b><br/>If you want to stomp on your teddy-head now, you may throw it on the floor and do so. Or you may go out and bury it, making a silent seremony out of the burial. Or you may take it home, and place it by your bed as a reminder. Or you may throw it in a bin and forget about it.<br/><br/>You may even sit still for a moment, together, as a silent eulogy to the experiences you have shared in the game.<br/><br/>The choice is, as always, yours to make.<br/><br/><i>Have nice life!</i><br/>____________________________________________________<br/><br/>That is my entry in this competition.

I considered making it more complex, with different effects, but I could feel the game slipping into being even bigger. The reason they still exist is so that the player feels like they're making mechanical choices, and so that they don't go too quickly down the slippery slope of increasing stats. This way if, say Pain increases too fast, they can fall back on Misery.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173382/#Comment_173382" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-05T18:56:42+00:00" title="October  5, 2008  6:56PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say it's close, but I don't see the current difference as being particularly meaningful.

Again, I'd say that I feel more like it's a very intense conversation starter, or a interesting form of therapy, but I'm not sure about it being a game. The rules are more of a point of order than a game, at least to me.

In the meantime, here's a card game:<br/><br/><b>CROW\u2019S HOARD</b><br/><i><br/>It is commonly known that certain crows gather shiny objects and hoard them in their nests.  There are plenty of theories, but nobody knows exactly why they do this.  Maybe the crows don\u2019t even know.  Personally, I think it\u2019s because crows are so damned smart that they accomplish all the daily work necessary for survival by the early afternoon, so they figure out little games to divert them for the rest of the day.  I\u2019ll bet that somewhere there\u2019s a crow bragging to the other crows about his shiny dime from 1940, and another one aspires to bring home the moon one day.</i><br/><br/><b>WHAT YOU NEED</b><br/>4 players<br/>A deck of poker cards, with the jokers removed<br/>A copious quantity (at least 14) of small, shiny objects.  Coins, marbles, bits of jewelry, etc.  You could use poker chips or something instead, but that would be lame.<br/><br/><b>GETTING STARTED</b><br/>Place all the shiny objects in a heap in the center of the table.<br/><br/>Shuffle the cards, then deal them all out the players in turn, one card at a time.  Each player should end up with 13 cards.  Play begins with the player to the dealer\u2019s left.<br/><br/><b>PLAYING THE GAME</b><br/>On your turn, choose a card from your hand to \u201clead\u201d the trick.  Place it face up on the table.  The other players must now follow, in turn to the left.  They must each play one card of a suit matching the leading card, unless they do not have any cards of that suit in their hand, in which case they may play any card.  <br/><br/>The highest-ranking card played in the leading suit \u201ctakes the trick.\u201d  The player who took the trick must now perform certain actions indicated by the suits of the cards:<br/><br/>\u2022\tFor every spade, take one shiny object from the pile and place it in your nest (i.e. directly in front of you).<br/>\u2022\tFor every club, take one shiny object from any other player\u2019s nest and place it in your own.  If nobody else has any shiny objects in their nest, then clubs have no effect.<br/>\u2022\tFor every diamond, take a shiny object from your own nest and return it to the pile.  If your nest is empty, diamonds have no effect.<br/>\u2022\tFor every heart, take a shiny object from your own nest and place it in any other player\u2019s nest.  If your nest is empty, hearts have no effect.<br/><br/>Take the cards from that trick and place them in a discard pile.  The player who took the trick must now lead for the next one.<br/><br/>Continue in this manner for a total of 13 tricks, after which all cards will have been played.  The player with the most shiny objects in his nest is the winner.<br/><br/>If you wish, you can re-shuffle the deck and play another hand (that is, another 13 tricks), and continue that process as many times as you wish before ending the game and declaring a winner.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173491/#Comment_173491" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T09:51:15+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  9:51AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>Re: The Crows Danced Against It<br/><br/>Great name, and nice taste in music.<br/><br/>My one critique would be, I'm not sure if I'd count it as a game.

It involves writing and singing songs in the vein of, as well.<br/><br/>Ribbon Drive is a road trip game where players create mix tapes and bring them to the session. The mix tapes directly influence the game's situation and aid in scene framing. Switching tapes is a significant tone-altering event.<br/><br/>So... I guess playing around with music+gaming is something I'm interested in doing. Also, I was listening to music while thinking about this competition and was like, "I should make a game about THIS SONG! Oh my god, I want them to play this song at my funeral.

You know it, but to die with my face rotten, that even the wolves will shrink from it with horror at seeing me\u2026" \u2013 Mah-to-toh-pa (four bears), Mandan war chief, July 30, 1837, the day he died of smallpox <br/><br/>Carrion is a game about the spread of smallpox and Christianity along fur-trading routes during the 17th to 19th centuries in territories that are now part of Canada and the Northeastern and Midwestern United States. Anyone interested in these themes might check out William T. Vollmann's novel <i>Fathers and Crows</i> and R.G. Robertson's history <i>Rotting Face: smallpox and the American Indian</i>. <br/><br/>Carrion is played like a variant of the child's game musical chairs, with some narration. There are more chairs than players, so the point is not to avoid being left standing when the music stops. Instead, players will try to sit at chairs with an advantageous mix of 'party favors' (tokens representing the fur trade, smallpox, and Christian priests) and spacing (it is better to sit separated from the other players than next to them). These tokens, which are concealed so only the person sitting in a chair knows what they have in front of them, determine which players catch the deadly pox and also grant holders of the crow and fur tokens the power to shift players around the table. The goal of the game is to survive and be one of the last two players left alive. <br/><br/>Set up<br/><br/>Carrion is a game for four or more players. It works better with a mix of females and males. Players will need:<br/>\u2022    a table with two more chairs than the number of players; <br/>\u2022    a way of playing music so that all players can hear; <br/>\u2022    one container per chair- so equal to the number of players plus two. (Containers can be cups, bowls, boxes, bags, or even napkins)<br/>\u2022    a number of small tokens representing exposure to small-pox equal to the number of players plus two (such as scraps of paper or beans); <br/>\u2022    a single 'sharp' token representing the crow (such as a bent paperclip); <br/>\u2022    a single 'valuable' token representing the fur trade (a coin or small stuffed animal)<br/><br/>Split players into three groups. The first two groups should be roughly equal in size, the third group is a single player. The first group will agree how to split up the tokens among the containers while the other groups are out of the room. Split the smallpox tokens so there are between zero and two in each container. Then put the crow token in one of the containers and the fur token into a different container. Position the containers so that the tokens are hidden (for example, place tokens under upside-down cups, not in cups.) <br/><br/>The second group will arrange the containers in front of the chairs around the table while the other groups are out of the room. Players in this group can 'shake' the containers to get an idea of what is in each, but cannot open or pick them up to see the exact contents. Agree on how where to place each container- one per chair. <br/><br/>The last 'group' is a single player who will be in charge of starting and stopping the music during the first few rounds of the game- until the first player to die from the pox takes over the job. This player gets the musical device ready. It can be a portable radio, MP3 player or cell phone that plays music, as long as it has speakers. Or it can be the remote to a stereo in the room. In no music device is available, the person responsible for music can sing, hum, or clap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173619/#Comment_173619" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T15:04:50+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  3:04PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Carrion - Pt 2<br/><br/>Play occurs in the following order, repeating each round until all but two players are dead:<br/><br/><br/>A. Circle the table<br/><br/>While the participant in charge of music plays or sings tune, all players walk around the table (like you are playing musical chairs). When the music stops, players take seats. Without pushing other players, try to sit down in a chair that (a) has few pox tokens in front of it (if you know or think you know how they are distributed), (b) is not next to chairs other players are sitting down in, (c) is not next to any corpses once players have started dying, and (d) has the crow token if you know or think you know where it is. As in musical chairs, players must always walk forward at a steady pace; you can't stop in front of a chair until the music ends. <br/><br/>B. Look at tokens <br/><br/>Without letting the other players see what you have, look in your container. <br/><br/>C. Move towards the fur trader<br/><br/>The player with the fur token now announces that they have it. If there are empty chairs next to that player (on one or both sides), the players nearest shift over one seat to sit in the previously empty chair next to the fur player. (Representing the lure of the fur trade). Only the player or players next to the originally empty seat move; other players do not move when the initial shift opens up a new empty seat or seats. When they shift they leave the container in front of them and look at the container at the new chair they shift into. If no one sat at the chair with the fur token, skip this step. <br/><br/>D. Crow moves players<br/><br/>Next the player with the crow token may choose to use their authority as priest to move one other player (not themselves) or swap two players. They can move players in order to separate or unite a female and a male player \u2013 representing the priest's interest in regulating sexual and family life. In a game with only one gender of players, the crow character can separate or united  players with different colored hair- representing Indians and settlers or heathens and Christians. The player(s) who get moved leave the containers in front of them. The crow player can narrate briefly on the situation that led him to move other players around and players who were relocated can add their thoughts. Skip this step if no player has the crow token. <br/><br/>D. Fur trader swaps containers<br/><br/>Then the player with the fur token (who could be different than earlier in the round), can trade their container and all its contents (fur token and any pox tokens) for the container of either of the players sitting adjacent to them. If you have the fur token, you want to trade to a player who hopefully has fewer pox tokens in your container than you do in yours. Players involved in a transaction can briefly narrate what occurred. If no player has the fur token, skip this action. <br/><br/>E. Announce symptoms<br/><br/>After all moves and trades have occurred, any player who was infected by smallpox during the last round raises their hand. <br/><br/>F. Count pox<br/><br/>Each player counts how many pox tokens they have in the container in front of them (currently in front of them if they or their container has moved during the round).  If you are sitting 'alone' with empty chairs on both sides of you, then subtract one from the number of pox tokens you have. If you have players sitting on both sides of you, add one to your number of tokens. If you are sitting next to an infected player, add an additional one to your number of pox tokens for each infected player you are next to. If you are sitting in between two dead players, add an extra one to your total. (There will not be any dead or infected players during the first round). <br/><br/>If you have three or more tokens after factoring in where you are sitting, you have contracted the pox. Do not tell the other players that you are contagious. <br/><br/>G. Narrate <br/><br/>Identify yourself as an Indian if you do not have the crow or fur token, as a European priest if you have the crow token, and an Indian or a European settler if you have the fur token. Give yourself a name and a quasi-historical role or setting if you like. Players who were shifted or conducted trades during the round should briefly narrate how their character moved to follow the animals or commodities of the fur trade or was relocated based on the whims of the priest. Players who took actions as the crow or fur trader can also describe their motivations. Player who are infected should narrate how they are coping with the illness or what they think brought it upon them.<br/><br/><br/>H. Die <br/><br/>Following the first round of play, players who were infected during the previous round die from smallpox. Dying players can share their final words. Dead players stay seated in the chairs they occupied when they died. Dead players can take turns running the music<br/><br/>I. Dead players shift tokens<br/><br/>At the end of the round in which one or more players die, the rest of the players leave the room and the dead player(s) redistribute the contents of their containers among the other containers. There is one exception, each dead player keeps one pox token in the container in front of them, distributing the rest of the tokens and the fur or crow token if they had it. As during the initial distribution, the crow and fur tokens cannot be placed in the same container. <br/><br/>End<br/><br/>The game, and smallpox epidemic, ends when two (or fewer) players are left after the end of a round.

This unexpectedly turned into quite a popular thing.  I've already fallen behind in reading them, so I'm not going to try to comment on every one as they are submitted, saving my more extensive comments for when I pick the ones I'm going to try to play (though I encourage other folks to try out whichever ones excite them).  My plan right now is to spend Sunday reading them and selecting as many as I think a group could conceivably play in a couple game sessions.  Maybe 8, if we imagine a 'standard' session being about 4 hours?<br/><br/>My thoughts on selecting ones to play goes like this:<br/><br/>1. Which games excite me, procedurally?  Which games have guidelines that I am interested to follow, to see what happens?<br/>2. Which games have hooked me with their premises?  Which present ideas or situations I am excited to explore?<br/>3. Which games have embraced the spirit (not necessarily the letter) of the contest challenge?<br/>4. Which games represent a variety of different backgrounds and perspectives on design and play?<br/><br/>However, this shouldn't be about me and my thoughts on the games any more than it needs to be, since I just threw down some structure to inspire other people to make stuff.  Feel free to continue discussing the games in this thread or spinning off other threads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173669/#Comment_173669" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T18:25:18+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  6:25PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha, that will teach you to think of a cool idea for a contest!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ozbot" title="ozbot"><img alt="ozbot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/nCTCPKSKDL4Z7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ozbot">ozbot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173720/#Comment_173720" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T03:07:42+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  3:07AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2008 3:09AM by ozbot.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.

You'll need some poker chips, or a few d10 or whatever, to keep track of Glory. You'll also need a whole bunch of d6. Black, if possible. Dark colors, if not. You'll need an hourglass. Or some method of measuring out an hour of time. Lastly, you'll also need a book of monsters. Many games other than this one have such books as supplements. A few have several. Make your choice as you see fit. Start the timer just as you begin.<br/><br/>There is a terrible, terrible place called the Murderlands, far, far from your home. The people who live nearby say the name doesn't mean what you think it does, but you don't believe them. Nevertheless, you must go there.<br/><br/>You are an Adventurer. Go around in a circle and say three things that distinguish you from other Adventurers. Then go around in a circle and state your sacred Vow: a quest you swore to the gods Above, Below, and Beyond to complete.<br/><br/>Players take turns being the Spotter.<br/><br/>The first Spotter describes how the group enters the Murderlands. They pick a monster from the book, and describe its appearance, and salient abilities in battle, such as fearsome claws, fiery breath, the ability to split in two, or even stranger talents.<br/><br/>Each player chooses to fight Gloriously, or Cooperatively. Reveal such choices simultaneously: an open palm for Cooperation, a closed fist for Glory.<br/><br/>The monster is always slain, although the battle may be fierce and bloody. The next Spotter describes its death. Each player who fought Cooperatively receives two points of Glory for each other player who fought Cooperatively. Each player who fought Gloriously receives one point of Glory for each other player who fought Gloriously, and three points of Glory for each player who fought Cooperatively.<br/><br/>After each battle, put a black die on the center of the table. It represents some of what will be a gradually growing group of birds following you. Ugly, black birds, with harsh calls that sound vaguely like mocking laughter, vaguely like prophecies of doom. They evade all your attacks, ignore all your magics, and you cannot lose them no matter how swiftly you travel.<br/><br/>The new Spotter describes leaving that place of battle, and traveling in the Murderlands, until the group finds another Monster. Repeat the cycle, adding Glory, and placing another black die as more birds are attracted to the slaughter.<br/><br/>Eventually, as the alloted time draws to a close, one Spotter will declare that the group has found the object of their quest:<br/><br/>The Sphinx of Quartz. A crystal statue, bigger than the mind can comprehend, blacker than the night sky itself. They say it will grant those it finds worthy the power to fulfill any oath. They say the birds are its guardians.<br/><br/>They're right.<br/><br/>In mass, the birds descend upon you. Your might will not save you. Your Glory will not save you. (Why did you think it would?) Each player grabs some of the dice on the table: at least one, but not so many that it wouldn't leave at least one left for each player that hasn't taken any yet. If there are any left over, the last player to take dice takes them all.<br/><br/>Every player rolls the dice they've taken. The players who rolled the highest and lowest totals are lost: they are, at their choice, driven away, or slain. Put the dice back in the middle of the table, and repeat this process, until only one player remains.<br/><br/>That player, the Sphinx finds worthy.<br/><br/>They have until the timer runs out to narrate the fruits of their victory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Cleaver" title="Dave Cleaver"><img alt="Dave Cleaver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dscleaver.googlepages.com/avatar_small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Cleaver">Dave Cleaver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173751/#Comment_173751" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T06:19:43+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  6:19AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow this is a popular contest.

In this story and role playing game you go around the circle of players describing the dead bodies you find, and what you can take from them.  At the end of the Prose, there is a period of Gift Giving and Ragnarok.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will need dice, lots and lots of dice for this game (or alternatively playing cards).<br/>\n<br/>\n First everyone who is playing must be able to face each other in a comfortable manner with a shared space between them. Everyone rolls a dice and the highest and lowest dice take the role of Hugin and Munin receptively. The prose then starts. <br/>\n<br/>\nHugin and Munin are Odin's Ravens and represent Thought and Memory.  The Prose starts by Hugin, Thought, grabbing however many dice (or cards)  Hugin thinks is appropriate and putting them at the centre of the table. These are the baubles that are available in the area. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen Munin, Memory, describes a bit about the place where the bodies are found. This doesn't have to be elaborate, Battlefield, Wheat field, Desert, Forest, Gallows, Town , Country home, French Country Kitchen, etc are all more than enough to begin play. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Raven to Munin's Left starts play by describing the body he or she  finds, and what baubles are found upon the body.  If the Raven describes taking a trinket or bauble from the body (what it is doesn't matter, a bit of ribbon, a coloured cloth, a coin etc) they may take as many dice (or cards)  from the centre pile as they feel they can get away with (at least one), but never more than what can be held in one hand. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Prose continues to the left, the next Raven can either investigate the same body, continuing to describing it and any baubles they might find or they can find a new body. If they do use the same body as another player, they cannot contradict anything already said about the body (see example 1). <br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can contradict anything said by Munin about the location of the bodies (see example 2). <br/>\n<br/>\nExample 1, if the player to Munin's Left describes a poor child with no gold and only a piece of coloured string, the next player CANNOT describe the boy as a rich child with lots of gold. You don't like it, go find another body. <br/>\n<br/>\nExample 2, you can't find a space marine in an 18th century battlefield.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe prose continues to the left, with ravens finding new bodies, rummaging over old bodies, and continues likewise until one of three things happen. The dice (or cards) are exhausted, the players are exhausted, or Fenrir is called. Regardless of why the prose stops, play goes to Gift Giving. <br/>\n<br/>\nFenrir<br/>\nSometimes in a game, we have different expectations. Sometimes people will attempt to take too many from dice from the pile, sometimes they will just be ass hats. If a raven is being (Too) greedy, anybody can say Geri is here, Geri is Odin's Wolf whose name means greed. If someone is not being polite, not respecting other's contributions,etc anyone can say Freki is here, who is Odin's Wolf whose name means Ravenous. <br/>\nIf Either Geri or Freki are present, Anyone may say Fenrir is here, and the game will immediately go to Gift Giving, which will conclude with Fenrir's Will being given out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173978/#Comment_173978" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T18:26:12+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  6:26PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last Half, Sorry<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Gift Giving<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the dice or the players are exhausted or Fenrir has been called, the Ravens retreat to their rookery and then give elaborate gifts to each other before Ragnarok or the end of the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the gift giving  instead of taking treasure you have to give it to another player. Being ravens, you naturally brag and lie about  the nature of your gift while giving as little as you can. Ravens use Kennings or Poetic expressions (Conveniently Baldared on this page) to describe  the trinkets you are giving. Each player must give at least one gift, and must follow these rules. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile gift giving you can only give dice at most equal to the to last gift +1 (see example 3)<br/>\n<br/>\nExample 3,  the first gift giver can only give 1 dice, but the next gift giver can give 1 or 2 dice. If they give 2 dice the next gift giver can give 1, 2 or 3 dice. If they give only 1 dice the next gift giver can only give 1 or 2 dice. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs well the last gift, Fenrir's Will cannot be given until everyone has given a gift at least once.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGift giving continues until everyone has given at least one gift and no one wants to give any more gifts, or everyone has given at least one gift and Fenrir's Will has been given. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Raven given Fenrir's Will (a fancy way of saying the end or death ) is removed from the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to improvise but here are some other gifts to give.<br/>\n<br/>\nBaldr's Mistletoe (A Sudden but Inevitable Betrayal), Sif's Golden Hair (Stolen Property), Freyr's Ship Skidhbaldnir ( Flight and Good Winds), Loki's Sleiphir (A deserved comeuppance) Thor's Mjonnir (Lightning and Thunder), Odin's Gungnir (The Hanged man) <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the gift giving, play may continue with Hugin and Munin laying out more bauble dice (or cards) and describing a new area with dead bodies. Alternatively if the players are not up for another round or if Fenrir has been called the game goes to Ragnarok.<br/>\n<br/>\nRagnarok<br/>\n<br/>\nIf after the Gifting, no one wants to play another story round or if Fenrir has been called, all of the players roll all their dice  and total them. If cards were used total them by number with face cards being worth 10 and Aces 1.  The Highest Total becomes Hugin, and the lowest dice total becomes Munin.  Hugin and Munin are the winners.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor further information on Norse Mythology See the Wikipedia pages I used<br/>\nhttp://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology<br/>\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugin_and_Munin             <br/>\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geri_and_Freki<br/>\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenrir<br/>\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnarok<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a Nice PDF Version<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.freewebs.com/ggnewb/huginandmunin.pdf<br/>\n<br/>\nand Here is a link to my Blog Version<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://filbolg.wordpress.com/memory-and-thought-a-conspiracy-a-murder-and-an-unkindness/<br/>\n<br/>\nenjoy, and thank you for your consideration                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173985/#Comment_173985" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T18:54:06+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  6:54PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2008 6:55PM by whiteknife.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I finished my entry: Murderland Bites!.

Maybe we'll get the results in time for Halloween 2009!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, here's my first attempt at a Storytelling Game. It's not got Ravens, Crows or Murder in the title, but I think that's the only rule I've broken (and it's got the right connotations).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nONE FOR SORROW<br/>\nA pack of cards, including Jokers, is dealt out amongst the players. An equal amount each. The excess cards are handed to whichever player is elected to begin the game, known as the Storyteller.<br/>\n<br/>\nIgnore the four suits \u2013 the cards are split into Black and Red, with the Jokers being the exception. The Court Cards (Kings, Queens and Jacks) and Jokers, represent different birds \u2013 Ravens, Crows, Jackdaws and Magpies respectively \u2013 these are cards which introduce the birds to the story and a disruptive element to the game-play (see below).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Storyteller begins to relate a story, the day in the life of a young man. Pick a name for him. He'll be the naive young fool the story revolves around, the events that befall him taking place in a slightly surreal world that seems to contain a proliferation of black birds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout the game, players attempt to play all their cards, based upon events that occur in the story. Each Black card represents a certain type of event that must be mentioned within the story before being played, or else may be played upon a lower number in order to change the event to that dictated by the new card. Black numbered cards can only be played sequentially upon lower numbers, Black or Red, whilst cards of a Red suit are only played to interrupt their Black counterparts. Therefore only a Black Ace, Court Card or Joker can be played at any time, story conditions allowing.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo player may play more than one card at a time, but another player may interrupt when a black card is played. If a Black card is laid that can be followed up by the next number in sequence \u2013 a Two on an Ace, for example, or a Ten on a Nine \u2013 a player holding a suitable card may lay it on top, changing the direction of the story. This card can, in turn, be covered by another player, building a straight, until no-one can play a card. The last person to play a card in this straight is now the Storyteller, and twists the tale according to the card last played.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternatively a Black card can be interrupted at any time by either of its two Red counterparts. In this case the black card just played returns to the hand that laid it, to be replaced by the red card. The role of Storyteller then falls to the person who interrupted with a red card.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a rule of thumb: the Storyteller is always the person to have last played a card. They continue the story based on whichever card currently sits on the top of the pile.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first person to lay all their cards wins the game, drawing the game to a conclusion based upon the events dictated by the last card laid. <br/>\n<br/>\nPart Two to follow...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/psibreaker" title="psibreaker"><img alt="psibreaker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://chestergames.myfreeforum.org/images/avatars/gallery/requests/083.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/psibreaker">psibreaker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174025/#Comment_174025" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T04:37:12+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  4:37AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            THE CARDS<br/>\nOne additional rule is that, with the laying of each card, a particular phrase must be spoken. These phrases express what the cards represent in playing. <br/>\n<br/>\nBLACK ACE ("One For Sorrow")<br/>\nCan be played at any time, following the introduction of a particularly woeful story element.<br/>\n<br/>\nRED ACE ("No Sorrow")<br/>\nCan only be played to negate a Black Ace. The woeful story element is either ignored entirely or demonstrated to be False Sorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nBLACK TWO ("Two For Joy")<br/>\nCan only be played to cover an Ace, following the introduction of a particularly joyful story element.<br/>\n<br/>\nRED TWO ("No Joy")<br/>\nCan only be played to negate a Black Two. The joyful story element is either ignored entirely or demonstrated to be False Joy.<br/>\n<br/>\nBLACK THREE ("Three For A Girl")<br/>\nCan only be played to cover a Two, following the introduction of a girl or young lady to the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nRED THREE ("No Girl")<br/>\nCan only be played to negate a Black Three. The girl or lady is either ignored entirely or removed from the scene due to some unfortunate mishap.<br/>\n<br/>\nBLACK FOUR ("Four For A Boy")<br/>\nCan only be played to cover a Three, following the introduction of a boy or young man to the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nRED FOUR ("No Boy")<br/>\nCan only be played to negate a Black Four. The boy or man is either ignored entirely or removed from the scene due to some unfortunate mishap.<br/>\n<br/>\nBLACK FIVE ("Five For Silver")<br/>\nCan only be played to cover a Four, following the introduction of something silver, or a small gift or reward.<br/>\n<br/>\nRED FIVE ("No Silver")<br/>\nCan only be played to negate a Black Five. The gift, reward or silver item is either ignored entirely or removed from the scene due to some unfortunate mishap.<br/>\n<br/>\nBLACK SIX ("Six For Gold")<br/>\nCan only be played to cover a Five, following the introduction of something gold, or a magnificent gift or reward.<br/>\n<br/>\nRED SIX ("No Gold")<br/>\nCan only be played to negate a Black Six. The gift, reward or gold item is either ignored entirely or removed from the scene due to some unfortunate mishap.<br/>\n<br/>\nBLACK SEVEN ("Seven For A Secret Never To Be Told")<br/>\nCan only be played to cover a Six, following the introduction of an event or rumour best not made known publicly.<br/>\n<br/>\nRED SEVEN ("No Secret")<br/>\nCan only be played to negate a Black Seven. The secret is either ignored entirely or else made known and made subject to public scrutiny.<br/>\n<br/>\nBLACK EIGHT ("Eight For A Wish")<br/>\nCan only be played to cover a Seven, following the introduction of an offer which promises rewards or success further down the line.<br/>\n<br/>\nRED EIGHT ("No Wish")<br/>\nCan only be played to negate a Black Eight. The offer is either ignored entirely or else retracted.<br/>\n<br/>\nBLACK NINE ("Nine For A Kiss")<br/>\nCan only be played to cover an Eight, following the introduction of a love interest and scenes of a romantic nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nRED NINE ("No Kiss")<br/>\nCan only be played to negate a Black Nine. The kiss is either ignored entirely or else the relationship quickly turns sour.<br/>\n<br/>\nBLACK TEN ("Ten For A Time Of Joyous Bliss")<br/>\nCan only be played to cover a Nine, following the nearing of a happy conclusion and the suggestion of a happy ever after.<br/>\n<br/>\nRED TEN ("No Bliss")<br/>\nCan only be played to negate a Black Ten. The bliss is either ignored entirely or else events conspire to cause the world to fall down around the character's ears.<br/>\n<br/>\nBLACK JACK ("Enter The Jackdaw")<br/>\nCan be played at any time, assuming there's an appropriate lull in the story. The Jackdaw is the youngest of the birds, trying to impress others, trying to make a name for itself, and generally well-natured, it may be depended upon to help, if occasionally demanding help in return.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake the pile in the centre of the table, shuffle it, and then deal one card randomly to each player (including yourself). You may then lay the pile back down and lay any card from your hand on the top of the new pile.<br/>\n<br/>\nRED JACK ("No Jackdaw")<br/>\nCan only be played to negate a Black Jack. The Jackdaw either fails to arrive or else is chased away.<br/>\n<br/>\nBLACK QUEEN ("The Crow Flies")<br/>\nCan be played at any time, assuming there's an appropriate lull in the story. The Crow is the lighter side to the brooding Raven, yet more focussed than the Jackdaw. The Crow will serve as a messenger, or conversely brings news, good or bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nPick another player. Exchange your hand with theirs.<br/>\n<br/>\nRED QUEEN ("No Crow")<br/>\nCan only be played to negate a Black Queen. The Crow either fails to arrive or else is chased away.<br/>\n<br/>\nBLACK KING ("Quoth The Raven")<br/>\nCan be played at any time, assuming there's an appropriate lull in the story. The scene becomes the court of the brooding Raven, who passes judgement on those before him. How he delivers his judgement is up to the player, but shouldn't result in the death of the naive young hero unless the player has no more cards in hand and wants to end the story that way, or else is suggesting the story continue with the dead man's soul wandering the afterlife (and maybe seeking a way to return).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe player can deliver justice of his own by giving one card to each other player.<br/>\n<br/>\nRED KING ("No Raven")<br/>\nCan only be played to negate a Black King. The Raven does not appear, or else his judgement is somehow overruled.<br/>\n<br/>\nJOKERS ("The Magpie's Nest")<br/>\nCan be played at any time, assuming there's an appropriate lull in the story. The black and white Magpie, the trickster of the family, reminds the young hero that it has no ties, no loyalties, except those affections it has for all the pointless and trivial things in life, the pretty sparkly things that make a person's life beautiful and impresses others.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlace all your remaining cards, in any order, on the pile. Then draw a card at random from the hands of each other player. Those things you steal from other players, to furnish the magpie's nest, become your new hand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174275/#Comment_174275" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T07:28:31+00:00" title="October  9, 2008  7:28AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2008 7:29AM by Hituro.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, here's my entry, still in time <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><a href="http://www.teuton.org/~stranger/GAMES/a_parliament_of_rooks.pdf" rel="nofollow">A Parliament of Rooks</a><br/><br/>yes it's rooks ... not ravens<br/><br/>Note ... not playtested at all, sorry.

(Five will probably be more than enough most of the time.)<br/>These rules for reference.<br/><br/><b>Set-Up</b><br/>Remove the queens (and jokers) from a standard deck of playing cards.  Discard the Queen of Hearts and deal the remaining cards to the three players.<br/><br/>      The Queen of Clubs represents Gentle Annie who has dominion over death, survival of the fittest, and combat fatality.<br/>      The Queen of Diamonds represents Morgan who has dominion over wealth and sovereignty.<br/>      The Queen of Spades represents Babs who has dominion over conflict, rage, and violence - but not that resulting in death.<br/><br/>Deal a nest of five cards to each player and set the rest of the deck aside.  <br/><br/>Finally, place the dice in easy reach of all of the players.<br/><br/><b>Game Play</b><br/>Game play takes place in five phases - each phase corresponding to both a stage of the customer's visit to the cafe and to a particular stage of thier life which the wait-goddess with prophecy about.<br/><br/>     After the customer is seated - make a prophecy about the customer's present<br/>     After the order is taken - make a prophecy about the customer's distant past <br/>     After the meal is served - make a prophecy about the customer's recent past<br/>     After the desert is served - make a prophecy about the hidden influences in the customer's life<br/>     After the bill is paid - make a prophecy about the customer's future-fate<br/><br/>Each phase, each wait-goddess plays a card from her nest and makes a prophecy based on the suit of the card and the phase.<br/><br/>     Clubs deal with death and survival.<br/>     Diamonds deal with wealth and sovereignty.<br/>     Hearts deal with romance and fertility.<br/>     Spades deal with conflict and violence.<br/><br/>Prophecies should build on and not contradict the true prophecy from all previous phases.  (See below for which prophecy is true.)  As a guideline, a prophecy should take 2 to 3 minutes to narrate.<br/><br/>Once all three wait-goddesses have made a prophecy, they each hand out one die to the prophecy they liked best - how they determine "best" is completely arbitrary.  They may also take one die for themselves if their prophecy card matched their suit (the queen in front of them).<br/><br/>After all dice have been allocated, the wait goddesses roll their dice and add the result to the value of the prophecy card they just played.  (Number cards are worth face value, royal cards - jack, queen, king - are worth 10, and aces are worth 1 or 10 if they match the suit of their character's queen card.)  The prophecy with the highest total is determined to be the 'true' prophecy for that phase of the customer's life.<br/><br/>The true prophecy-card remains in front of the wait-goddess who made the prophecy, face down.  All remaining cards are discarded and dice are returned to their starting position.<br/><br/><b>End Game</b><br/>After the final true prophecy has been revealed, the wait-goddess with the most cards gets to narrate what happens to the customer after they leave the cafe.  If there is a tie for the wait-goddess with the most cards, then the wait-goddess with the fewest cards gets to narrate instead.  Again, the narration must build on all the true prophecies that have been made during the game.<br/><br/><i>So now you know the secret of the Murderland Cafe and of the three waitresses who are always there.

Oh crap! It's Mr. Raven, head of the biggest organized crime syndicate in the world. And this is what he says:<br/><br/>\u201cEach of you are here because you have betrayed The Syndicate in your own, special way. We know I\u2019d be well within my rights to gun each of you down where you stand, drinking my wine, eating my canapes-- if I were that kind of man. But we both know I\u2019m <i>not</i> that kind of man, don\u2019t we? I\u2019m a kind, benevolent man. A <i>betting</i> man.<br/><br/>We\u2019re going to play a little game. Somewhere in this house, there\u2019s a duffle bag with two million dollars inside. Two of you lucky sons of bitches get to split the money between you. Unfortunately, the rest of you are going to have to die.<br/><br/>The rules are like this, see: you kids have one hour, just one. At the end of that hour, two of you had better be left standing, and you\u2019d better have found the cash. If more than two of you are alive, everybody dies. If just one person is alive, that person dies. If two people make it but haven\u2019t found the bag, well, they die too.<br/><br/>There should be some weapons around the house-- you know, a gun, some rope, a pipe, a candlestick, the usual. Oh, don\u2019t try to escape, or you\u2019ll die. See you in fifty-nine minutes.\u201d<br/><br/>Welcome to Murderland.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment"
