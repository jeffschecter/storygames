                    Welcome.<br/>
<br/>
You are here to see the end of my support of Forgian principles of design. Hereby I declare - through my very own arrogance - the Big Three dead.<br/>
<br/>
These questions are the very centre of what has been taught at the Forge. Although it is true that some very important principles of RPGs have been first formulated at the Forge and presented to the larger public, the conclusions drawn from these principles are often biased.<br/>
<br/>
The Big Three tell us that it is important, what the characters do and what the players do. The first question is kind of fuzzy and usually hard to answer. Often the answer summarizes at least some parts of the answers to question two and three. We can therefore say that the actions of charcters and players are aspects or at least symptoms of what the game is about.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with these questions is that one aspect which is very important in traditional design is completely ignored: The setting, the playground as Levi Kornelesen described it. Setting is usually considered an important aspect of RPGs. Often I hear, that people play RPGs because of the setting. Can they be wrong?<br/>
<br/>
No, obiously they can't. At least not, if there is no inferior way of play. But, you might say: "Look at the Power 19. The setting is right there. Question 4. It is not that bad."<br/>
<br/>
Well, let's read it again:<br/>
<br/>
<b>4. How does the setting reinforce what the game is about?</b><br/>
<br/>
As you see, the phrasing differs significantly from questions two and three. The difference is that this formulation discourages one answer: "You see, my game is about that setting, really."<br/>
<br/>
But this ignorance of one important part of RPGs is not only the problem with the Big Three. Although we can be sure that every game played by any gamer will contain characters' actions, players' actions and a setting not every RPG book contains all three and often some parts are changed by players. We therefore have to ask:<br/>
<br/>
<b><br/>
1. What do you imagine the players to do?<br/>
2. What do you imagine the characters to do?<br/>
3. How do you imagine the setting?<br/>
4. Which of these answers will you present in your game and which do you consider most important?<br/>
5. The inclusion of which techniques have you deducted from answers one to four?<br/>
6. Finally, how do you summarize, what your game is about?</b> </div>

                            I'd be interested to hear what a game about its setting would look like.<br>
<br>
If you answer "What is the game about?" with "The Setting," then what are the answers to questions two and three?  What do players and characters do in a game that is "about the setting"?                        </br></br></div>

<p>In a game that is about the setting, among other things, the players work to <em>exemplify and explore</em> the role of their specific characters within that setting, and how the parts of setting that are <em>also parts of their characters</em> interact with one another and with everything else contained there.</p>

                            That's all cool, Stefan, but for this reason you're ending your support of all things Forge-design? Isn't that like throwing out the baby with the bath water? So maybe you have discovered a new truth about "Forgian" theory, and you can contribute to that, improve it, and use the other stuff that is useful to you. I don't get it.                        </div>

<p>Josh, CtH seems to be <em>about</em> the players using the setting as a medium for advancement of their agendas, if I'm reading the summary copy correctly. Am I? Btw, why isn't there a screen-legible version?</p>
<p>Anyway, what do the Big Three have to do with your discussion here, 1of3? I feel like it is a confusing frame for this setting thing.</p>
<p>And, also, do you consider it possible for anything to be <em>more</em> important in a game than what the players do? Is it still a game, if this is overshadowed by some external thing?</p>

                            Hi!<br>
  I do not agree with everything the forge has to say. But if you really try and answer the Big 3/Power 19, it can point you to development efforts that are misguided and possibly rules/mechanics that are not apporpriate to YOUR game.<br>
  The gaff is, if I ask you "What is your game about?" and you answer, "Setting." Then you are just forcing me to ask you, "What is your setting about?"<br>
  Ultimately, Setting is just an elemant of the game that the players and characters interact with. It should reflect what the game is about. These design questions are simply tools that help push you in that direction. Like any tool, you have to take it or leave it based on your design goals<br>

<p>1of3,</p>
<p>You are high as a kite, man.</p>
<p>I can think of one game that's 100% about its setting that worked, and that's <em>RuneQuest.</em> There's lots of other games that appear to be about their setting, but they either (a) suck or (b) are really about something else.</p>
<p>Heck, look at <em>HeroQuest</em>. It should be about its setting - its setting is the biggest and oldest in RPG history (excluding m.f.ing Greyhawk, but whatever.) But it's not. Grab the book and you'll see that they couldn't even focus on the setting, ending up with a war between rabid individualism/tribalism and authoritarianism.</p>
<p><em>The Shadow of Yesterday</em> was originally supposed to be about its setting. (I secretly want to be Greg Stafford some day.) It's obviously not now.</p>
<p>Hey! I could be wrong. What games do you like that are about their setting?</p>

                            Hoy, :)<br>
<br>
I'm thinking here. Regardless of whether games about setting are good things or not.<br>
<br>
I really like this new Big Six things. I think, as questions, they are easier to answer than the Big Three, not to mention the Power 19.<br>
<br>
I would actually like to see a version of the Power 19 that starts with these Big Six, rather than the Big Three.<br>
<br>
So, there. :)<br>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

                            Shreyas -- in Actual Play, CtH is not as much about the character agendas as it may seem from reading it.  Most play involves toying with the setting, and only when the supplies start running low do the players start really focusing on the agendas/endgame.<br/>
<br/>
Also, are we talking about the setting as expressed in the game itself, or the setting as presented in the published material?  Cause those aren't the same thing.                        </div>

I think this is a good summary. Of course most games are <i>not only</i> about their setting but the more setting details there are and the greater the distance from known genre conventions the more the game can described as being about its setting. <br/>Games that come to my mind are Blue Rose, Nobilis, Mechanical Dreams and Das Schwarze Auge for those who know the German market. Of those Blue Rose and Nobilis I like and DSA is the content of my worst nightmares. So please, I have not said that games, where setting is a very central part, are my favorites.<br/>I like CtH but more for the creative competition then for the created setting.<br/><br/>I think I need a noun for "what the players do" and "what the characters do". I think the latter has been called "core story". The first I will call "style of play".<br/><br/>So naturally every game played by any group of players has setting, core story and a style of play. What we need to think about, is which details of these three component we present in our game and which we leave for the players to make up. <br/>Then there are those games that do not define any of these components but only present a collection of techniques, like FATE. I'm inlcined not to call those products games but toolboxes but that's just me.<br/><br/><br/>Adam wrote:

You see, I'm a poor guy with low self-esteem, so I need all the attention I can get. And it sounds more dramatic that way, doesn't it. ;D<br/><br/><br/><br/>Stefan                        </div>

                            I think I see a problem, here.<br/>
<br/>
When design aids like the Power 19 are asking about Setting, they do not mean setting in the convential sense. It's not "Middle Earth" or "the Star Trek universe" or "a pseudomedieval fantasy world with lots of stuff in it." Let's call these conventional settings Scenery. They're part of what the Big Model calls Color.<br/>
<br/>
Setting is a one- or two-sentence summary of the conflicts implicit in your world, stripped of most of the Color elements. It's equivalent to what Hollywood calls "high-concept"; it gives you an idea of what to expect from the story (in movies) or from play (in RPGs.)<br/>
<br/>
Scenery: Middle Earth<br/>
Setting: an overwhelming, corrupting source of Evil threatens to enslave or destroy everything, and only a few brave souls believe both that there is a danger and that they have a chance to make a difference.<br/>
<br/>
Scenery: Star Trek universe<br/>
Setting: an optimistic, scientifically-curious interstellar culture with a strong belief in the power of reason and a policy against meddling in the affairs of others is expanding through space and encountering other people's problems.<br/>
<br/>
Scenery: pseudomedieval fantasy world with lots of stuff and adventurers<br/>
Setting: in a rich, diverse world, the best way to survive is to improve yourself, and the only way to improve is to kill monsters and take their stuff.<br/>
<br/>
These are my own interpretations of those Settings, but that, as you will see, is part of my point. But see how, in each of these Settings, you have an idea of what to expect, given that you design Characters that tie into those settings? This is what Ron means by "Character + Setting = Situation".<br/>
<br/>
Now, then: "my game is about Middle-Earth" (or any other Scenery) is wrong in the same sense that "my game is about swords" is wrong. Your game may include Middle Earth or swords, but it's not *about* them. Games aren't about things, they're about what happens in an around those things. Plus, you can't even say "oh, I mean the Setting implied by Middle Earth", because you're really ducking the question... because the deep, dark secret here is that games are *always* about Setting. What people want to know is what your Setting *is*. Not your Scenery, that's just window dressing. They want to know what might happen if they play in your interpretation of Middle Earth, or Star Trek, or the pseudomedieval fantasy world filled with lots of stuff.                        </div>

                            If this is so and it helps to understand my complain, I gladly rephrase my third question to:<br/><br/><i>How do you imagine the scenery?</i><br/><br/>And yes, of course I want the scenery. That is my complain. Many people seem to forget, that the scenery is a valuable in its own right. I do not only want to play Agone because there is a dark, shapeshifting power who is the antithesis of Art to be defeated. I also play on Harmundia because birds sometimes catch fire, flying over the Widowlands.<br/><br/><br/>Clinton, I had the opportunity to play TSoY, yesterday. I enjoyed Near quite a bit - wonderful setting. From your perspective what is TSoY about, if it is not Near?                        </div>

<p>Reframing your original post with your newly formulated question, I am still left asking, you feel that there is <em>ever</em> a case where the scenery is more important than the actions played out on it, or on the players themselves?</p>

                            Shadows of Yesterday, for example. Well not, when the game is played, of course. The actions we had yesterday were absolutely central. <br/>
<br/>
But as for the written game, there is nothing but that setting (unless I have missed something). There is no reason for me to play TSoY other then Near. If I choose to play TSoY I do it because of the setting.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore the actions we took were absolutly dependent on the setting. I did not enjoy the game because I played a character who was betrayed for his services. I enjoyed to play that goblin who was not given proper respect for helping travellers in the swamps. The game did not help me to make a betrayed character. All it did was to give me the opportunity to make that character a goblin swamp guide.                        </div>

                            I'll just jump in and say that I have, outside of convention demos, never played TSOY with the stock setting.  I'm currently running a game set in summer-and-autumn period China, and recently played in a 3-session "samurai-punk" setting.  The game is made for kit-bashing.                        </div>

                            This is Story Games so I'm allowed to say stupid things, right?<br/><br/>Okay, even though I've never cracked open Jorune, I hereby nominate it as a game that's about the setting.<br/><br/>Also, I'll nominate Talislanta, which I only recently began to delve into after finding a cheap copy of the 2nd edition handbook. The game seems an ideal setting-as-playground. You've got all this *stuff*, in the form of a map, a jillion PC types, and some suggestive material about the past and present of the world, all supported (at least in the edition I hold in my hands) by a light-as-meringue system. Maybe I'd take the system and export it into another campaign. But I have a theory about why I'm digging Talislanta after avoiding it for so many years. It's that the boldly alien weirdness of the setting "decenters" the reader, prevents judgment based on preconceived notions of plausibility, and lets you believe that the system really is "how the world of Talislanta works". (Okay, maybe the inhabitants are unaware of the ability level mechanics...) Result: a game that basically begs you to fill in the blank spaces, in the course of play--either through GM/player improvisation (my favorite: player-directed GM improvisation), or if you must, via the sourcebooks.                        </div>
