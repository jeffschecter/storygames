It contained discussion of someone's SO creating elements of a campaign that featured an all female organization that had some function in preparing corpses.  There was something about souls being blocked and unable to continue their journey to the afterlife.  I've searched "female", "souls", and "corpse", and come up empty so far.  I really liked this idea and intended to write it down for my own campaign, but didn't get to it.  Anyone remember this thread?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61789/#Comment_61789" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-21T22:44:20+00:00" title="March 21, 2007 10:44PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, you can utilize Google's superior search capability by entering "site:story-games.com" as one of your search terms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
