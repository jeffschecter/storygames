I just watched The Bourne Ultimatum last night, and one recurring device really stuck in  mind -- the Improvised Escape.  Throughout the film, Bourne is being hunted by enemy agents, and makes use of everyday items to create diversions, improvise weapons, or create escape routes to evade his enemies.  Most of the Escapes are largely cleverness on the part of the screen-writer(s), but how great would it be if my friends and I could pull out the same cleverness at the gaming table?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm envisioning a pattern of play where one player places Obstacles in front of a Fugitive player, and the Fugitive player must quickly improvise an Escape.  The goal would be to entertain each other with cleverly described escapes. I personally think it'd be difficult to come up with crazy ideas on the spot for an entire session.  Ideally, you'd want rules that would enable players to improvise like Bourne does on-screen.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy solution:  A deck of cards, each with one everyday item (flashlight, coat hanger, fire extinguisher, Febreeze bottle, food processor, etc) listed on it.  As a Fugitive player, you would keep a small hand of these cards.  When confronted with an Obstacle, you play one or more cards from your hand, describing how your character uses each item to Escape.  Perhaps you earn a reward of some sort for each item used, with a greater reward for items that would be difficult to work into an Escape (like a pink rubber eraser).  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor flavor, you could change the content of the deck depending on the setting of game--add hookah for a game set in Cairo, bicycle for Tokyo, or Hummer for LA.  Or maybe players could write down some random items on index cards at the beginning of each session, so each session has a fresh mix of ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts on how to make this better, or how to do it differently?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo take this a step further:<br/>\n<br/>\nA few other Hollywood thrillers (like The Fugitive, Enemy of the State, Chain Reaction, etc. ) follow the same basic structure as the Bourne movies.  In each story, you generally have three characters/sides in conflict:<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Hunted - a person on the run, who is trying to prove his innocence/avenge himself/reveal the truth before the powers that be capture him.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Keeper of the Peace - on the side of the law, she pursues The Hunted because she believes he is guilty of his crimes and must be stopped for the greater good.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Conspirator - also on the side of the law, but he knows that The Hunted knows too much, and wants to eliminate The Hunted before he reveals the truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis could work as a three-player game, where The Hunted player doesn't know which Law player is the Keeper of the Peace and which is the Conspirator.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86483/#Comment_86483" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T08:37:07+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  8:37AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool idea.

However, if the Hunted chooses poorly and gives the Conspirator resources, the Conspirator can use those resources to help catch up to the Hunted.  This would represent all sorts of tips, evidence, or "I'm here, meet me" or similar such interaction that usually populates these movies.<br/><br/>Yes, if the KotP wins, one of the other players wins.  Both other players want the KotP on their side, but make it so the Conspirator can't mechanically help the KotP, only hinder the Hunted.  And the Hunted isn't sure which one of the other players is the KotP and which is the Conspirator.<br/><br/>You'd have three very neat, very different roles that are all bound up to the same situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RoninZombie" title="RoninZombie"><img alt="RoninZombie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RoninZombie">RoninZombie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86942/#Comment_86942" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T09:19:28+00:00" title="August  9, 2007  9:19AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great ideas!  Thanks for your input.<br/>\n<br/>\nlachek - I agree, one set of rules that works for each side (but used differently for each side) would be ideal.<br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Teapot - the Hunted identifying the Conspirator should be an important part of the game, and a bit of a gamble on the part of the Hunted.  I like Joshua's suggestion of the Hunted giving resources to Law players -- that could be a mechanism for the Hunted to feel out which player is the Conspirator.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoshua - I like your summary of the end-game goals.  What would enable the KotP to arrest the Conspirator?  Perhaps the KotP can choose to use the resources given by the Hunted in two ways:  either to close in on the Hunted or build a case against the Conspirator.  That's tetchy since the KotP knows from the outset that the other Law player is the Conspirator.  I guess there would need to be a tug of war between the Conspirator and the Hunted to prove which one of them is guilty to the KotP.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe both the Conspirator and the KotP can use resources from the Hunted to either Build a Case or Close In on the Hunted.  The Conspirator is trying to build a case against the Hunted, while KotP is trying to build a case against the Conspirator.  But to the Hunted player, it looks mechanically the same!<br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise, the Hunted would have two activities as well:  building a case against the Conspirator and escaping the traps of the Law players.  So each side could be almost the same mechanically, but each would a differently feel because of differing end-game goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86972/#Comment_86972" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T10:33:34+00:00" title="August  9, 2007 10:33AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2007 10:36AM by Josh Roby.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, so like: the Hunted sits there, looking at the two Law characters, and watches them put poker chips down in rows on the table, and give significant looks at each other.
