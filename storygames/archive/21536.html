I was having trouble getting some of my thoughts out with this.)<br/><br/>Something that's always kind of baffled me in the ttrpg community is exactly how much a large portion of the community is obsessed with emergent narrative and is against things like games that mechanize narrative planning because of it. I've seen a lot of people say that cutting emergent narrative is to them defeating the purpose of ttrpg.<br/><br/>(I should note, I'm not at all talking about stuff where the GM plans everything when I talk about planning and non-emergent play. I'm talking about collaborative stuff where the group plans the story together, structures it together, then explores it. Where the planning is playerside, and the campaign is playing through and expanding the plot outline everyone wrote together.)<br/><br/>And tbh I've just lately been trying to understand the train of thought, because for me, emergent narrative isn't at all rewarding, feels artificial, has a big risk of producing crappy fiction, and generally just makes play feel extremely casual on a level that for anything beyond short-form play (1-3 sessions) just generally makes me disengaged. <br/>(Which like, mind you, I'm not saying it's bad. It's just hugely not for me.)<br/><br/>So in my effort to understand, if you like and value emergent narrative, can you explain to me what about it appeals to you, what makes it important to you, generally why you like it?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470892/#Comment_470892" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-21T20:16:42+00:00" title="March 21, 2018  8:16PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2018 8:20PM by BeePeeGee.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to see <i>specific</i> story games/RPGs mentioned when someone gives example of emergent vs planned(?) narrative.<br/><br/>In my experience, the lines are quite blurred and distinction is not so easy. Especially, there are several dimensions involved:<br/>- In traditional RPG with a GM, a lot of the planning is hidden. So, what looks like emergent narrative to the players may as well be well disguised railroading by the GM.<br/>- System mechanics may have a great influence on what emerges, i.e. Fiasco games often imo finish in a similar place - even though theoretically players are free to spin it in what direction they want.<br/>- Players' background, competence and previous experience. Results are entirely different depending on a shared enthusiasm &amp; knowledge of a setting (i.e. Star Wars fans), experience with certain Indie/Freeform formats and trust &amp; experience of playing various other games in the past together.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm both happy with planned and emergent narrative - ideally an open structure that can go in unknown directions.<br/>That is actually the excitement of emergent narrative to me: <i>not knowing</i>.<br/>Not knowing where the story will go, what could happen. This is something that (currently) no computer game can truly provide.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470894/#Comment_470894" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-21T20:27:12+00:00" title="March 21, 2018  8:27PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For some examples like you asked for:<br/><b>Emergent Story-telling</b>: Apocalypse World, Monsterhearts, Dungeon World, Sorcerer, Blades in the Dark, the whole category of "play to find out games"<br/><b> Planned Narrative games</b>: Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine, Nobilis, etc, where narrative structuring and planning is a part of the game itself<br/><br/>And ye, that makes total sense.

I hadn't thought of it from that perspective before, and that makes it make a lot more sense. I've always liked the railroading type stuff in theory, but have been annoyed in the past with GMs who do all the work and don't let the players contribute. Because "railroaded" stuff to me feels more like a story (since stories have strict beginning, middle, end, follow dramaturgical structures and narrative devices, etc), whereas play-to-find-out stuff feels like a simulation of life, and I'm not interested in simulating life; I'm interested in simulating and creating stories. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470951/#Comment_470951" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-22T08:57:38+00:00" title="March 22, 2018  8:57AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" rel="nofollow">DInDenver</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The only players I know of that object to collaborating on story narrative flow are those that are more interested in "immersion."<br/><br/>Meaning they want to play their character and are only interested in the experience through the lens of their character's viewpoint.</p></div></blockquote>\nI have quite the opposite experience from roleplaying game discussions. You don't want to be in author stance ("controlling the story") if you prefer to play for immersion. You don't want to think of "what going to happen next" in terms of story making.

You don't want to be in author stance ("controlling the story") if you prefer to play for immersion. You don't want to think of "what going to happen next" in terms of story making.

FATE seems like one of them to me, because while it discourages lots of "plotting" by the GM, it also quite firmly says "This is who these characters are, and we're going to showcase that."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470964/#Comment_470964" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-22T14:16:51+00:00" title="March 22, 2018  2:16PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2018 4:00PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think that princess play (play focusing creatively in relishing your character) and the way plot is created in the game, or even if it has plot at all, are in any way logically contingent on each other. I think that traditional rpgs commonly combine princess play with GM plot railroad, but that's just cultural history of the form, not a logical necessity.<br/><br/>Technically speaking strong princess play doesn't even require a plot; any way to establish situation will do. A GM who plans a plot where the player characters get to "shine" (often in combat encounters) is one way to allow the PC to realize itself in a concrete situation, but as far as princess play activity is concerned, you could just as well let the players think up detached scenes and situations and play those, like children playing with toys do. "My turn, this time our characters are at a mall, being harassed by security guards. Show me how your character acts in this situation!"<br/><br/>On the other hand, I don't think that princess play is really compatible with the creative priority that used to be called "narrativism"; clear and elevated player commitment to a character concept as a static ideal does not go well with the notion of emergent reveal of theme. An example I often use about this is that the player who's really into the paladin-hood of their Paladin in a fantasy game usually does <i>not</i> appreciate it if the game puts them into a dishonorable situation that calls their honor to question. They want to <i>express</i> the character's honor, not <i>explore</i> it.<br/><br/>But plot - that's a side concern for princess play, narrativism, many other things. Plot is an overly elevated concern in rpgs in general, really, perhaps because enthusiastic author-GMs are so common. It's just a few specific modes of roleplaying where plot is an overriding concern.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470965/#Comment_470965" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-22T14:16:52+00:00" title="March 22, 2018  2:16PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2018 2:17PM by JasonT.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This may only be tangentially related to what you're asking here, but I asked what I think might be a similar question on G+ yesterday ("What's the appeal behind shared narrative authority?") and got a lot of really helpful answers from people. <br/><br/>Edit to add the link I forgot :-P  <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JasonTocci/posts/UXyXDBNwHmb" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/+JasonTocci/posts/UXyXDBNwHmb</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470967/#Comment_470967" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-22T14:51:16+00:00" title="March 22, 2018  2:51PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Airk" rel="nofollow">Airk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>He said "The people who object to collaborating on story narrative flower are those that are more interested in immersion" - that is "The people who want to be immersed in their character don't want to deal with planning".</p></div></blockquote>\nI'm stupid.

Perhaps this is because no one can agree on what "immersion" is, perhaps not.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, I've heard people say that they "want to know how things will turn out, ahead of time, so that they can just play their character". This type of player might even really enjoy a heavily GM-led game (perhaps even a total railroad), because they just want to sit there and experience feelings in-character (or something like that).<br/><br/>I've also heard people say that they "can't immerse in a character if they can't make organic decisions as the character". In other words, if I have to always have in mind that the story is headed THIS way, and that there are constraints on what I can - and should, really - decide to do, then I "can't experience the game purely from my character's viewpoint. The other considerations intrude and destroy my sense of immersion entirely." For this type of player, open-ended decision-making ("playing to find out") is absolutely necessary for immersion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470976/#Comment_470976" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-22T16:25:32+00:00" title="March 22, 2018  4:25PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you use rules (or strong advice and plenty of time) for narrative planning, it shows you care for narrative structure.

There are a lot of "play to find out" games which aren't "simulation-of-life" <i>enough</i> for me!  Usually because at some point in play, the internal causality of the fiction is overridden by a rule.  A flow of virtual experience is one of my favorite things to get out of RPGs, but at the same time, if you lose yourself too far into it, it can lose all the benefits of a game and pick up all the nuisances of real life!<br/><br/>On the opposite end of the spectrum is a play style that I'd compare to workshopping/storyboarding.  I really enjoy that too!

(Maybe poets who work in strict forms care more. Maybe.) And most screenwriting guides are pretty explicit that the plot has to emerge from the characters or you get something less then engaging.<br/><br/>So, here's an example of a game that is highly structured even though it never makes it explicit (or even requires you to follow it): Lady Blackbird.<br/><br/>Lady Blackbird has a three-act structure, just like a screenplay! (Act One: escaping the Hand of Sorrow; Act II the Journey to Uriah; Act III the confrontation with Uriah). And the reason it works so well is because of the obstacles presented, and more importantly, the motivations of the characters.<br/><br/>Lady Blackbird wants to escape an arranged marriage and find her former love; her stakes are high, basically losing everything she cares about if she fails.<br/><br/>Naomi wants to follow Natasha, and take out Imperials.<br/><br/>Cyrus wants to get Natasha to Uriah...or maybe convince her to not go to Uriah. Either way he's following her.<br/><br/>Kale wants to follow Cyrus. Snargle is kind of along for the ride, and so it's natural they become the comic relief. (Kale and Snargle both have the most fertile ground to take the characters in different directions.)<br/><br/>The obstacles are obvious: escape the Hand, find someone who can give the course to Uriah, confront Uriah. But each provide a good breaking point and flow naturally from character motivation.<br/><br/>A note for fans of Harmon Circles/Monomyth: Lady Blackbird more or less starts at Spot #3: all the "introduce the characters in the normal situation" and "inciting incident" stuff happens on the character sheet.<br/><br/>Most AW games <i>don't</i> do that; they explicitly start at position 1,  introducing the characters. The inciting incident is what is emergent; the rest of the game &amp; MC advice push you to follow the character motivations.<br/><br/>...some random observations, YMMV <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470987/#Comment_470987" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-22T18:42:42+00:00" title="March 22, 2018  6:42PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2018 6:42PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome, <a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">@Aviatrix</a> ! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I wonder if railroad GMs could create pre-gens built to target their plots and thus make everyone happy?<br/><br/>Putting the status quo on the character sheet, and putting the inciting incident in the session/game premise pitch, are two techniques I'm very familiar with but have never paid attention to as parts of the Story Circle.

But there is another side to this : the other side is that events must <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lead</span> to a necessary and yet surprising conclusion. <br/><br/>I am now reading the OP part that is a counter-attack by someone who gets critics for their play style, and says : "Why the critics ? we are doing classical structured forms. You're producing grotesque nonsense." And it's true. Why the critics ? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(Kabbalah)" rel="nofollow">structure and dynamic</a> are not opposite, but complementary.<br/><br/>It's not just a question of aesthetics, but also of what "fits" you.  It has been shown that in RPGs more than any other games, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY7sXKGZl2w" rel="nofollow">the players complete the system with themselves</a>.<br/><br/>Coming back to earth, I suspect that Chuubo's arcs are collective GM prep.

The joy of this kind of narrative lies in discovery, in surprise, in the unexpected.<br/><br/>The second is the reward of functioning as both audience and creator at the exact same time. In a way, it's a bit of the opposite of what <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> was discussing earlier, in that I think the fun actually comes from operating in both of the modes he describes simultaneously (rather than favoring or swapping between one or the other). What I like about this is that it's truly unique to RPGs, and can only really arise through emergent story gameplay. (For me, if I want to be only the creator, I'd rather be writing something, and if I want to be only the audience, I'd rather be reading/watching/listening to something.)<br/><br/>My initial feeling about pre-planned narrative was, if you're going to do this, why wouldn't you just collaborate on a novel or a play or something instead, but <a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian%27s">@EmmatheExcrucian's</a> more detailed thoughts on this have convinced me otherwise. I definitely see what you mean about planning the narrative so as to focus on character &amp; immersion, and finding it more personally satisfying to know where a story is going. It seems like there's actually a lot of value in planned narrative gameplay, if that's your vibe.<br/><br/>Along with <a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix%27s">@Aviatrix's</a> comments, I think there's a lot of room for structure in emergent gameplay (and vice-versa). I'm a pretty hardcore structuralist when it comes to fiction writing (having read a lot about screenwriting, in particular). So I've noticed that, even though I prefer emergent gameplay, the narratives I'm in tend to pretty neatly follow a traditional 3-act structure \u2013 if only because I'm generally playing with groups that share this story philosophy. So as long as the structural stuff is sort of internalized, you don't even need it in the ruleset to play an emergent narrative that also has familiar story beats.<br/><br/>The FF Star Wars games are a decent example of this \u2013 you can play an emergent-story game where nobody knows what's going to happen, but because the setting is so culturally ingrained in everyone, players naturally try to mold what they're doing into a Star Wars Story\u2122. And that means specific story beats at specific points in the narrative. (Okay, now we get Imperial disguises, now we're at the part of the story where we have the dogfight) There's nothing in the rules about this, it just <i>happens</i>. Emergent <i>and</i> structured.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mneme" title="mneme"><img alt="mneme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mneme">mneme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471266/#Comment_471266" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-29T21:19:08+00:00" title="March 29, 2018  9:19PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2018 4:13PM by mneme.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is basically a continuum.<br/><br/>At one end is a non-negotiated D&amp;D game, or even more so, Over the Edge (1st edition) -- you have some basic agreement about an activity (adventuring and gathering loot, weird stuff), but very little agreement or consensus for the rest, or even structure that pushes things in a particular direction.  Instead, it ends up being a combination of private (and secret) preparation and improvisation, and the structure of the game mostly comes down to what happens, with how much it's like a story being accidental or based on people pushing it that way in the moment (and possibly sometimes being stopped by other people pushing a different way). (given where I put the other end, there's probably something even more chaotic/unknown on this end as an option, but this is where I'm putting it because it actually happens).<br/><br/>At the other end is a play or reading -- every bit of dialogue and action is pre-plotted and pre-determined, and play is mostly a matter of execution and interpretation of that script.  At this extreme, it can be very enjoyable, but isn't exactly what most people would consider a RPG, but it gets RPG nature fairly quickly as you move away from that extreme.<br/><br/>In the middle is...everything else.  If you have an outline of the plot and are playing to it, that's more pre-plotted than if people have set up core contracts abut are improvising around them (ie chuubo's).<br/><br/>But some things are hard to rate on this scale against others, except that we can see they're somewhere near.  Playing with mechanics like My LIfe with Master that push a particular plot structure but leave the execution and to a degree outcomes to players.  Playing the SHadows of Yesterday, where you've got a core structure -and- individual player promises, but one of the likely answers to some of those promises is to eventually overcome them (payout on a Key, if I'm being too vague).  The core plotline of Call of Cthulhu when played to the formula, where the players -know- that they're going to be presented with a mystery, and solving the mystery will lead to a fight or delve in which they may fail entirely, or succeed at the cost of their lives or minds.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471640/#Comment_471640" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-11T07:54:35+00:00" title="April 11, 2018  7:54AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I found that the way to amazing emergent story and narrative was letting go of story and narrative.<br/><br/>Think of the game materials as a world, not a script.

title=":)"/><br/></p></div></blockquote>\n<p>The word \u201ccreating\u201d in that sentence is what leads me to emergent narrative. With emergent narrative, we can experiencing stories <em>as we create them</em>. The map between experience and creation becomes tighter than other media, where there\u2019s a creation step (writing the script) and an experience step (watching or performing the play). Instead, with emergent narrative, every moment is experienced while it is created.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the advantage of emergent narrative. Now, do other media have advantages of their own? Yes. They can be tightly edited, and they can be tailor-made to traditional story structures (like Save the Cat or kish\u014dtenketsu). And can there be hybrid media, media that have some emergent properties and some pre-scripted properties? Yes. And (whether or not there are emergent properties) can the pre-scripting be collaborative and structured? Also yes.</p>\n<p>Much like a comic book has the advantages of readers being able to read at their own pace and of creators being able to work in smaller teams with smaller budgets, and a movie has the advantages of a soundtrack and of a more widely accessible and taught visual language, different media have different properties.</p>\n<p>And to me the key to the best emergent narratives was to not try to do narrative, only trying to do setup. That\u2019s when narrative happens. The gateless gate to the storyless story. It\u2019s like, if I want a flower garden, do I put petals in there? Or do I put seeds? Setups, obstacles, dilemmas, problems, conflicts, places, secrets \u2013 those are seeds. Tension, release, arcs, character growth, disappointment, elation, defeat, victory \u2013 those are petals. <strong>My job isn\u2019t to plant petals, it\u2019s to plant seeds.</strong></p>\n<p>To be clear, no-one is obliged to work with emergent narrative or even incorporate subsections of emergent non-scripted narratives into non-emergent pre-scripted frameworks.</p>\n<p>What is a game?</p>\n<p>A game is a protocol for a collaborative effort (or a solo effort, for those who choose to follow rules for themselves). For example, the following activities, among others, can be made into 100% valid &amp; legit games:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>creating a story script together</li>\n<li>realizing a pre-created story script together</li>\n<li>participating in a situation that creates an emergent, non-scripted narrative</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And depending on the protocol those games can look very different.</p>\n<p>\u201cEach player takes turn writing one sentence\u201d is different from \u201cI write all of Alice\u2019s lines, you write all of Bob\u2019s\u201d.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been away from Story Games for a while and I am happy to see so many new people here. It\u2019s gonna be awesome seeing what games you make, or what games you favor and how you approach them.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471672/#Comment_471672" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-11T16:11:00+00:00" title="April 11, 2018  4:11PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This got bumped right after I used the word "Emergent" in my "What are you playing" post, and I was given to wonder if I prompted a new thread that was already on a 2nd page since last night.<br/><br/>But no, it's been around a few days.<br/><br/>I don't concern myself too much about "story now" or "stoty later". Just different methods in my book. <br/><br/>But when I am watching a movie  or reading a story, if there is not something I didn't expect, I'm a bit disappointed. When player ideas or just general interactive chaos takes the game into an interesting direction I didn't see, much less planned, it's twice as fun for me than if I planned the cool scene.<br/><br/>Heck, I even enjoy it when player gameplay accidentally creates a situation that might be considered iconic or even cliche if it had been planned (like how my Dracula Dossier campaign ended with one PC sabotaging another PC's demolition attempts, which opened up the "post credit scenes" possibility that a third PC might emerge in a hundred years as the next "Dracula".)<br/><br/>I guess this is less of a factor in GM-driven games being a player. But when GMing a game, it elevates the enjoyment for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471674/#Comment_471674" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-11T18:34:17+00:00" title="April 11, 2018  6:34PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was very curious, as soon as I saw 2097 return to the forums (welcome back!!!) how long it would take Emma and Sandra (2097) to engage in dialogue, given their (as far as I can tell) almost diametrically-opposed interests in gaming.<br/><br/>Well, here it is, and it's very interesting to read.

We all sit down together and discuss what we want to do with the plot and the themes, where we want the character arcs to develop, and what the core beats of this story are. A lot of this discussion is also about how to weave together the ideas we each have. <br/><br/>The main game that we play (Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine) gives us mechanical support for this through it's Quests/Arcs mechanics that are about narrative planning, but once in a while we play other games, we just type this out and then print out copies of it so that we all remember what's up. <br/><br/>In play, there's a lot of discussion of "What is this scene doing narratively? Why is this here?" that generally if we don't have an answer for that, we skip over a scene. We use our outline as a guide for what kind of scenes to frame in play also, and play is largely focused on expanding and revising that outline, and learning how it happens instead of learning what happens. <br/><br/>Something we also discuss a lot in play is "If this thing here changes, will this mess up this other thing or not?" so that we can be super careful not to step on toes and not to accidentally mess up the story we're trying to tell because of some change that in the moment felt insignificant. <br/><br/>Does that help explain our approach to that style of play? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471693/#Comment_471693" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-11T23:43:57+00:00" title="April 11, 2018 11:43PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's super interesting, Emma!

We're also all very strongly on the same page, so that kind of vetoing very very rarely happens. <br/>Also, we don't really do big metaplot stuff, so basically everything is just character arc stuff, so there's not much of any conflict, and a lot of our planning is figuring out how to weave the character arcs together. <br/><br/>A good example is like say for instance the story of my group's current campaign (which we're using Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine for). I'm playerside in this campaign.<br/><br/>I'll just summarize the first act (which was the first like 6 sessions) in extremely condensed form to give you an idea. <br/><br/>So my PC's arc in the first act was the story of her finishing out the last few months of high school and really being hit with all the stress of the fact that she's about to have to be an adult, and feels extremely unprepared for it. Which was a lot of her doing child-like things and then processing the fact that she's on the verge of a paradigmatic shift in her life. A big part of her story there revolved around her high school friend group and things imploding after a bunch of really messy stuff involving my character mishandling things with her best friend (who was in love with her), and through all of that basically being pulled into finding new friends, who she ends up discovering are far better friends and far better at supporting her than her old friends were. <br/><br/>The story of the other PC during the first act was about her protecting a girl who ended up her best friend, trying to find ways to make friends despite the fact that she's a neurotic mess who has trouble connecting with people, and dealing with the complex politics in the delinquent culture of the school surrounding the power vacuum caused when their leader disappeared several years ago. <br/><br/>I came up with my part of that on my own, and the other player came up with her part of that on her own, and then when we sat down to outline, we discussed what we wanted, and then a lot of our discussion was figuring out how to connect those two stories.<br/>We ended up connecting them through her PC and my PC becoming friends in the wake of all the complicated and stressful stuff going on, and her PC being a part of the friend group that my character fell into, with my character being one of the few people who knows how to handle her character's neuroses, because my character is also mentally ill.<br/><br/>Is that a helpful snapshot of how our outlining stuff kind of works? I could realistically expand it and go into our outline material for the rest of the campaign, but I felt like it would be easiest to just explain the first part, so that my post wouldn't be massively long and unreadable, you know?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471702/#Comment_471702" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-12T00:47:44+00:00" title="April 12, 2018 12:47AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great examples, thank you!<br/><br/>But I'm particularly curious about how much you nail down in advance - not what happens in play, but what you have written or set before you even start playing.

Her story is just a lot slower-burn/slower setup.<br/>Her story also follows a lot of the structures of that type of character like you're describing because the character is very much carried along by her circumstances, but playerside we have those circumstances very much planned out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471707/#Comment_471707" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-12T01:34:42+00:00" title="April 12, 2018  1:34AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I'm very interested in exactly how - and how much! - "we have those circumstances very much planned out".

While dealing with all of this complicated hero stuff, she's also having to defend her friends from a bunch of miraculous and dramatic threats, which really sets her on the path of being a real hero in her own right, instead of just following in the footsteps of her mentor like she's been doing. <br/>This culminates in her going on a big quest to save the world and protect her friends from a snake goddess who's trying to drown everything in basically chaos and madness. She kills the snake goddess, but the whole process ends up with her being permanently marked by the snake goddess, which makes her into somewhat of a monster, which prevents her from being close to her friends, and prevents her from being able to go back to the small town that she realized is realistically a home for her because the guardians of the town see her as a monster since she carries the snake goddess's taint. So then after realizing which direction her life needs to go in, she gets separated from everything she cares about and forced back into the politics that aren't what she wants from her life, until at the end her friends come and find her, bridging that distance by coming to her. <br/><br/>Which is tied in with the rest of my character's arc, which is that she gets assigned by her family to plan and organize a festival at the shrine, which she gets hugely stressed out over, but then manages to do, and through it she realizes that she's a lot stronger and more adult than she realizes she is. <br/>Then she meets her mother (who she had never met before), who is a being of lies, basically, who had years ago sealed away some great cosmic principle in a glass prison but has since realized that she made a terrible mistake by doing that, and she enlists my character to help her right that wrong and free the cosmic principle. Which leads them into conflict with my character's mom's superpowered nihilist ex-girlfriend, who is trying to stop them from freeing the cosmic principle, and eventually they end up prevailing, but it also turns out that my character's mom was using her to her own ends, and she ends up betraying my character, who from the whole experience learns that she trusts people far too easily and needs to learn to stop doing that, because trusting too easily ends up with her getting hurt.<br/>After the whole adventure with her mom though, she kinds of ends up with a taste for adventure, so she joins the other PC (who is by this point her girlfriend) on her quest to fight the snake goddess, which leads the two of them onto a big adventure where they go sailing across the basically ocean and see the world, and my character just kind of has a really fun and exciting time while she supports her girlfriend through her huge "time of troubles" where she's fighting and being corrupted by the snake goddess. They end up separated for reasons I explained in the explanation of the other PC's story, and then back at home my character starts searching for ways to be reunited with her girlfriend, which leads her to create a piece of magical glasswork (because my character is a glassmaker) that she imbues with the wish that she and the other PC could see each other again and be together again, which then ends out the campaign with the two of them finding each other again and being reunited. <br/><br/>This all gets written down. In Chuubo's in particular, this whole drafting process is mechanized into the game, and those beats and symbols and stuff that I described are all things that you gain XP for doing (with XP being used to advance the story). <br/>So ye. It's all written down, and typically for us is all mechanized into the game. \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Paul, read Chuubo's.

Chuubo\u2019s way of resolving this is moving some of the player agency from the play step to the arc-creation step. Whereas Dramasystem\u2019s way of resolving the tension is replacing the specific-event arcs with tone-and-power-shift arcs.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\nMhm. Chuubo's is really big on structuring things around really strong dramaturgical structures, also, which makes playing to the pre-planned story arcs and playing the character the same thing, because you crafted the story specifically for the characters in specific, and wrote it to the specifications of the story that feels right for them. <br/>There's also the fact that the setting runs on story logic, so those dramaturgical structures aren't something meta in Chuubo's; they're directly a representation of how the world the game takes place in works. Things follow dramaturgical structures because in the setting, that's how life works. It's cosmic laws.<br/>Which something I find so interesting and cool, because basically it makes all the narrative mechanics completely diegetic (sp?), and there's no way that someone could argue that different mechanics would suit the setting better like you see people argue with some other narrative games, because narrative mechanics are the way to accurately simulate the world that is Town.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471738/#Comment_471738" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-12T07:51:47+00:00" title="April 12, 2018  7:51AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2018 7:53AM by 2097.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it has definitely found ways to resolve what in other settings/systems would be tension.

A lot of it very very much does come from the desire and interest in character-acting.<br/>And realistically, with my group, if someone didn't want to do acting in their play, we wouldn't be playing with them. <br/>However, in the hypothetical, they would definitely be missing out on most of the fun, because character acting is like... all of our play. They'd just be sitting there watching while we all did really intensive acting stuff for 4-5 hours. <br/>My group's campaigns are pretty much 100% dialogue scenes, so if someone didn't want dialogue scenes, they would have nothing to gain from playing with us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471977/#Comment_471977" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-15T02:06:53+00:00" title="April 15, 2018  2:06AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2018 2:07AM by Paul_T.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, cool! That was my guess: the main appeal of this playstyle is for "actor types" - you get to portray characters doing things, and knowing what's coming up helps portray them and build towards the right moments. It's kind of a little like getting to write your own play, and star in it, too. Makes sense.<br/><br/>I've seen gamers that go entirely the opposite way, too: their play is very cerebral or structural, but no one is interested in putting on an accent for a character, portraying them physically, or acting out dialogue. It's all about the next plot point, seeing where things are going, and finding out what's around the corner. At the same extreme are some... let's call them "introverted immersionists", for whom the inner experience of the character is really more important than showing anything to others. <br/><br/>Most of us live somewhere in the middle, of course. But, notably, for anyone who is really interested in "making decisions <i>from a character's perspective</i>", knowing what's going to happen next ruins the whole point of roleplaying for them, since now it's way too hard to pretend you <i>don't know</i> - now it's work instead of play. And the same goes for people who are interested in "<i>making decisions</i> from a character's perspective": the whole point of play is to be surprised (or to discover) which way the story is going to go. Knowing how the story arc turns out means there's no point in playing at all - it's been "spoiled".<br/><br/>I've never played with a group of "character actor"-oriented roleplayers, although I've been in groups that had on or two plenty of times. It would be fun to see this kind of thing in action with a group where everyone supports it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471979/#Comment_471979" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-15T02:44:50+00:00" title="April 15, 2018  2:44AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the writing your own play and starring in it thing is extremely accurate! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/>I've tried to convey that same thing in a lot of different ways, and I'm tbh surprised that I hadn't come up with the "writing your own play and starring in it" comparison before, given my background in theatre.<br/><br/>I've heard stories of the "introverted immersionist" types, but I've never actually encountered them in play myself, tbh. <br/><br/>And yeah, it definitely doesn't work for people who value all the decision-making, although they do get some of that decision-making; it's just done up-front instead of in the moment. Which I know for that group is likely extremely different. The decision-making people are the type who are super super well-suited to "play to find out what happens", so it's not surprising that styles where you're playing to find out how it happens instead of playing to find out what happens wouldn't work well for them.<br/><br/>I'd never been in a group that's all character actor roleplayers until I ended up with my current group a few years ago. I was always one of those lone character actors in a lot of groups, and I always ended up really frustrated because character actor stuff really requires multiple people doing it for you to be able to accomplish everything you want as a character actor roleplayer, since you need people to bounce off of and interact with or else you're just monologuing (which from my experience, many groups aren't happy with).<br/><br/>My group and I are going to be putting out some podcast-type stuff of us playing when we get around to editing the raw audio and figuring out ways to fix with editing software some of the volume issues we have in the raw audio, so when we get that put together, I could send you some examples of it in action with a group where everyone supports it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471985/#Comment_471985" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-15T07:21:11+00:00" title="April 15, 2018  7:21AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2018 7:21AM by Rickard.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say it's similar to being a game master who seeks high player involvement.<br/><br/><a href="https://wiki.fisktank.nu/doku.php/2017_-_week_11" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.fisktank.nu/doku.php/2017_-_week_11</a><br/><br/>Anticipation, Sense of Wonder, (sometimes) Being Sadistic, Flow + Engagement, Shaping the Setting.<br/><br/>You never know where things are going, and being part of a team experience to collaboratively create something can be a rush by absorbing the energy from the other participants.

That clears it up. I'd love to hear a transcript of the group's play (although the part I would be interested in is the negotiation of "what will happen", not the actual acting out of scenes).<br/><br/>I love how this thread is bringing out unexamined assumptions and showing a variety of approaches to roleplaying. That kind of thing is really healthy for the hobby, I think. And, on a personal level, learning about allows me to be a better player, since I may be better able to fit in with groups who have different preferences from mine.<br/><br/><i>(Emma, I also find the "introverted immersionist" slightly baffling, but they definitely exist. I think that most realize, sooner or later, that their own contributions to the game matter for those around them, and so learn to externalize more of their experience of the character. However, it's definitely a thing people like doing. Here are two examples:<br/><br/>* There are LARPs which are written for people who do not interact with each other - for example, sitting in a room in silence with your eyes closed, or sitting in a closet by yourself.<br/>* There are a few people - even on this forum - who are really particularly interested in "solo roleplaying": playing RPGs by themselves, without an audience or other participants.

I also used to do it a lot for thinking out backstories, because that was during an era where I was really intensive on the backstory because I was trying to make my backstory have enough hintings of an arc in it that the GM would notice and hopefully give me some semblance of the story I wanted because the backstory made it clear where the character was headed, you know?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472181/#Comment_472181" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-17T20:48:14+00:00" title="April 17, 2018  8:48PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fascinating!

(I'm actually barely in this clip)<br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LNK_uXl5XTx1vsN258nXTAj_4m7Em0U2/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LNK_uXl5XTx1vsN258nXTAj_4m7Em0U2/view?usp=sharing</a><br/>Hopefully the link works. <br/><br/>(To give a bit of context on that clip's role in the narrative, basically, Sora was fighting the guy she's in love with, who is a being of the void who is forced by fate to be trying to destroy the world, and Sora is forced by fate to fight and kill him, but in the whole process of their conflict/romance, Sora had made him realize that the world is beautiful. This was a fantasy sequence during their fight that got the emotional heart of that fight, and where they were in this shared unreality of their theoretical life together if fate didn't force their hands into this conflict. This happened while Sora was unconscious and dying, and then led into Sadie [my character, who is Sora's girlfriend] saving Sora's life through force of will, which then led to Sora killing the guy she's in love with.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472797/#Comment_472797" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-24T08:24:17+00:00" title="April 24, 2018  8:24AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for the example.

When I'm improvising and losing myself in the character, also cool... but then having to suddenly <i>stop</i> doing that because some other factor says so -- that's super jarring for me.<br/><br/>I played a Montsegur 1244 spin-off recently where I reacted to a certain situation in-character in a way that couldn't stand because it needed to wait for Act 5.

And like, I would love to see scholarly-type stuff on the "play to find out how it happens" playstyle, but I'm not a scholar so I have no real idea where to even begin on trying to scholar-ize it, if that makes sense.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472992/#Comment_472992" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-28T06:36:18+00:00" title="April 28, 2018  6:36AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LNK_uXl5XTx1vsN258nXTAj_4m7Em0U2/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LNK_uXl5XTx1vsN258nXTAj_4m7Em0U2/view?usp=sharing</a><br/>Hopefully the link works. </p></div></blockquote>\nNo, it doesn't anymore. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472993/#Comment_472993" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-28T06:40:50+00:00" title="April 28, 2018  6:40AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shit, I reorganized my google drive recently and stuff got messed up.<br/>Here's a new link: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F3JtGI7f9st03YKW4axOL4O3ARzU_3at/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F3JtGI7f9st03YKW4axOL4O3ARzU_3at/view?usp=sharing</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21536/what-exactly-is-the-appeal-of-emergent-narrative/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21536/what-exactly-is-the-appeal-of-emergent-narrative">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21536/what-exactly-is-the-appeal-of-emergent-narrative/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21536/what-exactly-is-the-appeal-of-emergent-narrative/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F21536%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F21536%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
