Lots and lots and lots of traditional lore has developed about the monsters and how to fight them - there are songs and stories and children's rhymes and weaving patterns, and these get traded among the different tribes, who are mostly at peace with each other but at war with the monsters (but, people being people, sometimes are at war with each other). <br><br>A high oral culture tends to generate a complex language with lots of built-in error checking in the grammar, so the languages are complicated to learn and have a lot of tenses and irregular verbs. The poetic language also preserves an archaic, even more elaborate version, and because this is how people remember how to protect themselves from monsters they are highly motivated to keep it unchanged. There are cultural specialists who spend their lives learning the poems and stories and repeating them wherever they travel.<br/><br/>And the society has rules - that link of Selene's to the article on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/magazine/13Psychology-t.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all" rel="nofollow">the moral instinct</a> would be a good place to mine for ideas, and also Simon's <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7789" rel="nofollow">Generating Culturally Rich NPCs</a>. Harm, fairness, community, authority and purity are the five moral spheres talked about in the article, if you want to jump to the meat. The rules of this society are, again, largely about preserving them from the monsters. So, hmm:<br/><br/>* A human killing a monster is good, a monster killing a human is bad, a human killing a human is bad, a monster killing a monster is good (because it means we don't have to).<br/><br/>* Everyone needs to subordinate their own desires to protecting the community from the monsters, and it doesn't matter if this isn't fair.<br/><br/>* Listen to your bards, they know how to protect us and how to kill the monsters.<br/><br/>* Listen to your fighters, they protect us. Obey them when they tell you to do something.<br/><br/>* Listen to your clerics, they know how to heal us and protect us.<br/><br/>* Despise wizards, they got us into this mess. But use them if you have to.<br/><br/>* Any sin can be purified with fresh monster blood.<br/><br/>And so forth.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174463/#Comment_174463" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-10T09:03:15+00:00" title="October 10, 2008  9:03AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Incidentally, I can't help but misread this thread title as "I need help making more advanced sausages".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174464/#Comment_174464" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-10T09:17:34+00:00" title="October 10, 2008  9:17AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On that note, can anyone give me ideas for more advanced food, for people who are frequently on the move?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174465/#Comment_174465" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-10T09:22:05+00:00" title="October 10, 2008  9:22AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2008 9:30AM by Jacob.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe they've perfected Raise Dead type magic to the point where it is even more commonplace than it already is in DND.

If you mean it as "improved" then that's a value judgement, and the answer depends on what kind(s) of culture, or what kind(s) of art, you would view as being an improvement on the kind(s) we already have. There are obvious answers  - perhaps "more abstract" for the art, and "more permissive" for the culture - but it's inherently a value judgement thing.<br/><br/>If by advanced you mean "looking at 21st Century life and extrapolating based on likely trends" well, that's got no value judgement in it, but it is pretty tricky to do, especially with the stipulation that the likely future has to resemble tribalism. Would be a fun discussion as to where the culture and art of the future is heading, but I need to know that's what you want the thread to be about first.<br/><br/>So which is it, prediction or value judgement?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174471/#Comment_174471" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-10T09:40:27+00:00" title="October 10, 2008  9:40AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't know if this helps, I created a "post-industrial primitive society" (post-industrial as in post-the-best-magic-can-do-for-society) for my 3.5 game at one point.<br/><br/>I pictured them as "well along Maslow's hierarchy" of needs satisfaction, a society not concerned about having enough food but moved onto food as quality and art and social significance; a society in which crime was impossible in that no action could be carried out and the responsible party not identified if necessary; a society in which there was no single hierarchy of power or authority rather each individual's counsel was valued based on their record and different people were most persuasive on different subjects etc.<br/><br/>Superficially, a people with few possessions but who were fascinated with the detailed inscription/crafting of items, performance artwork and finely crafted personal goods rather than monuments etc.  Speech and communication integrated with body movement and posture (you see two slightly clad people seeming to mime to each other as they pass, neither breaking the conversation they are each having with another).<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174475/#Comment_174475" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-10T10:29:09+00:00" title="October 10, 2008 10:29AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2008 10:29AM by Brand_Robins.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, <br/><br/>What about using some of <a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/" rel="nofollow">John Robb's ideas about the weaknesses of centralized networks</a>, and have these humanoids be the survivors of the crash of some kind of global system that went kaput? Having learned that you can't survive a huge enough crisis if you put all your eggs in one basket, they've developed local, tribal, repetitive structures not because they're simple, but because they've found out that flexible, dynamic, interlayering structures based on personal relation and local decision are more durable over the long run? <br/><br/>As part of that shift they'd put a lot of emphasis on relational ties, both of blood and sex, but also possibly by service organization, friendship level, clan and club affiliation, and so forth. In their culture it isn't what you have in terms of good, or what you have in terms of nebulous and oft invisible "spending power" but who you know, how you know them, and how much they "owe" you based on who you are to them. They'd probably have dozens of words for blood relations (not just mother, father, uncle, aunt.. but specific words for "mother's brother's son" vs "Father's brother's son"), for different types of friends ("Blood companion" vs "fair weather companion"), and for different types of social relations. <br/><br/>Their complexity and advancement could thus come from the very thing that makes them look simple in the eyes of the PCs -- they look like simple tribals, but in reality they have a dynamic, stable, durable society that puts its effort into a vast array of what we might call "grassroots" organizations, rather than trying to build up monolithic centralized societies. <br/><br/>Also, who knows how nuanced their religion is? What happens to a culture when the emphasis is progressive but placed on the happiness and spiritual life of people rather than the material life? Not medievalism here, that's conservative spirituality, but a culture that wants people to be happy here and hereafter (if they have a hereafter), but doesn't think the body or the having of possessions is the primary way to achieve that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174478/#Comment_174478" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-10T11:11:59+00:00" title="October 10, 2008 11:11AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan,<br/><br/>There are many other good points brought up here, and I don't know if I'm rehashing information from the linked articles (which I didn't read), but:<br/><br/>1. I like Mike's ideas about language. A savage explaining how a simple phrases or a couple of words in their language carries so much meaning, so much information, so much artistic or moral connotation, can make their whole culture seem very "advanced", if done right.<br/><br/>2. An obvious "advance" seems to be in terms of the moral beliefs and societal structure. For instance, a culture where everyone is fair, kind, yet still strong (to survive monster attacks or whatever) goes a long way. Imagine the shock of discovering that, "no, we don't have theft/murder/whatever". They are all "above" those things; have evolved beyond them. They don't need laws, they don't have war, etc. They never get angry or give way to "base" impulses.<br/><br/>3. Another way to demonstrate the savages' advanced superiority is to show how well they perceive and understand the world. If, upon meeting the PCs, they can divine intent, background, etc, from simple observation, cannot be lied to, etc, that will make them appear very advanced.<br/><br/>4. Also consider very fine control over the body--like yoga, meditation, the ability to store food somehow in the body (or some other way to go for a long time without needing food), the ability to stop one's heart beating, hold one's breath for long periods, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174480/#Comment_174480" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-10T11:15:39+00:00" title="October 10, 2008 11:15AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about swift and brutal punishment for Prisoner's Dilemma defectors?

No one to suggest that tribalism <em>makes them</em> more advanced?  I know, this gets to my personal favorite hobby horse, but I should think that by now the notion of unilateral social progression has suffered enough blows that as instinctive as that dichotomy remains, it shouldn't take too much consideration for it to implode.<br/><br/>In terms of medicine and health, general knowledge (both gathering new knowledge and retaining old knowledge), quality of life, etc., etc., most any tribal culture on Earth you care to pick will appear at least as "advanced" as our modern society (and light years beyond your average medieval European society) if you give them an honest examination.  If you want an Algonquin spin (which would give you that Indian feel), see Evan Pritchard's <em>No Word for Time</em>.  For a more philosophical (specifically, phenomenological) bent, David Abram's <em>Spell of the Sensuous</em> works well.  Graham Harvey's <em>Animism</em> has a lot to offer, though for the serious academic, nothing tops Tim Ingold's <em>Perception of the Environment</em>.  Any of these will help you begin to understand the sophistication of philosophy and culture just among the surviving tribal cultures on Earth.  Your medieval characters would no doubt see them as savages, but if they got to know them, they would invariably come to respect them, admire them, even try to join them.<br/><br/>Historically, the early years of colonization of the New World put Europeans from a very similar world in contact with such "savages," and the threat of large-scale abandonment loomed so large for the colonial powers that it shaped much of the early history of Europeans in the New World.  Roanoke left ample evidence that they joined the native population, the First Anglo-Powhatan War began over the flood of Jamestown colonists abandoning the colony to join the Indians, <a href="http://www.is.wayne.edu/mnissani/cr/Sachem.htm" rel="nofollow">the spirit of independence and freedom that eventually led to revolution came primarily from the Iroquois</a>, and as J. Hector St. John de Crevecoeur wrote in <em>Letters from an American Farmer</em>, "There must be in the Indians\u2019 social bond something singularly captivating, and far superior to be boasted of among us; for thousands of Europeans are Indians, and we have no examples of even one of those Aborigines having from choice become Europeans!"  The decided one-sidedness of the flow\u2014the Europeans who "went native" in such a flood that the powers of Europe took notice, and at times went to war and instituted laws to stop it, while right through the 1800s Indians chose to die rather than become "civilized"\u2014says, I think, a great deal about the dichotomy of tribalism and "advanced" society.<br/><br/>So, I would say that your problem doesn't really exist at all.  Base your savages on real savage cultures, but <em>really</em> examine them.

You can look at actual tribal societies, all of which were advanced far beyond the "savage" labels the ethnocentric societies gave them.  You can go back to Rome and look at their contemporary "barbarians".  For a quick, easy, and entertaining overview, I'd recommend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Jones'_Barbarians" rel="nofollow">Terry Jones' Barbarians</a> (you can get it from Netflix). The Celts and Persians are particularly interesting and likely useful. For example, the Celts were very egalitarian, something the patriarchical Romans found barbaric, and since they also sat on vast and advanced gold mines, so the decision to conquer and destroy them came rather easily.<br/><br/>The progression of art goes from ritual use to representation to emotion to abstract thought, but that's just painting, there's also methods of communication which have advanced art from still forms, to motion, to interactive. But if you put a Pollack painting on a cave wall, who would call that advanced? Are any of these advanced, or some simply new? Is art as ritual less valid than a art house movie or surrealist painting? Instead, you might look to how art is used in culture.  "Advanced" culture seems to have a higher permeantation of art, regardless of the form.  Theater, music and statues in Rome compare well to car radios, MP3 players, and TV when you remove technology from the equation.  But "primitive" societies often had art that was either limited to special people (the paintings of shamans, jewelry for leaders) or it was practical, either a decorated bowl or the power and magic communicated by a tattoo.<br/><br/>What does advanced language mean?  I can think of somethings, like simplified nomitives and small, flexible alphabets. But I might just think that because English is my primary language. And although I could point to Japan's ready adoption of romanization and English, at least in pop-culture, over their traditional alphabets, that could be nothing more than post-war influence (as China and Korea haven't jumped on the bandwagon with as much ferver). Plus, it's hard to communicate language differences when you're all playing in one language, unless you're a linguist or have lots of notes/ideas on the subtlety of meaning and phrases.  However, having an alphabet, and of course writing are ways that language is pretty concretely considered advanced.  Paper is a pretty basic technology given the right resources and industry structure.<br/><br/>Culture hinges on both of these.  First, something stratified and specialized is seen as more advanced.  If all the men hunt and fish and war, and all the women tend the camp and raise children and prepare food, it's going to look more primitive than if you have more organization.  Food being the core. You mentioned argriculture with nomadic existence, but without magic or making something up whole cloth, that just doesn't happen.  Though the idea that all primitive societies are nomadic is also a misnomer. It entirely depends on the food source. And agriculture is the development that most noticeably separates nomadic from settled. Not that you can't have nomads and implement some of the feeling of advancement, it's just that their primary food source is either going to be migratory or seasonal that requires nomadic life.<br/><br/>(to be continued)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174955/#Comment_174955" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-14T13:42:33+00:00" title="October 14, 2008  1:42PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued)<br/><br/>For more specifics, you should look at what you want to be advanced. In my book, free time is a big one. And that ties into specialization. If it only takes a small fraction of people to secure food for all, that will leave the rest with free time to develop other pursuits, leading potentially to specialization (like paper makers) and filling (or inventing) other needs. But there's health, social welfare, mores and enforcement, social interaction and structure, and name any broad political or social issue. One person's advanced might be another's social barbarism or immoral living. I mean, I don't really care how advanced "savage killing machines" might have progressed in other avenues, that would put them pretty low in my book (unless the emphasis really is on "first impressions").  Since you want to play with assumptions, you might even take different tracks with different tribes or factions.<br/><br/>One thing that's worth pointing out to help keep the image of primitive cultures is the size of a given population.  Smaller, intimate will help give that impression even if they have knowledge of advanced quantum mathematics, whereas putting them in massive Aztec cities will make them seem modern with a different style.<br/><br/>Also, another method that Jason touches upon, and you see in Sword &amp; Sorcerery of the likes of Conan, is that you don't have to push to hard to make them advanced.  Instead, you can highlight how "civilized" culture is weak and corrupt. Poverty, hunger, violence, crime weren't the same issues (at the very least, things like violence and hunger, when present threatened the whole group generally, and not just some "have nots"), and politics, greed, and corruption took form in much lower stakes. Bring the idea that civilized life is better down a notch or two, bolster your savages with some positive or hopeful advances we enjoy from civilization so that the end result is things are better now, and that should put you in a good spot.<br/><br/>And finally, racist stereotypes are just as bad when they are positive as when they are negative, so keep that in mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175257/#Comment_175257" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-16T23:28:30+00:00" title="October 16, 2008 11:28PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, there are, and have been, nomadic societies who practice agriculture.
