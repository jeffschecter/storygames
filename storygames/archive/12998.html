The line up was:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Sue Lee</b> as<i>Orbiteria</i>, an Inrepid Explorer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Tim Partridge</b> as <i>Althar the Magificent</i>, a Ghost Daredevil.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>John Ellis</b> as <i>The Atomic Shadow</i>, an Atomic Agent.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd <b>Phil Masters</b> as <i>Jarro the Metal Brain</i>, a Robot Detective.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first action scene began with the building that housed Rocket City's radiogram broadcasting company coming under attack from a gang of thugs armed with hyper-powered, back-pack mounted water cannons, literally flooding the building out. I also threw in a mysterious 'Slippery Shadow' darting about in the water, so that the Explorer and Detective had something they could deal with in a non-combative way. During this scene, and the 'Previously on...', we learned that the slippery shadow was an intelligent colony of psychic algae (the creation of a rare Red Neptunian criminal posing as Count Mironov, a Russian Industrialist, it was revealed towards the end of the session). The crew also rescued the newly crowned 'Miss Mars', whose parade float was passing by and was endangered as a result of a threat move, but they failed to save the flooded building when Disaster struck; Jarro launched himself at a window in order to break it and let more water out, but merely cracked the building hard enough for the pressure inside to pop it like a balloon!<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the interludes and tension scenes, Althar had his date with Miss Mars spoiled by Count Mironov's dealings and helped Orbiteria investigate a mysterious, green glowing artifact she had found on Neptune, whilst it seemed that the Atomic Shadow was in the pay of the Count and tried to interrupt the interrogation of one of the 'Hydro Men' by Jarro. This nicely set up the second and final Action scene with Threats of 'Labyrinth of Tunnels' leading from Rocket City to ancient ruins drowned under the artificial ocean, filled with a 'Hydro Gang', which spawned a 'Hydro Gladiator' to engage in mortal combat with the Atomic Shadow, whilst overall hung the chilling question of 'A Traitor in Danger Patrol?!'<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wrap-up involved Count Mironov (aka Mr. Red) using the psychic algae in the water supply to take over the mind of every human on Mars, using a mysterious, green-glowing Quantum Whale to power the countdown on his supercomputer! After a Herculean battle in which Orbiteria freed the Quantum Whale but was spirited away to another dimension by it and Jarro fought the computer in cyberspace, Althar finally dispersed the algae and broke its power over human minds with the help of his grenades.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring this game, I repeated a trick I had used at Conception earlier this year with the Alpha kit: whenever a player scored the hit that defeated any Threat, I presented the Threat card to them as a Trophy. They were given no mechanical benefit for this and were not told there would be any endgame regarding them, but it was great to see how pleased people were on being presented with a 'trophy' and it made for a great way of closing the game as the players counted up &amp; compared the trophies they had earned.<br/>\n<br/>\nThre things I'd like to say: first, the 'Detachable Flying Head' talent of the Robot really slows play down, as it effectively made Phil's turn twice as long every time he used it and he used it more than half the time. Second, lots of cool McGuffins popped up as result of all sorts of scenes and actions, but other than reincorporating them into the fiction, there wasn't a lot else to do with them, which seemed a shame as they would have made perfect fodder for Bonus dice. Finally, I was a bit thrown when one of the players got to Max Danger (it really should say something like that on the Role sheet) and I realised there was no longer any sort of reward for doing this in the Beta version. It felt odd that someone had achieved this and didn't get to mark it in any significant way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, a really fine &amp; splendid game, much enjoyed by all.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293069/#Comment_293069" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-12T10:05:38+00:00" title="September 12, 2010 10:05AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like fun, James.  I love the water cannons and the Quantum Whale (!)  "A Traitor in Danger Patrol?" is a great mystery.<br><br>I've found the Detachable Flying Head to be a little problematic at times too.  A version that used Power tokens might be preferable so that it might only be employed once or twice a session.  It might need to be boosted in potency to compensate though.<br><br>I think there's enough going on during a Danger Patrol session w/o having to add McGuffins as bonus dice mid-session as an explicit rule.  But I also don't think it's out of the spirit of Danger Patrol for the GM to simply apply extra hits due to re-incorporation of cool McGuffins.  If, in your mind, you had a Elite Threat as needing 9 hits before it's taken out but a player re-incorporates pieces of the fiction with cool narration and gets to 8 hits on that Threat, I absolutely would eliminate that Threat and say "Bravo, Althar!  Your cunning stratagem has carried the day!"<br><br>I think being at 3x or 5x bonus dice at the end of the Danger Meter is pretty rewarding as it stands.  My scenes are generally close to ending around the time any character reaches the end of the Danger Meter, if not before.  It's a bit like a scene-pacing mechanism in that way.  If a hero is pegged at the top of the Danger Meter and the scene keeps going for a while, I'd say there are other issues.  They're just trying not to get vaporized at that point and the scene has probably already gone on long enough.<br><br>I'm going to use Trophies for my next playtest.  I love stuff like that.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
