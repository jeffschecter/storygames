My my, what a drastic change that decision has made on my gaming habits and philosophies.  Needless to say I'm totally hooked .It started with Weapons of the Gods, then I discovered Dogs in the Vineyard, from there Burning Empires and it was all over. I could never go back to running D&amp;D game after D&amp;D game. I had found The Awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, like a few of you I have also decided to start up a podcast, and in just a few more weeks I'll have everything I need to get that going. It doesn't seem like you can have an indie gaming podcast without designing your own game as well, but the very idea seemed insurmountably intimidating. As time went by I've warmed to the idea more and more, and was just waiting for that little idea to lodge in my brain that I couldn't get rid of.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I think it hit me Saturday.  I was talking to a friend who'd moved away when he informed me of the sad news that he'd be moving back to my neck of the woods due to some new health problems.  They don't know for sure, yet, but he might have 5 years to live. This guy's just never caught a break. Near-fatal cancer at 17, lost his leg at 18, and now a heart condition that might have been caused by the chemo. It's a rotten deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got to talking about how he'd have to go through all the "preparation" of his friends and family if things turn south, again.  That's when it hit me. <br/>\n<br/>\nTerminal: The Game of Saying Goodbye.  I brought up just the title alone and my friend immediately said "You have to do this."<br/>\n<br/>\nHoly crap, though. Talk about a game that'll make it on people's "I'm scared to play this game." list.  Talk about a subject matter that, if handled poorly, could be incredibly hurtful and offensive.  But, the more I think about it, the ideas form and coalesce and it seems more and more doable every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo tell me story gamers: am i crazy? Am an an asshole for even considering a topic like this? Has this already been done and I just haven't seen it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any input on this subject,<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\n(edit: cleaned up some of the text)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160618/#Comment_160618" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-04T12:12:33+00:00" title="August  4, 2008 12:12PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, ask a question like that and you're bound to get someone <a href="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/death.html" rel="nofollow">pointing you to a similar or identical concept</a>.  But don't let that discourage you if it is a game that you feel strongly needs to be written.  Particularly if it'll do some good.  I'd love to see a game written explicitly for play by the people who will need to say goodbye to your friend in the near future.  Write it for him, and for them, and see what happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser" title="kevin.weiser"><img alt="kevin.weiser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.finitesite.com/spiderlegs/wlkngI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser">kevin.weiser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160619/#Comment_160619" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-04T12:27:33+00:00" title="August  4, 2008 12:27PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for pointing that out to me. Judging by what i've read there, it definetly looks like there's room for my idea too. They went a pretty different direction from where I was thinking, so that's a releif. My debate now is: do I read what they've done? I know this is a collaborative community and people freely borrow ideas and mechanics from each other, but I'm still nervous that if I read it it'll wash away all my own ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160622/#Comment_160622" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-04T12:36:04+00:00" title="August  4, 2008 12:36PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2008 12:36PM by Josh Roby.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kevin.weiser</cite>It doesn't seem like you can have an indie gaming podcast without designing your own game as well</blockquote>\nJust as a data point, I would love to hear an indie-games podcast that wasn't done by somebody designing their own game.<br/><br/>...of course, Paul Tevis, Ryan Macklin, and the Kryos guys started off not designing, too, so maybe it is just catching.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160625/#Comment_160625" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-04T12:38:59+00:00" title="August  4, 2008 12:38PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You will find pretty strong opinions on both sides of that equation...the "don't read it it will muddy your vision" side (and I've seen that happen more than once) and the "read everything you can, borrow aggressively the parts you like and ignore the rest side" (and I've done that more than once).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy best advice is DO NOT read any other related GAME inspirational material until you got a pretty solid idea of your personal vision for this game and what you're trying to accomplish with it.  Quite possibly until you have an initial playable draft although that's not strictly necessary if your vision is really clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly then look to see what other games may have covered similar ground (either specifically related to your theme, or just broader issues of hitting heavy emotional content through play)...but when you do resist the temptation to skew your vision to accomodate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser" title="kevin.weiser"><img alt="kevin.weiser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.finitesite.com/spiderlegs/wlkngI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser">kevin.weiser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160626/#Comment_160626" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-04T12:39:36+00:00" title="August  4, 2008 12:39PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The focus of my podcast is going to be my transition from Traditional gamer to Story gamer.

I can tell your game is going to be brilliant!<br/><br/>In all seriousness, I am firmly in the "read all you can camp" because experience has shown it's worked for me.  What I try to do is find games that both do what I want to do and are in the same genre that I am in.  For Messiah, the first thing I did was drudge up memories of playing the Illuminati card game and James Brown's Blood and Bronze because they had roleplaying and strategy elements to them.<br/><br/>With Mecha (my first design) I pretty much stopped reading gaming books.  Once I had a draft and a few playtests under my belt, my players started pointing out similiarities in some of my mechanics.  In some cases, I was taking a mechanic and twisting it and making it work for me game.  In other cases, the ideas were already out there and the other games were doing them better.  So I was able to see how things worked in other games and improve my game by either taking the example of those other games or by dropping the mechanic entirely because I could not do it as well as those other games.<br/><br/>I also read a lot of games that did mecha anime, but completely differently.  VOTOMS the roleplaying game, Project A-Ko, Mechwarrior, Mekton, etc. are all mecha games, but they are on the way far end of crunchy while I was trying to develop a much more streamlined, rules light system.<br/><br/><br/>Ultimately, I think it's a great exercise to know what is out there.  For instance, both Mecha and Agon use circular battle maps.  It was important for me to know why the way I did it was different and well-suited to the genre I was trying to emulate or else I might as well just write an Agon hack.<br/><br/>I hope that makes sense/helps.<br/><br/>And like Clyde, if you need podcasting advice, the CP guys have plenty of stories about what not to do.

Read Death's Door, and read A Flower for Mara, sure.  And read stuff that's <i>entirely unrelated</i>.  Read novels.  Read poetry.  Read comics.  Read treatises.  Go to a museum and look at paintings, archaic airplanes, model dinosaurs.  Attend plays and movies and operas.  Take a trip to Mexico.  It will all help.<br/><br/>Many times, when I make this suggestion to people, they don't get it, so I've got an example I use a lot:  JRR Tolkien.  Consider a young, enthusiastic person who has read Lord of the Rings and now decides to write their own high-fantasy epic.  Their heart's in the right place, but I'll bet you a beer that what they write will suck on ice.  On the other hand, Tolkien's great.  So, what's the difference here?  <i>Information</i>.  The example young person is only <i>informed</i> by LotR.  Tolkien was <i>informed</i> by European history, folklore, legend, philology, Medieval literature (from a variety of nations), his own experiences in WWI, and devil knows what else.  And <i>that</i> is why Tolkien rocks and certain fantasy authors (who I won't name) suck.<br/><br/>-Marshall                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163321/#Comment_163321" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T12:57:00+00:00" title="August 19, 2008 12:57PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya,<br/><br/>Write the game you need to write.
