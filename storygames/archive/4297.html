Brace yourselves! I had to chop them up<br/>\nbecause the forum software complained...</p>\n<h2>Actual Game Design Report</h2>\n<p><em>When I refer to "the list", I mean the "The Jeepform Piece of the Cake" list <a href="http://jeepen.org/dict/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>How to Jeep? This is going to be a very personal account. This is<br/>\nby no means a formalised process.</p>\n<p>There are two reasons why I would write a game. "I need to" and "a<br/>\ncon is coming up." The second one works best, I need deadlines to<br/>\nget things done, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Actually, I<br/>\nmake a lot of games <em>at</em> cons, too. There is something about being<br/>\nin that environment that get my creative juices flowing.</p>\n<p>I generally start with one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A feeling</li>\n<li>A picture</li>\n<li>A subject or message</li>\n<li>A hard problem (i.e., I don't know how to make a game of X)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What mostly intrigues me as a jeepwright are things that seem hard<br/>\nto pull off, or subjects that I can tackle neatly. An example of<br/>\nthe first one is No sign of Alex, which is about misremembering<br/>\nand disremembering. Quite a lot of thinking had to go into that<br/>\none before I came up with a good way of doing it. An example of<br/>\nthe latter is Doubt, where we had a pretty good grasp on the<br/>\nsubject from the start, and knew what we wanted to play with.</p>\n<p>In the case of Doubt, we (we being me and Fredrik Axelzon, my<br/>\nco-pilot) wanted to tackle subjects that were relevant to<br/>\nourselves and to people that we knew. Fredrik had just broken up<br/>\nfrom a 3-year relationship, and on my personal agenda was using<br/>\nthe game to comment on a few relationships in my close vicinity<br/>\n-- relations-ships of presumptive players. We wanted a game that<br/>\ncould be played "close to home", with only a thin wrapper around<br/>\nthe players.</p>\n<p>We were at the time very keen on making a game where the players<br/>\ncreated most of the content, and this felt like a very good idea<br/>\nif we wanted players to deal with baggage of their own. We settled<br/>\nfor doing this early on, but didn't yet know how to do it.</p>\n<p>Scandinavian con scenarios are generally 3-6 hours long, and<br/>\nunless you want to be special, that becomes a key factor in the<br/>\ndesign. Since we wanted the scenario to stretch over possibly<br/>\nweeks or months of time in the diegesis, we decided to play it in<br/>\nthe form of individual scenes. (Even though I often do that, I<br/>\ndon't like it, and it always feels like a failure.) We decided<br/>\nscenes were good because they were modular units that could be<br/>\ntalked about in isolation (how much do I come off as a computer<br/>\nscientist now, I wonder) and planned individually. That meant we<br/>\ncould let different players suggest different scenes, which is<br/>\ngood if you need to cram a lot into a 3-6 hour time slot. Later,<br/>\nwe realised that we didn't want them to be planned individually,<br/>\nbut together.</p>\n<p>We didn't want long breaks between the scenes, because that has<br/>\nthe potential of slowing the game down. Also, in my experience, it<br/>\nis not until you start playing that it can start to suck. The more<br/>\nbreaks, the more opportunities for players to "waste time being<br/>\nsafe." [Cf. point 3 on the second list of the Jeep dictionary --<br/>\ngood flow.]</p>\n<p>To this end, we opted for a pre-planning phase. "Hey, let's give<br/>\nthe players 30 minutes to come up with scenes." We know it isn't<br/>\ngoing to be those scenes in the end, but we want the players to<br/>\nthink about possibilities etc. -- brainstorm basically --<br/>\nbeforehand to keep break-time down while playing. It seems to work<br/>\n-- the longer the pre-phase (within limits of course), the shorter<br/>\nthe breaks.</p>\n<p>In the spirit of close to home, we decided not to have any<br/>\ncharacter descriptions for the main characters. There is <em>none</em>,<br/>\nexcept what is stated in the setting: "You are actors, you are<br/>\ntogether, you are also playing lovers on stage right now." The<br/>\nidea was to have little character to hide behind. All other<br/>\ncharacters are described except the two main characters. [Cf. 9)<br/>\non the list.]</p>\n<p>We discussed number of players. Two was too little -- we wanted<br/>\nthe players to be tempted by other players. GM's generally have<br/>\nhigh status, so the GM playing a temptation was out of the<br/>\nquestion. Four players, two men and two women, seemed perfect. We<br/>\ndidn't want to have more than two main characters -- the focus<br/>\nshould be on one relationship and one relationship only.  We let<br/>\nthe other two players play all the extras. [Cf. 11) on the list.]</p>\n<p>If you have 3-6 hours to introduce and test a relationship, and<br/>\npossibly get some closure on it, you need to move fast. As fans of<br/>\nmeta-playing, we also wanted to give the players the opportunity<br/>\nto talk about these things. During the play-test, the players at<br/>\none point got into a discussion about how to avoid saying an<br/>\nex-lovers name during sex. When I heard my girl friend saying<br/>\n"this is why we call them all 'honey'", which is what she calls<br/>\nme, I realised that I shouldn't cut these discussions, but that<br/>\nthey were an integral part of the game. [Cf. 8) on the list]</p>\n<p>When you act you character, things tend to take time. If I want to<br/>\nseduce another character in a somewhat realistic manner, it is<br/>\ngoing to take time, which we don't have. Jumping between scenes is<br/>\na good way of cutting to the chase. Doing "one hour later" cuts,<br/>\nhowever, felt like it could damage the players' feelings so we<br/>\nopted that one out.</p>\n<p>One very early idea, before anything else had been decided, we had<br/>\ntalked about parallel stories. When we came up with the theatre<br/>\nsetting, that just clicked. Let's play both their every day lives<br/>\nand the play and alternate between them. Since the play is a play,<br/>\nit is only fair that we get to decide it, which will give us a<br/>\ngood means of giving input, and the play can echo the everyday<br/>\nlife and allow for some cool inter-textual references.</p>\n<p>(Also, we didn't want the two players playing all extras to feel<br/>\npowerless or inferior. Yes, this is ridiculous, but at a con, you<br/>\nnever know what players you'll get. Thus, the players playing<br/>\nextras in the everyday life scenes would play the main characters'<br/>\ncharacters on stage -- tables turned. [Cf. 10, sort of])</p>\n<p>I had recently heard a story from a friend of mine who was playing<br/>\nkids' theatre in a costume with two people in, him and his girl<br/>\nfriend. The day before the premier they had broken up and found<br/>\nthemselves stuck in this two-person costume for a month. Wonderful<br/>\nstory. The possibility of this outcome became a driver in itself.</p>\n<p>(1 / 3 -- continues in next post)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad" title="Tobias Wrigstad"><img alt="Tobias Wrigstad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad">Tobias Wrigstad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97031/#Comment_97031" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T20:40:47+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  8:40PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2007 8:58PM by Tobias Wrigstad.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>(cont'd)</p>\n<p>The theatre setting allowed us to say: it's a play, it's okay to<br/>\nact out. On stage, people expect monologues, fast pace, etc. So it<br/>\nwas a very natural addition to the game. Also, as the play<br/>\nprogressed to an end, we thought it would give the feeling of the<br/>\ngame progressing, even if the characters' story wasn't, which was<br/>\ngood. Scenes on stage are supposed to start with monologues, which<br/>\nhave so far worked really great. Since the play is so abstract and<br/>\nweird (it isn't meant to be good theatre, but to create good<br/>\nrole-play), monologues are generally played close to home. I<br/>\nthink. Here is an example subject, to see what I mean:</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Could it be the case that almost all people can form a working<br/>\n  couple? That the hard part is getting over that threshold making<br/>\n  love work? A relationship is like a romantic agreement. Marriage<br/>\n  is a false way of trying to own another person. A false sense of<br/>\n  security.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>[Cf. points 7 and 12]</p>\n<p>We decided to add a few rules to make the game the kind of game we<br/>\nwanted.</p>\n<p>We didn't want this to become a "swinger game", so we decided on<br/>\nthe rule that only one of the main characters was allowed to<br/>\nsuccumb to a temptation. We carefully chose "allowed" rather than<br/>\n"must" to keep the possibility of none of them falling open. Also,<br/>\nthis may not be discussed out of character. This creates an<br/>\ninteresting situation in the meta-play where the players look at<br/>\neach others' scenes wondering if he/she is going to fall.</p>\n<p>We added a rule to say "two-scene build-up" for two reasons. We<br/>\nwanted the temptations to be sincere (the rule incidentally<br/>\ndefines a one-night-stand not as a temptation) and to further<br/>\nfacilitate the meta-play situation above. Now, the other players<br/>\nhave more time to react on a temptation because it takes at least<br/>\ntwo scenes, and also it allows me to almost kiss you in the first<br/>\nscene we have, without it counting as falling. This creates<br/>\ninteresting dynamics in the game.</p>\n<p>The heterosexual rule was created to make the possible number of<br/>\ntemptations manageable, and to prevent the game becoming about<br/>\ncoming out or realising that you're gay. Those things are<br/>\ninteresting too, but this time we wanted focus elsewhere. (It has<br/>\nbeen very fashionable to play with gender and poly amory in the<br/>\nNordic larp scene for a few years, and I'm quite tired of it. I've<br/>\nhad players tell me Doubt was "refreshingly hetero-normative"...)</p>\n<p>We chose to confine players to places and people from a list to<br/>\nkeep things more manageable. We also believe that restrictions<br/>\nfoster creativity, so giving the players tools to work with is a<br/>\ngood idea. Also, within the 30-45 minute pre-planning phase, there<br/>\nare only so many things you can focus on. We chose quite classic<br/>\ncharacters, like the ex-girl friend, the real-estate agent, the<br/>\nyoung step-mother, the teacher, etc. And the places really aren't<br/>\nthat important really.</p>\n<p>The rule <em>What happens in Paris stays in Paris</em> just was too fun<br/>\nnot to have. One of the players quoted it during the play-test,<br/>\nand I had to add it in. In a stroke of genius, I wrote it as<br/>\n"define it however you like", basically. Players know that they<br/>\ncan play that joker if they go to Paris, and it's worked great so<br/>\nfar with many different interpretations.</p>\n<p>We decided that 8 scenes for four players was a good number. In<br/>\nhindsight, 7 would have been better since it is not dividable by<br/>\n4. We also decided that each player would have 2 more scenes to<br/>\nthrow in whenever to follow up on things that happened in the<br/>\ngame. Thus, players would not be stressed about not getting<br/>\nclosure, and this would smoothen the pre-planning phase. In the<br/>\nplay-test, the players surprised us by using these scenes, not for<br/>\nthemselves, but for throwing temptations at others.</p>\n<p>Finally, we settled for linear time. This game is like Mystic<br/>\nRiver -- a straight story. Going back to the early days of the<br/>\nmain characters' relationship isn't interesting. The temptations<br/>\nand how thay affect the main characters are.</p>\n<p>The process of coming up with rules like this is very ad hoc. We<br/>\nhad been discussing how to make sure the game would be about what<br/>\nwe wanted it to be about. We could have used other means, but<br/>\nchoose very explicit ones that would work well with the<br/>\npre-planning phase. In a game without such a phase, I might have<br/>\nchosen other methods. (Alex is a good example for another post.)</p>\n<p>(2 / 3 -- continues in next post)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad" title="Tobias Wrigstad"><img alt="Tobias Wrigstad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad">Tobias Wrigstad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97032/#Comment_97032" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T20:41:30+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  8:41PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2007 9:02PM by Tobias Wrigstad.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>(cont'd -- last post)</p>\n<p>So, what did we have? We had a description of what we wanted the<br/>\ngame to be about. We had the two stories -- everyday life and on<br/>\nstage, and inter-textual references between them. We had a<br/>\npre-planning phase that created scenes to be played alongside the<br/>\nstage ones. We had rules that would "make sure" the game didn't<br/>\nstray too far from where we wanted it to go. We now only had to<br/>\ntie it all together.</p>\n<p>Inspired by a presentation at Knutpunkt in 2006, I wanted to have<br/>\na "game board" with all relevant info on. We decided to list all<br/>\nthe scenes from the play on the board, and force the players to<br/>\ninsert the scenes they made in the pre-planing into this schedule.<br/>\nPlayers look at the schedule and say things like "Ooh! Cool,<br/>\nnaturally the viewing of the great flat must happen next to<br/>\nNicole's show, since these scenes really are about the same<br/>\nthing!" and things like that (I didn't think about that when I<br/>\nwrote them). They become inspired by the task of creating these<br/>\nreferences between the stories, and they make very different<br/>\ninterpretations.</p>\n<p>Coming up with the idea took about 1 month, mostly because Fredrik<br/>\nand I live busy lives in different parts of Sweden. We spend<br/>\nperhaps one week full-time thinking about the things above, spread<br/>\nover several months. We play-tested it once, and it worked pretty<br/>\nmuch like we had anticipated. The big exception was that the four<br/>\nplayers couldn't stop talking about it for a few weeks after. It<br/>\nhad really hit them hard, in a good way. I wasn't as positive to<br/>\nthe game before the play-test as I was afterwards.</p>\n<p>I was faced with the task of typing it all up during Christmas. I<br/>\nwasn't used to describing a game that don't really exist<br/>\nbeforehand, but I wanted to write something that would inspire<br/>\nGM's and also make them secure about playing the game. Luckily, I<br/>\nhad an audio recording of the play-test so I used that to recreate<br/>\nthe game. The examples of things to throw in have, to the best of<br/>\nmy knowledge, never been used, and they were put there more as a<br/>\nsubliminal message to the GM -- if you want something to happen,<br/>\nmaybe someone will spill sauce...</p>\n<p>At a few times, I would go back to the Jeep dictionary and go over<br/>\nthe points just to get some questions to ask myself about how we<br/>\nwere making the game. For example, we concluded that it was good<br/>\nto have only one GM to lower the threshold of playing close to<br/>\nhome [Cf. point 13 and 20]</p>\n<p>Doubt is a patch-work story. Sometimes, we get proper closure (a<br/>\nreal end-scene or something) and sometimes, we just get a feel for<br/>\nwhat will happen down the road [Cf. point 17]. It is completely<br/>\ntransparent, and the material is open for everyone to read,<br/>\nplayers and GM's alike.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure I managed to answer your question, but maybe your<br/>\nanswer can be mined from this lenghty recollection. There is, as I<br/>\nsaid, no formalised process for doing this. Instead I tried to<br/>\ngive rational for design decisions.</p>\n<p>We don't have a big model that we rely on, or an actively used<br/>\nterminology for certain mechanisms of the game. The driver is<br/>\ntelling the story or conveying the message, satisfying any<br/>\nconstraints that might exist, like time slots at a con, random<br/>\nplayers that haven't prepared themselves, etc.</p>\n<p>I will continue this description in another post later, talking<br/>\nabout No sign of Alex and The Upgrade! I think those have good<br/>\nexamples in them.</p>\n<p>Oh, I forgot one important part. We force the GM to hold very<br/>\npersonal monologues about the subject of the game. We do this for<br/>\nthree reasons. 1) keeping the players honest -- if we eat our own<br/>\ndog food, then it must be OK, right? 2) the GM get to set the tone<br/>\nof the game with his monologues 3) the GM shouldn't be let off the<br/>\nhook!</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97036/#Comment_97036" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T21:22:52+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  9:22PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>We don't have a big model that we rely on, or an actively used terminology for certain mechanisms of the game.

And since the game is a lot about dead parents, it<br/>\nwas a bit too much to ask him to keep working on the game. In<br/>\nhindsight, this was probably good, as I felt compelled to get the<br/>\n"impossible" set of constraints we had created going.</p>\n<p>Jan and I had a shopping list of things we wanted to have in the<br/>\ngame. We wanted role-playing against a tape recorder, distance<br/>\nbetween people in the same physical space, insanity, fascination<br/>\nfor space, siblings, the Swedish archipelago, nothing happens,<br/>\ntime-lines that move in different directions, brainwash, mild<br/>\nmind-fuck, adult people are never quite in the picture (just like<br/>\nin Tom and Jerry), lunar landings, why can't anyone remember the<br/>\nname of the third guy on Apollo 11, etc.</p>\n<p>The subject of the game was disremembering and misremembering,<br/>\nmisunderstanding, misinterpretation, different perspectives and<br/>\ntruths, as in who gets to define reality. Quite a mouthful, no?</p>\n<p>Well, the bit that got me stumped was this: "Everything that is<br/>\ngoing to happen already happen. Or it didn't happen at all. Plus<br/>\nthe thing about time-lines and distance between people in the same<br/>\nphysical space."</p>\n<p>Basically, the game was about memories and everything that<br/>\nhappened in the should take place in these memories. But we also<br/>\nwanted to play several versions of these memories, since it should<br/>\nnot be clear whose version of reality was true, and who had the<br/>\nright to define the past. So, how to deal with that in a jeepform<br/>\nsetting, with a minimum of meta-discussion and break from<br/>\ncharacter? I had to think hard about that one I can tell you.</p>\n<p>So, what I wanted was agility: breaking character as little as<br/>\npossible, keeping players not in the memory involved, playing out<br/>\ndifferent versions of the memory, little or no GM input.</p>\n<p>What I came up with is called "standing and sitting play" in jeep<br/>\nterms. It is about different player stances being used<br/>\nsimultaneously in the game. The rule is simple, and it works like<br/>\nthis (more at <a href="http://jeepen.org/dict/#sitting_and_standing_play" rel="nofollow">jeepen.org/dict</a>):</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>The basics of sitting and standing play are easy: a player<br/>\n  acting out something in the game's reality should be sitting; a<br/>\n  player acting out a dream, memory or fantasy should be<br/>\n  standing. The reasons for this are twofold: first, there must be<br/>\n  a clear way of distinguishing between the two, since scenes at<br/>\n  both "levels" will be played simultaneously. Second, players are<br/>\n  usually keen on playing their characters moving about etc. which<br/>\n  encourages play set in the second level which I think is good.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>The last may not be as true for an international crowd, though.</p>\n<p>No Sign of Alex has 8 characters. Or rather, it has four<br/>\ncharacters, two brother-sister pairs who happen to be cousins. But<br/>\nevery character is played by two players. One playing the<br/>\ncharacter in 1969 and one in 1982. In the 1969 story line, they<br/>\nare around 20 years old, and are sitting in a sofa in "The kids'<br/>\nhouse" eagerly awaiting a TV broadcast from the lunar landing. In<br/>\n1982, the same four characters are sitting in the same sofa in the<br/>\nsame house after just having attended Dad's funeral. The 1969 team<br/>\nis in high spirit, having waited for this night for so long. The<br/>\n1982 team is quiet and low, and haven't really seen each other for<br/>\nquite some time. The playing area is made like a mirror, so<br/>\nStellan 69 is sitting opposite of Stellan 82, etc. Two rooms<br/>\nmirroring each other.</p>\n<p>These are the "sitting scenes" which are the foundation for the<br/>\ngame. Team 69 dreams about the future -- this night marks<br/>\nsomething big (Lunar landing). There are no obstacles anymore, and<br/>\nthey will own the world. Team 82 is thinking about the past. Team<br/>\n69 is telling team 82 what they were like back then and what they<br/>\nwanted to become, and team 82 is telling team 69 about how it all<br/>\nturned out.</p>\n<p>Whenever someone in team 69 stands up, he/she is acting out a<br/>\nstory, a lie, a possible future. The character who was first to<br/>\nstand up is the "owner of the current interpretation", and all<br/>\nother characters that are dragged into the story have to play<br/>\naccording to the first character's recollection.</p>\n<p>The same happens in team 82, but there they exploring their common<br/>\npast instead of thinking about the future.</p>\n<p>The contents of what happens in the standing play is visible to<br/>\nthe sitting characters -- we think about it as stories being told<br/>\nbetween the sitting characters. This means that the sitting play<br/>\ncan build on what goes on in the standing scenes.</p>\n<p>But there is more. Sitting characters can comment on what happens<br/>\nin the standing scenes. If Stellan says, "Actually, that's not<br/>\nwhat happened", the standing players might halt and sit down,<br/>\nallowing Stellan to stand up first, to be the controller of a<br/>\ndifferent interpretation of the same scene. Or a standing<br/>\ncharacter may just briefly sit down, exchanging a few words with<br/>\nStellan, and go back up again -- incorporating or ignoring what<br/>\nStellan said. <em>I really like this technique.</em></p>\n<p>So, team 82 is sort of playing backwards. Their scenes will go<br/>\nfurther and further back in time. And team 69's will go<br/>\nincreasingly forward in time. Until they meet.</p>\n<p>The only direct interaction between the teams (except that they<br/>\nget to watch each others' stories) is one character, Rina, who has<br/>\na mental disorder. In 1969, she is still quite young, and everyone<br/>\nthinks she's just got a lively imagination. In 1982, one of the<br/>\nother characters is her care taker. The two Rina's are free to<br/>\nstep into the playing spaces of the other team and interact with<br/>\neach other. Carry information across between the teams. In 1982,<br/>\nRina is not accepting the fact that Dad is dead, so she chooses<br/>\nRina 69's version of life, and lives there.</p>\n<p>What the standing and sitting play gave us was the ability to have<br/>\nseveral scenes acted out at several levels of the game. I've been<br/>\nin games where 5 different scenes happened at once, but generally,<br/>\nthe number of scenes is 2-3. It also gave us tools to play with<br/>\ndifferent versions of the same memory, both across teams and<br/>\nwithin a team. In this mirroring setting, it gave us that distance<br/>\nthat we wanted, in that the teams cannot directly interact. Etc.</p>\n<p>A good example of how one quite simple technique (again, when you<br/>\nuse it in a game, it is pretty straightforward) can solve many<br/>\nproblems (desires) in a game design.</p>\n<p>(continues in next post)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad" title="Tobias Wrigstad"><img alt="Tobias Wrigstad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad">Tobias Wrigstad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97084/#Comment_97084" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T06:06:23+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  6:06AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>(cont'd)</p>\n<p>Another thing that went into the game design was <em>long<br/>\ncharacters</em>. And I mean long. The characters are about 30 pages<br/>\neach of prose. They are divided into roughly 40 recollections about<br/>\nsomething, and it isn't always clear from whose perspective they<br/>\nare. The players get these (preferably long beforehand), read them<br/>\nand are then given the task to write down some recollections of<br/>\nevents given by vague headlines on a piece of paper. Then, the<br/>\nGM's take their long characters and they are left with whatever<br/>\nthey jotted down.</p>\n<p>This is of course a blunt reference to the misremember /<br/>\ndisremember, theme of the game. What I find the coolest is that a<br/>\nlot of times, people roll back complete lines from their character<br/>\nprose, completely without knowing it.</p>\n<p>To play up the truth thing, the GM's are playing roles. One GM<br/>\nplay the good GM, and one play the evil GM. The good GM likes the<br/>\nplayers and reassures them and boosts them, whereas the other GM<br/>\ndislikes the players and tries to give off the feeling that the<br/>\nplayers are doing a bad job. The GM's are also in dispute about<br/>\nwhat memories should be played or not, to the point of the evil GM<br/>\nleaving when the good GM starts a scene requiring all the players<br/>\nto sing.

Is there a particular philosophy concerning which is more effective given a or b variable, or is it simply a matter of an individual writer's taste?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>In the case of Doubt, we designed the play (the pre-decided scenes) to be a story about a relationsship going down the drain because we figured that would be a good parallel story to whatever the players came up with. Making that happy would have made it impossible for the players to make a happy story too. Or so we thought.</p>\n<p>In Doubt, the scenes in the everyday life are determined by the players beforehand. They brainstorm. That can sound like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>"This happening here is a nice mirror of this thins happening over here"</li>\n<li>"If they are breaking up, I think a trip to Paris to save the relationship is a good idea, perhaps X scenes in"</li>\n<li>"A family dinner in the end is a good idea"</li>\n<li>"I want a scene where Julia has been jogging and fallen, and the jogging man helps her up"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Etc. They set things up for the temptations to be possible.</p>\n<p>The scenes created on the fly are the ones where the players think "Hey, wasn't there a spark there between the jogger and Julia, I want a scene with Julia and the jogger at a cafe close to the running track". And things like that. When the real-estate agent is hitting on Julia, another player says "At the same time, Tom is lunching with Jennie (his ex-girl friend) " to see if maybe there is a temptation there that can be fallen for before Julia falls (if she falls) for the real-estate guy. Or she falls, and her player says, "I want a scene with Julia and the real-estate guy in Tom and Julia's apartment".</p>\n<p>So the on-the-fly scenes are about following up and following through. And the pre-decided ones (by the players and writers) are about giving a back-bone to the story.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad" title="Tobias Wrigstad"><img alt="Tobias Wrigstad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad">Tobias Wrigstad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97382/#Comment_97382" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T19:46:27+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  7:46PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hi Ben,</p>\n<p>I think what you want is the actual <a href="http://jeepen.org/games/doubt" rel="nofollow">Doubt</a> scenario.

We encourage the players to name scenes so that it becomes easier to remember what you wanted to do with them when it is time to play them, plus it forces the players to make a "capsule definition" of the scene, which avoids fuzzyness like "Let's have a scene with X and Y at place Z\xe2\u20ac\xa6" It becomes easy to refer to those scene names afterward.

They are encouraged to listen to each other and be an active audience, but about half the time, both teams will be playing simultaneously. Standing scenes are your average freeform scenes -- i.e., characters are larping (if you will). There is no narration going on at all. If Stellan wants to present a different view of a scene, he might stop it, stand up and say, "You got it wrong! I was standing over here\xe2\u20ac\xa6" and then they start freeform it again.</p>\n<p>The player who initiated the scene basically has GM power, but is in character -- and the other players will have to carefully listen and understand where this player wants the scene to go. Sometimes, the player will do a "no, like this" to change something, but that's generally all. No long narrations at all in this game.</p>\n<p>For example: four people are sitting down, talking about the up-coming lunar landing, sometimes pausing to listen to the other team across the room. In this team, one person initiates a scene about Dad's bad temper and how Stellan got a beating for destroying the expensive telescope. The scene starts with just Stellan and Rina standing, Petter and Lina still sitting, watching or chatting, before they are also dragged in to poke fun at Stellan, enviout about the expensive telescope Dad has bought for him. They start fighting playfully, until the telescope accidentally get hit and Stellan is destroyed. Rina, the crazy one, runs over to the other team and starts interacting with Rina there, and gets her excited and standing up and the first team starts playing the same scene, but now it might actually be happening (possibly in a different way), 12 years earlier. Or something like that.</p>\n<p>How will the players know what to do in the telescope scene? Easy. They have all read a version of it in their long characters. Or the initiating player carefully guides them through the scene by taking the lead.

I *think* I know what Ben is looking for. We'll see.<br/><br/>I wish I had played White Out, for Sam's sake. But I'll at least describe part of the Upgrade for variety.  (Looking back at Moreno's account of Doubt it is detailed and clear--from the perspective of having played the darn thing)<br/><br/><b>setting</b><br/>The Upgrade is a game where the players play contestants on a reality tv show, reminiscent of one called "Tempation Island".  In the story, the characters enter the show in couples, get switched around, spend time with the new partner,  then have to choose whether to go back to their original or to "upgrade" to the new at the end.  <br/><br/><b>characters</b><br/>The players choose characters from a pre-written set.  There are three couples, each of which has issues and problems under the surface. The character I played was cheating: she had entered with her step-brother (not blood related!) posing as her boyfriend. When we started the game, we read a card that gave  us a short run-down on the character we'd play, which included some information about our character's partner, but no one else.  <br/><br/><b>opening scene</b><br/>The game begins with a "speed dating" session. The players sit in a row, those playing women characters facing those playing men (in my game I was the only woman) . We got a chance to interact with our character's original partner initially, to allow us as players to create a dynamic between the two. Then the male characters shuffled down a seat and we interacted with the next person, and so on.  After this, the men chose a new woman to go with, and the new couples were set.<br/><br/>The choice was purely up to the player. The interactions during the speed dating were purely based on what we'd read in our character sheets. The representation used in the story was the man giving the woman a rose, symbolized by a marker irl. <br/><br/><b>cues</b><br/>Something different about this from the (one) other larp I've been involved in and others I've looked at, is kind of striking now that I think about it. The write up was a short narrative description of what the character was like and her relationship with her brother.  There were no cues in the character write up that said things like "she hates X" or "her goal is Y". There was not an elaborate net of interconnections with other characters. All of that of course would not be needed. The situation itself connects the characters, rather than the connections creating the situation if that makes sense.  <br/><br/><b>play</b><br/>When play begins, one person is the host of the show, initially the gm. Later other players can take this role if desired, apparently. They speak as if to an audience (or to a real audience if one is available) and ask the players now seated in a row as the "new" couples.  The show begins at the end of the series, when everything has taken place. However, you play out scenes which are "clips" or flashbacks to what has gone before: you are, of course, making it up as you go along. We don't know what happened until it gets played out. There is no known end state to this game, unlike Doubt. <br/><br/>Playing out a scene: the host asks someone to introduce a clip.  That player describes a scene. That person and the person playing their new partner then takes central stage and "plays out" what happens.  <br/><br/>What does that mean? You get up and act out what your character does in the situation described.  Other players may walk in as extras. Tobias, who was gming, was a waiter at a restaurant in one. <br/><br/>However, instead of just going on and on, the other players can jump in and play your characters either in flash forward or flashback.  Flashbacks are played out in an area demarcated to the side of the central scene. Flashforwards in the area on the other side. The point of this is to shed new light on the events unfolding (which may be uncomplicated), or to make things difficult for the players and the characters in the scene.  Anyone can initiate it at any time. As an "interrupt", so to speak.<br/><br/>From the audience perspective, I believe all of the played scenes are taken as having been revealed via tape in the show.  <br/><br/><br/>But, is what you're looking for Ben? I'm not sure if it's any better.  Experience is certainly the best teacher. The part that interests me is how pressure is put on the players/characters in these games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97481/#Comment_97481" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T07:54:09+00:00" title="September 19, 2007  7:54AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From pm between Tobias and I.

As much as possible, all player input is in character, and almost all of the situations I've seen seem to be driving towards emotional situations.\n<blockquote>Are you expected to actually feel your characters' emotions?</blockquote>\nYes, but it seems to be a goal of the jeepwrights, as opposed to an explicit player goal.  There's frequent proud references to how effecting jeepform play is, and that the situations are crafted out of the GMs personal lives and thoughts.\n<blockquote>Are there any conventions for player-to-player communication?

I've only been involved in one play of Upgrade (and mostly in audience, just ten minutes of playing) and as far as I could see, there was contact if the situtation called it. I don't think I've witnessed the No Touch -rule in Nordic (well, Finnish, but I'm projecting here) LARPs in long time, if ever. There are certain lines you don't want to cross unless you're in very familiar company (kissing could be though as such) and things like sexual intercourse tend to be simulated with something else. <br/><br/>You're supposed to emote the emotions; I'd go as far as saying that you're supposed to bring them out in a way that communicates them more clearly than your characters speech and body language imply (thus, monologues and some telegraphing techniques). I'm not sure about feeling characters emotions, as a player - I'd think it's something that's very much encouraged, but that's the thing that keeps hitting on my fingers when I'm thinkin jeepform playing from the angle of my own playing style and experiences. Can't get my head around on how to mix the meta-communication and still getting that emotional stuff from the character. Though some techniques like the mentioned monologues could be very powerful tools for this.<br/><br/>Feel free to correct, Tobias.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97558/#Comment_97558" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T12:29:40+00:00" title="September 19, 2007 12:29PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>Given that I've read plenty of jeep responses to "isn't that a problem?"

Convincing them that such a rule not only exists, but is common and also not used to create dramatic effect is far from easy. There certainly are some differences between our player/playing cultures.</p>\n<p>In art-house larps, some people will have sex in-character "if the story demands it". I could not do that, I think. I'm pretty sure I couldn't have sex and stay in character.</p>\n<p>As an art-house larper, you gain cred by pulling off crazy shit, like sex in character, actual physical violence etc. Far from everyone is like that, but these people exist and are generally viewed as cool.</p>\n<p>Again, remember, Jeepform <strong>isn't</strong> larp! (At least not when I'm talking about it here in this context.) It is another kind of acting out. People quite seldom kiss in jeepform games, unless they are an off-game couple. I sure as hell never witnessed (or heard of) actual sex in a jeepform or freeform game.</p>\n<p>Other than the different forms (larp and jeepform) having different value sets, I also think it has a lot to do with how the game is played. After 10 hours of consecutive, uninterrupted character immersion (larp, not jeepform), there is, unless the players don't connect, going to be enough player intimacy to, say, kiss. I kissed my female co-player in A Nice Evening with the Family, and I had never met her before the game. We could probably have gotten away without it, but after several hours of build-up to that kiss -- our story arc was that of falling in love again after 10 years -- not kissing would have felt silly. And it was an extremely beautiful scene, and playing it out physically goes straight to your heart. It surely did go straight to mine.</p>\n<p>When you're only playing for a few hours, are jumping back and forth in time, and might all of a sudden be asked to play the barman (this is more like jeepform), that intimacy is lost. Larp is character immersion which means that if we kiss, I'll feel it. While being quite character immersive (depending on the game), Jeepform's focus is on story immersion, which means that if we say we kiss at the right moment, we'll feel it. Actually doing it is less important. But if I have played 2 cm from your mouth for 5 minutes, I think you'll feel the not acted-out kiss more than if I was sitting across a table all the time.</p>\n<p>I think I mentioned this already, but my girl friend is writing a game where she will use the no touching rule in hope of creating feelings of isoalation in the players. That's how different it can be.</p>\n<p>Now I'll read the rest and whip up some answers.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad" title="Tobias Wrigstad"><img alt="Tobias Wrigstad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad">Tobias Wrigstad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97661/#Comment_97661" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T18:52:22+00:00" title="September 19, 2007  6:52PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Under my Skin is the poly amory game, right?</p>\n<p>I'd like to play Under the Skin with my girl friend and one of my closest friends, Martin say.

You don't talk out of character unless it is absolutely<br/>\nnecessary and cannot be solved by in-game communication and<br/>\ntelegraphing. If your character is drunk, you act as if you were<br/>\ndrunk. If your character slams his fist into the wall in despair,<br/>\nyou do that as hard of soft as you like -- so that everyone sees<br/>\nthat you do it.</p>\n<p>You are definitely expected to emote your characters' emotions.<br/>\nBut more realistically that theatrically, if you know what I mean.<br/>\nSome degree of immersion -- identifying with your character and<br/>\nfeeling the character's emotions is desirable, but not too<br/>\nmuch. If you are too much in character, you lose sight of the<br/>\nstory. It is not about your character, but about the story. Even<br/>\nif the story is about your character.</p>\n<p>Violence is generally acted out by more theatrical means. Maybe<br/>\nI'll corner you and mark that I'm hitting you (my fists may not<br/>\neven touch you). Your character will react, maybe you'll fight me<br/>\nback, or you'll just fall to the floor, screaming in pain,<br/>\ncovering your head. If you fight back, we'll have to decide who<br/>\nwins. Since the game is not about winning or losing, but about<br/>\ncreating good stories, this is seldom (never) a problem. You and I<br/>\nwill resolve this ourselves, knowing that it is not the fight<br/>\nitself that is interesting, but its effect on the story. Our eyes<br/>\nwill meet while we mock-fight, and if you're not going to back<br/>\ndown, I'll see that clearly. Maybe I'll decide to run away, or get<br/>\nbeaten, or maybe I'll give you the same look back, and we keep<br/>\ngoing for another 30 seconds. Eventually, someone will lose, or I<br/>\nmight resolve the stand-off, by stopping the fight and offer to<br/>\nshake hands or call it a draw. Whatever.</p>\n<p>Same thing with inappropriate actions. Pretending to rape someone<br/>\ngenerally is crap role play, so we'll probably resort to other<br/>\nways of doing this. Say your character drugs me and rapes me.<br/>\nRather than you pretending to do me and look silly, maybe we'll<br/>\ncut to a monologue: "When I awoke, he was all over me..." or<br/>\nsomething like that. You get the point. Maybe we'll have both our<br/>\nmonologues at the same time. Or we just skip the whole event.</p>\n<p>If there was a long build-up, we might want to play it out more<br/>\nlarp-like, but most likely not. It depends on both our preferences,<br/>\nthe situation, what kind of innapropriate action it is, and how<br/>\nserious the game is. Etc.</p>\n<p>If I want your character and mine to go beat up the old man by the<br/>\nbar, I'll say "Let's go and beat up the old guy in the bar."</p>\n<p>In teams that often play together, they will develop skills to<br/>\npick up on signals, develop home-brewed methods for fighting,<br/>\netc. Generally, such methods are easily transferred to other<br/>\nplayers -- when you see it it is obvious.</p>\n<p>Player-to-player communication can be handled either by breaking<br/>\ncharacter and talking about what is happening, either quietly<br/>\nwhile someone else has focus, or there might be a few short breaks<br/>\nthat allow you to agree on a common focus and direction for the<br/>\ngame, etc. Preferably you don't use those methods -- you generally<br/>\nget very far in terms of player-to-player communication by just<br/>\nusing nods, eye contact, pointing and touching. Also, you tend to<br/>\n"speak your mind", like in movies: "I wonder if the door is locked<br/>\nor not", or "Let's see, how many bullets do I have left", and the<br/>\nGM immediately shows nine fingers.</p>\n<p>The role of the GM varies a lot. Sometimes, the GM is just an<br/>\ninformed audience that gives the players thumbs up and can quickly<br/>\nresolve problems that might arise. For example, telegraphing goes<br/>\nwrong and the GM realises that one player has not grasped the fact<br/>\nthat they have now moved into the building. The GM will set this<br/>\nstraight by quickly stating, "Ben, we're <em>in</em> the building", or<br/>\ngives a quick hint like "It is a lot warmer indoors" or something<br/>\nthat makes the player realise where the scene is taking place.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the game is one big scene, or there might be shorter<br/>\nscenes and the GM (or the players) cut the scenes at different<br/>\npoints and move on to the next one.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, the GM will have a character to play, like the GM's<br/>\nplaying Dad in No Sign of Alex. In Doubt, the GM's task is mostly<br/>\nto set up the game, prevent the players from getting stuck between<br/>\nthe scenes, and keeping them honest by holding her monologues.</p>\n<p>The GM has absolute power, almost never uses them. The GM is a<br/>\nfacilitator, makes sure the game progresses in a good way, and<br/>\ncoordinates. As the GM is generally not playing a character, she<br/>\nhas a birds-eye perspective on what happens and can help the<br/>\nplayers create a good story by facilitating coordination. "Now<br/>\nwould be a good time for X to happen, so I'll suggest that."<br/>\nSuggest is key here. The GM most likely wont say "You fall in love<br/>\nwith Mary", but perhaps whisper into your ear, loud enough for<br/>\neveryone to hear it but soft enough not to interrupt the game, "I<br/>\nthink there is something about Mary, don't you?".</p>\n<p>When I GM, I might say things like "If I were you, I'd ...", or<br/>\n"When I was young ..." or "An interesting thing about love is<br/>\n...". It might not be clear who <em>I</em> am and in what diegetic<br/>\ncapacity I'm talking, but that doesn't matter. It is input, trying<br/>\nto show the players an opening, a potential extension of a scene,<br/>\nor tell the players something.</p>\n<p>The GM does not have to be impartial. I actually prefer that she<br/>\nwasn't. The GM's input can have an agenda too. I like having the<br/>\nGM give all her input (like what a place is like, etc.) from the<br/>\nperspective of some other person, so that GM input is not<br/>\nobjectively true, but subject to interpretation. If the GM is a<br/>\ndope, then the description of this place might not be completely<br/>\ncorrect, right? "I'd take that pill if I were you..."</p>\n<p>Characters are generally free to go wherever and do whatever<br/>\nunless the game explicitly states otherwise. If Tom needs to have<br/>\nprepared a surprise dessert for Julia after their night out,<br/>\nnaturally he did. There is no need to ask for permission, just go<br/>\ninto the kitchen and get it. And if Tom's player isn't sure if it<br/>\nis OK given the premise of the game or current circumstances,<br/>\nhe'll say, "I bet there is something special for you in the<br/>\nkitchen", and then watch the GM's reaction to see whether it is<br/>\nthat romantic dessert, or if he is just wanting to get her out of<br/>\nthe room to scratch his groin.</p>\n<p>The GM is also a guy that can say "Oh, no! The car is getting out<br/>\nof control", or rather start shaking the imaginary wheel of the<br/>\nimaginary car that we built using four chairs from your kitchen.<br/>\nThat's all the input the driver needs and the players end up in<br/>\nthe ditch every time.</p>\n<p>So why do we build a car out of chairs? Well, we don't always do<br/>\nthat. But if we are going to play a <em>one hour</em> car ride, then it<br/>\ncould be a good idea. Generally, what we try to do is map the game<br/>\nworld onto the physical playing location because it helps<br/>\ntelegraphing. I can exit the car, and you'll all understand that,<br/>\nwithout saying a single word that interrupts your back-seat<br/>\nquarrel. Etc. If we agree enough on this mapping for the<br/>\nunderstanding to be somewhat consistent, then there'll be no need<br/>\nto talk with the GM to understand if I can hear what you are<br/>\nsaying in secrecy just one meter away, etc.</p>\n<p>I hope this gave you a better picture of what <em>playing</em> can be<br/>\nlike.</p>\n<p>Don't hesistate to ask any follow-up questions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97694/#Comment_97694" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T22:34:20+00:00" title="September 19, 2007 10:34PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tobias: Thanks!

Also, unification of players and audience brings something extra.

It turn out that isn't so).<br/><br/>So, when he will be able to respond (having recovered from the effects of the end-of-Con feast - with associated rivers of wine, whose effect you can easily see in my spelling tonigh, too) I would like to return to the examination of the game "Doubt", with a sort of "Doubt companion: the things a Doubt GM should know that weren't in the game books" and the other changes he use these days to run it...  ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101179/#Comment_101179" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T20:45:14+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  8:45PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mmm...  after he returned from Modcon it seems that Tobias is no longer in this forum.

The reason for cutting out the casting scene was purely to gain time since the game started late even by Italian standards. That was cheap fat to cut. <br/><br/>Unless something goes terribly wrong, I *will* be at Dreamation. JiffyCon in Noveber seems highly unlikely, though. <br/><br/>Matthijs -- I've not officially left anything. Oh, and I saw you're on the authors' list for Fastaval. That's great stuff!

I guess different different playing cultures tap into playing GURPS (or what have you) with different preconceptions. I think one difference between the games you list and Jeep style of play is that we capitalise on the powers of physical and build that into the game. Modulo your personal preferences, I'd expect that a off-the-shelf GURPS scenario could be played equally well with or without physical acting.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>So, if I understand Tobias correctly, a better description of Jeep would be "improvisational theatre, with a <br/>\n  story, a setting, and characters, with a moderator." Closer?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I think that role-playing looks more like improv from the outside than it is from the inside, but let's not be splitting hairs. I think you are closer, but my latest game has neither a setting, characters or a moderator and is still to my mind a Jeep game. There is also not a pre-defined story, if that is what you mean by story.</p>\n<p>It is true that most Jeep games have a moderator, but it is not necessary. Same thing with characters. If there is a good reason to remove characters, then that's OK. Etc.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102915/#Comment_102915" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-13T14:31:27+00:00" title="October 13, 2007  2:31PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Tobias.

These can be expanded upon in play, but in order to focus the potential story on the themes I wish to explore, I need to be as determinate as possible.
