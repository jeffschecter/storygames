Most of these were original worlds or ones attached to particular games (like <i>Cyberpunk</i>), but a few media-based games poked their heads in.  One of these in particular stands out because it's resurfaced with me from time to time as something I'd like to run, but have no idea how.<br/><br/>The game in question: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan's_Run" rel="nofollow">Logan's Run</a>.  And for the purposes of this discussion you should probably take a few moments to read the basic theme of the novel before continuing, because I'm going to pretty much assume you're familiar with it.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you only know the book through the movie adaptation then you only have half the story.  The novel has a much more expansive palette to draw from.  The movie has humanity confined to domed cities and, perhaps more significantly, sets the maximum age a person can live to 30 years, which makes a real difference in terms of the character maturity.  The novel turns the dial down to 21 and posits an entire world dominated by the immature, the pleasure-seeking and those possessed of the callousness of youth.<br/><br/>My vaguely formed idea was that players would occupy the roles of Sandmen, those men \u2014 and, I presume, women though we see none in the book \u2014 who hunt down and kill those members of society who refuse to have themselves euthanized on their twenty-first birthday.<br/><br/>Looking back on this game concept I see some problems with it, largely because I couldn't think far beyond the base situation, much as with <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11341" rel="nofollow">my idea to play in the world of <i>Blade Runner</i></a>.  The setting of <i>Logan's Run</i> is fascinating and complex, but how to engage the players in that as much as with the hunting and killing of Runners?  And how to stay away from simply restaging the events of the novel?<br/><br/>With all these questions hanging over my head, and no easy answers, the <i>Logan's Run</i> game has remained just an idea, not a serious contender for the next thing I'll run.<br/><br/>I figure I can't be alone in this.  Media properties are an attractive ground for play because if you find the world interesting it's more or less defined for you, thus eliminating the need to do the heavy lifting necessary for play in a brand-new world of your own devising.  Surely someone else has their own <i>Logan's Run</i> out there.  What's yours?<br/><br/>And if you have any ideas for how to make <i>Logan's Run</i> a going concern, gaming-wise, I'd love to hear them.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachlan" title="lachlan"><img alt="lachlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachlan">lachlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255372/#Comment_255372" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-07T07:34:52+00:00" title="February  7, 2010  7:34AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Logan's Run would need short attention spans, self-centeredness, and pleasure...but also ways for PCs to struggle against that, if they want to change the world. Go look at pleasure games, like Bacchanal, or at games where you're fighting your own dark nature, like, well, Bacchanal. Take a look at 'Grimm' or 'Innocents'  -- the character development of Grimm assumes that the kids are going to grow up (I think they go to 6th level then they're gone, and that definite end-point is a finish line, not a punishment), and Innocents has rules for the shorter attention span of a child -- and both work. In a Wicked Age has some stuff, but players will need to read the book. Who else has a finish line? I'm thinking Montsegur:1244, only with lots of casual sex.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

(The novel has a sequel called <i>Logan's World</i>, though I haven't read it yet, and it seems like hardly anyone has.) That's something that comes up in character-driven anime too. For example, I really like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_Captor_Sakura" rel="nofollow">Card Captor Sakura</a> (a manga by CLAMP), but while it hints at a very interesting world with wizards doing all kinds of things behind the scenes, the manga is pretty much entirely about what Sakura and the people immediately around her are doing, and unless you use those characters directly, any RPG adaptation is going to involve filling in a ton of setting elements yourself.<br/><br/>I would take a very close look at what it is about <i>Logan's Run</i> that you want to game. To me it's an intriguing setting, but the stories it suggests are all basically about how characters might come to understand the horror of the world they live in and try to fight it. That doesn't necessarily mean the PCs would have to be Sandmen, but it still strongly points to doing the same general kind of thing as the source material.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255384/#Comment_255384" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-07T09:34:31+00:00" title="February  7, 2010  9:34AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for running <i>Logan's Run</i>, <i>Paranoia</i> (XP, in my humble opinion) might actually fit the bill.

Everyone knows that's a <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_%28novel%29" rel="nofollow">Dune</a></i> game, but instead of having to deal with canon and all that nonsense, they strip out all the minutiae, and just present the core of what's good about that novel in Luke's eyes.<br/><br/>It's what I was going for when I asked <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8578" rel="nofollow">What's cool about Star Wars?</a> right here back in (wow!) January of 09. It's what I'm going for for the <i><a href="http://www.fox.com/dollhouse/" rel="nofollow">Dollhouse</a></i>, <i><a href="http://www.hbo.com/generation-kill/index.html" rel="nofollow">Generation Kill</a></i>, and <i><a href="http://www.syfy.com/battlestar/" rel="nofollow">Battlestar Galactica</a></i> games I'm planning on writing.<br/><br/>When you do the non-canon/what's-cool way, you don't have to deal with what it means to say "we're not playing in canon." See, maybe the most important part of <i>Star Wars</i>, the thing that makes it <i>Star Wars</i>, to me, is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_%28Star_Wars%29#Midi-chlorians_and_the_Chosen_One" rel="nofollow">midi-chlorians</a>. It's not that series if that's not there. But for you, midi-chlorians are like having your childhood raped. Instead of having to "deal" with midi-chlorians, they're only in there if the game designer includes or if some mechanism allows the players to build midi-chlorians into the game.<br/><br/>In other words, all setting material is additive, and you only include canon if it occurs to you, and you design into the game what's important about the property rather than being concerned with replicating all of it accurately.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261240/#Comment_261240" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T11:21:41+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 11:21AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>In that case Book of the New Sun cannot be gamed.</p>\n<p>What's important about it is the deceptive clarity of the writing; how layers of story emerge from what is at first brush simple pulp fantasy with a thesaurus.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261242/#Comment_261242" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T11:23:17+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 11:23AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite>Surely someone else has their own<i>Logan's Run</i>out there.

(Probably very, very stupid stories; I was too young to tell at the time.)<br/><br/>It's been a very long time since I read the book, but IIRC there were other societies outside the city, and a big mostly-abandoned post-apocalyptic world. Wasn't the climax set in a ruined Washington DC? Is that where "Fallout 3" got the idea from? Seems you could do stuff with that, too.<br/><br/>Similarly with "Blade Runner", you could go back to the source book, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" and find all sorts of setting elements that are missing or only hinted at in the film: the bizarre VR religion of Mercerism, the Penfield Mood Organ, the near-extinction of animals and the social prestige of owning one, the inevitable gray market in fake robotic animals that gives the novel its title. I can't even remember if they kept the population collapse of Earth \u2014 in the movie the city seemed pretty crowded, but in the book the whole world was the way Detroit is now, due to massive emigration. (And if you want to know what life on the colonies is like, Dick wrote several novels and stories set on Mars, like "Martian Time-Slip", that tie in somewhat.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JAR" title="JAR"><img alt="JAR" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JAR">JAR</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261347/#Comment_261347" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T15:54:16+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  3:54PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2010 3:56PM by JAR.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a wild stab in the dark here, but I'm guessing Bethesda Softworks got the idea for setting their game in a ruined Washington, D.C. from being based maybe ten minutes walk from Washington, D.C.

Certainly the limits on storytelling are much tighter in the movie-based setting, since the film concentrates all of humanity into big domes sealed off from the outside.  Coming at it from the perspective the book allows for a broader selection of stories since you have the whole world to play with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
