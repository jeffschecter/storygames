It was great. Very easy to pick up and play with a group of people with varying levels of experience with RPGs (but all familiar with Fiasco, which helped). We each had the PDF rulebook on our phones, which was a good solution although paper copies would have been ideal. The fact that each player has their own "script" for each kind of mini-game really helped keep the focus on the game - we only had one or two brief off-topic/table talk moments in a 3.5 hour session which is pretty astonishing by my standards.<br/><br/>We had Josh, call-sign "Zippy," a brash, bro-y officer proudly taking his first command in the ruthless corporation Bantraforce's internal security squad, Kaz, a veteran private military corp officer working for Unicorn Consolidated Content, a poweful entertainment conglomerate, Princess Ranna, the aging matriarch of the noble Rozarian family, a genuinely skilled mobile frame pilot and swordswoman, and dancer with a squad of by preening, useless dilettantes, and Corben, a grizzled farmer and unwitting revolutionary captain unwilling to compromise his vision of a people's republic.<br/><br/>The most innovative and compelling thing about the game is the way that conflict is premised on taking turns presenting your opponent with explicit opportunities to hurt you. This inversion of the standard approach is scary at first but actually kind of exhilarating when you get used to it, and it really helps put telling a good story first.<br/><br/>One thing we could have done more/better (and the rulebook could be a little bit more explicit about) is how/when to introduce NPCs. Some of the minigames, especially A Tactical Skirmish, are best with named NPCs with some established narrative or background in the story. Easy enough to remedy for next time, though.<br/><br/>We rushed the ending a bit due to time constraints, but one of the cool things about the mini-games is that any of them can be invested with climactic weight if necessary. A Tactical Skirmish between two pairs of tenuously-allied pilots ended with the Landowner corporations claiming the land that was theirs be legal writ, the Bantraesh nobility barricading themselves in their palace, and the Revolutionaries going to ground after realizing that allying with the nobility was a huge mistake.<br/><br/>But to be clear: the Bantral system is <i>absolutely not</i> at war.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454538/#Comment_454538" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-03T03:10:29+00:00" title="July  3, 2016  3:10AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds very interesting!<br/><br/>Can you explain this bit:\n<blockquote><br/>The most innovative and compelling thing about the game is the way that conflict is premised on taking turns presenting your opponent with explicit opportunities to hurt you.

The attacker makes the first demand. When you make a demand, you choose whether to demand submission or withdrawal. In your demand, you must name yourself, one of your own soldiers, or one of your enemy\u2019s declared objectives. </blockquote>\nThe demands are all phrased like this:\n<blockquote><br/>\xbb Submit / withdraw now, or you catch \u2014 at an inattentive moment and cut them to pieces. <br/>\xbb Submit / withdraw now, or you\u2019re able to concentrate fire on \u2014 and gun them down. <br/>\xbb Submit / withdraw now, or \u2014, my least-experienced soldier, surrenders to your mercy. </blockquote>\nAnd then you narrate based on those cues and your opponent's responses to your demands how the skirmish plays out, until only one side is left.<br/><br/>See what I mean about offering your opponent opportunities to hurt you? The kicker is, every time you choose NOT to surrender or withdraw, you have to make another demand and thus offer your opponent another opportunity to hurt you.<br/><br/>(Incidentally, it's this mini-game in particular that requires NPCs that have a name and some development, since it's more interesting to offer up your cousin and second in command than Unnamed Mook 3#.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454568/#Comment_454568" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-03T23:49:24+00:00" title="July  3, 2016 11:49PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, interesting!<br/><br/>So, effectively, when you make a demand of your opponent, you offer them something they can take from you.<br/><br/>This seems like a no-brainer, except that if the person denies your demand, they know they will have to offer you something in turn.<br/><br/>A more traditional way would be to say:<br/><br/>On your turn, you can choose to give in to your opponent's demands.

I wouldn't have even known about it if not for the Friends at the Table episodes! Looking forward to hear how it goes at your table/picnic blanket.\n<blockquote>Oh, interesting!<br/><br/>So, effectively, when you make a demand of your opponent, you offer them something they can take from you.<br/><br/>This seems like a no-brainer, except that if the person denies your demand, they know they will have to offer you something in turn.<br/><br/>A more traditional way would be to say:<br/><br/>On your turn, you can choose to give in to your opponent's demands.

This makes for a pretty intense game, especially if you have well-developed PC/NPC relationships. As for your different formulation (if I'm understanding your question), I don't know that it would make too much difference, but the original formulation is more consistent with how the rest of the game is written.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ScottM" title="ScottM"><img alt="ScottM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/141/358751423_eee4729c81_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ScottM">ScottM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454778/#Comment_454778" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T01:13:49+00:00" title="July  8, 2016  1:13AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played it for the first time this last weekend.
