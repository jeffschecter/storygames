The game is choosing loyalty or savagery, exercising faith or cynicism, and achieving salvation or starvation.<br/><br/>What makes it special:<br/><br/>1) Your dogs play the game with you.  You play the fictional dogs and narrate happenings, while your actual dogs represent every other character involved in your challenges -- e.g., friars, orphans, Rain Dogs, drug barons, what have you.<br/><br/>1a) Competitive mechanics consist of playing fetch, chase, and training/bribing your dogs to perform a rain dance.<br/><br/>2) Every time the mission bell rings, whatever happens next is recalled or repeated every time the bell rings in the future.  Grudges flair, another orphan goes missing, and friars debate whether eating a pet is a sin.<br/><br/><br/>I figured this would be good for a laugh anyway.  But I do wonder if a game for both canine and human players might be feasible.  I see it as something you could play in your backyard while barbecuing.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
