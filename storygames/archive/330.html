<p>So, uh, the idea behind this is to basically have a neat combat system where your decisions have clear systematic consequences, even when you are "just" jockeying for position or staing, "I am not left-handed either!" or any such thing.</p>
<h1>How It Works</h1>
<p>Every "action" in this system is underlyingly offensive; by doing anything at all you are threatening your opponent. We accomplish this by saying that an action <em>"sets a trap,"</em> which, you hope, your opponent will trigger sometime in the future (by taking some action), or that it will constrain his choices if he tries to avoid it. "Trap" is used fairly loosely here; if you take an action such as <em>Climb the Crumbling Stairs,</em> then you may be setting a trap with the trigger and effect, "When your opponent uses any <em>Approach</em> action, you can roll Athletics to try and knock him down, which causes the <em>Approach</em> to fail." (You see here that <em>Approach</em> has become a category of similar actions.)</p>
<p>Put another way, all actions are defined by when and how they are dangerous for your opponent. Some (the Stairs example above is obviously one) are also defined by when they are possible to use.</p>
<h1>What You Do</h1>
<p>When it's your turn, you take exactly one action, and along the way you resolve and traps you sprung. Then you move on to the next character.</p>
<h1>What This Needs</h1>
<p>For this to work in a sane way, you need a closed set of generic action categories, and probably a good deal of other stuff. That's why it's a Little Idea!</p>
<h1>The Cool Bits</h1>
<p>I think the actions that are specifically connected to the environment are the best bit about this, here, and the potential that it has for inserting idiosyncratic actions that allow you to do Funky Stuff: <em>Approach by Flight:</em> This is like <em>Approach,</em> but you don't set off traps that are based on Athletics.</p>

                            It's nice. I like the idea of actions being traps.<br/>
<br/>
Are you envisioning the players trying to trap each other, rather than a GM trying to trap the players? Because the players trying to trap each other is great.<br/>
<br/>
Just to clarify, does an action always imply the same trap? So the Climbing Stairs action always sets the trap for Approach actions? And so that means that, when an action is declared, everyone knows what trap has been set?<br/>
<br/>
As a quick thought: you could always do something so that "Traps" are written on paper at the same time as "Actions" are declared. So that you say "I'm climbing the stairs"; and you write on a piece of paper "Setting trap: Pushing down the stairs"; so that when I declare I'm approaching, you show me your piece of paper and go "You've just triggered a trap".<br/>

<p>Graham, traps have to be overt, 'cause half the work they are doing is serving as a deterrent or coercion to make the opponent choose actions. I generally assume a GMless design.</p>

                            Ah, nice.  You know what's the best part about this?  This is how fencing basically works.  It's not about skewering the other guy, it's about setting up a situation in which the other guy can't do anything without getting skewered.<br/><br/>This also, and I think this is a huge advantage of this system, allows a character to realize he has no options left and <em>give up</em> instead of keep going till he's dead.  A little less death is a good thing, IMHO.                        </div>

If so, what prevents someone from avoiding the trapsetting altogether? What benefit does trapsetting have over direct offense?                        </div>

<p>There needn't be an explicit endgame - the system leads organically to either "someone can't fight anymore" or "someone stops taking actions because otherwise he will trigger an unacceptable trap." Naturally there aren't non-trapping actions or any such thing that disrupts the tempo; even "I swing a sword at him" is clearly a trap that triggers on "any action that doesn't prevent the sword making contact."</p>

                            I think what Stuart is getting at, Shreyas, is that you can trap a guy down to having no options, at which point he sits there and seethes.  What actually determines that he's beaten?  Or is it like a checkmate thing, where there are only a finite number of actions available to characters at any time, and since he has no potential actions, he's beaten?<br/>
<br/>
How you translate that state into the roleplaying fiction is also an interesting question -- is he beaten body and soul, or is he just sitting there seething with rage?  Does he go quietly from there, or does he wait until he has potential actions again and lashes out?                        </div>

<p>Ah, thanks for casting that as a question I can answer.</p>
<p>I don't like designing inescapable things, so I would probably include just one action that isn't in the trigger set of any other action, calling it "Surrender" or some such. Maybe Surrender allows you to choose exactly one trap and trip it, and all the others are disarmed, and you've lost whatever was at stake for the conflict - I'm assuming that a stake was set explicitly earlier. So when you've run out of good options, you can surrender and at least get away with your dignity.</p>
<p>The hidden assumption I have here is that, while the game process is very deliberate, I want this to look very energetic and fast-paced, descriptively. <em>Is it even possible</em> to take no action? I suspect that it isn't, or if it is then it is nearly always the least optimal choice because of actions like "hit with sword" that have negative triggers.</p>

Thanks for putting it that way. I was asking several questions at once.<br/>
<br/>
Shreyas,<br/>
<br/>
A related query:<br/>
<br/>
So what, for example, could be the effect of the trap, "I swing my sword at him?" Could it include, "He dies?"<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like the effects of traps are, essentially, mini-stakes, but from what you've written, it sounds like the overarching conflict also has explicit stakes set. What happens if these conflict? Can you set a trap that, if tripped, essentially nullifies the stakes set for the conflict as a whole? Building on my previous example, could you engage someone with the stakes being that he is, say, demoralized and surrenders, but then kill that person when he sets off a trap?<br/>
<br/>
...or are the only stakes that are set those that are the results of trap-setting? (this option makes more sense to me...)                        </div>

<p>Well, that's hard to say without a context, so let's contextualise it. Suppose we are using my wuxia thingy to play Snow From Korea. Then, the stake of every conflict is, "One of your relationships takes one increment of damage."</p>
<p>Then, in the course of the conflict, you can maybe negotiate, alter, or specify this stake further, but fundamentally it's on a different level than what the combat system cares about.</p>
<p>I don't really mind the system getting in the way of stakes, though; I am sort of fond of systems that are able to provide impersonal adversity this way. Isn't it kind of neat when someone in a story tries to accomplish something and, in going too far, it destroys him?</p>

                            I wonder if you might set up a couple of parts to the system, within your overall setup:<br/>
<br/>
Attacks:  Move to (this stance).  Your opponent must do one of (these Attacks and Defences), or (this effect) happens.<br/>
<br/>
Stances: Offer you a list of things you can do--(these Attacks and Defences) <br/>
<br/>
Defences: Move to (this stance).  Set a trap against (this Action).<br/>
<br/>
This means that you have to completely box all the character's actions  in, but rather can chase the character to a stance where all the possible responses are cut off.                        </div>
