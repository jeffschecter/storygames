It would probably lead to a kind of ownership feeling from players ("This is my kingdom of Kalaya").<br/><br/>...Or, the collaborative version (this one shamelessly stolen from Fred):\n<ul>\n<li>Each player starts with N chips</li>\n<li>The first player asks a question about the map (place, label, whatever). He's the only one that cannot answer the question.</li>\n<li> One of the other players pays one chip, and answers the question.</li>\n<li> The player that answered last, pays one chip and asks another question.</li>\n<li> ...and so on.</li>\n</ul>\nIn this case the N would be much lower I guess.<br/><br/>Both procedures, I think, need some more spice added to them... so, what would you change/do?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131745/#Comment_131745" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T14:15:23+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  2:15PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite>The player with highest number of chips has the right to write a name in a label and estabilish a fact about that place<br/>The player that "won" spends his chips, the others keep them.</blockquote>\nI think that I would somehow add in an element to this setup, where the number of chips spent did wasn't just used for who gets to declare a spot, but also on how much impact that will have -- a spot someone paid 4 chips for should be somehow "twice" as (important/story-impacting/mechanically-interesting/something) as a spot someone paid 2 for.<br/><br/>Maybe there's even a split bet -- one to be the person who says what it is, but another (at the same time) to be the person directly involved/impacted/affected.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131747/#Comment_131747" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T14:41:27+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  2:41PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was thinking about a betting mechanic to allow people that <em>really</em> want to, say, name this or that region to pay more and secure it.<br/><br/>Another option would be stealing from Greg Stolze's ...in spaaaace!, and have <em>all</em> the chips go away only at some condition.
