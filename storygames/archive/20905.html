Sure, he's trying to leave presents for everyone, but the world just isn't as simple as "naughty" and "nice" anymore. Everything's kinda turned shades of grey, you know? (And, no, we don't mean <i>that book</i>, though the Claus does leave it in people's stockings a whole lot.)<br/><br/>Worse yet, he's not just out of touch. He's getting old. Fat. He drinks a lot. His mind's not what it used to be.<br/><br/>Each home he visits... well, sometimes it's as simple as broken chimney. But sometimes it's the wrong gift altogether, like a credit card for little six-year-old Johnny, or their weird aunt's pornography collection somehow ends up at grandma's. Did he knock over that Donald Trump tree-topper while the Democrat cousin was visiting? Oh dear. He didn't even notice.<br/><br/>In any case, in his wake... things aren't quite right. <br/><br/>After the Claus has passed... people are angry. Words are exchanged, then blows, then a broken bottle of rum cuts someone. A mess. Almost every freaking time.<br/><br/>An accident, some collateral damage, leads to Accusations. Those lead to Injustice. And Injustice? Often leads to Crime or Sin, it turns out. (And some say that enough of that and the Demons might show up, though that's a point we argue a lot. Maybe it's just the humans's base nature?)<br/><br/>So, who's to clean up the mess?<br/><br/>Well, that's us. The Elves. <br/><br/>We don't know too much about human nature, adult stuff, politics. Sex, drugs, infidelity, hate crimes? We don't really *get* that stuff, you know? But we have to deal with the problem - who else can?<br/><br/>First, we try Talking.<br/>Then, it's Physical.<br/>If that fails, it comes to Fighting. (We're quick, not super strong, but the reindeer are wild and dangerous, and we can bring them in for backup.)<br/>Finally, though, we have magic. We can... <i>change</i> people. It's not pretty, so we try not to. It hurts the world in some way, makes everything ugly.<br/><br/>And only the little children believe us. Adults think we're monsters, at best; they certainly won't listen to reason unless we can trick them or they're drunk or stoned.<br/><br/>It's down to us to solve the problems left behind.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
