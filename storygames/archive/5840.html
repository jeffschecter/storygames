No one's in charge. You have a sheet in front of you, with spaces on it, like "Location", "Character 1", "Character 1: Relationship", etc. Maybe a total of 10 spaces or so. There's no preset setting or anything.<br/><br/>You need to fill out this sheet, as a group. I need a mechanic that works quickly and encourages: 1) things that go together well, and 2) things that people like, think are cool, make sense, etc. Silly ideas or ideas that don't fit with the others should be eliminated (preferably, they never make it onto the sheet in the first place), and, ideally, the people whose ideas do make it can get rewarded for it (don't worry about the currency).<br/><br/>At the end, you should be able to look at the sheet and see how all the stuff belongs together in the same story.<br/><br/>Ideas? What works well? What is good to avoid? <br/><br/>Remember, it needs to be a quick process (5-10 minutes).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

And being worried about thinking deeply about anything you might say would effectively discourage a creative mood. And maybe that silly idea inspired someone else a good or cool idea.<br/><br/>So I'd say don't say "silly ideas should be eliminated". Instead I'd say "Keep a serious approach. Ideas would only be kept by general consensus." That way you are saying them coming up with foolish stuff isn't the idea, but that they are not forced to only come up with the best ideas. And in the end, you'll only use the good ones.

Wow!<br/><br/>The method that has worked for me in the past (which I learned from Judd) is to pitch 3 shows, just a basic sketch of each. When I've produced, I've been able to write down all the salient details on a note card. One of those three will "click" more than the other two, and it's USUALLY the second or third one. I'd say it takes about half an hour to go through this process, and each pitch is generating about the same amount of detail as you seem to be asking for (10 or so entries, right?) This is with the Producer saying "ok, lets move on" before people start getting really invested in a pitch.<br/><br/>So, maybe what you need is someone with the authority to say "thats it, lets move on" once each element is generated.

In the past, when our group has tried to do everything with brainstorming, we've run into all kinds of problems, starting with social ones (if one person seems psyched about his or her idea, everyone else shrugs and goes along with it, because they don't like telling friends they can't have what they want), moving through procedural ones (some people need or want time to think about their ideas, and/or respond poorly to being put on the spot), and continuing on to actual problems with the end result (a setting designed by committee, which by its very nature is hated by no one but not loved by anyone either).<br/><br/>As a result, we tend to do much more limited brainstorming these days; ideas are solicited for small features of things that have already been decided, and we tend to use back-channels (e-mail, out-of-game conversations, etc.) more than we do getting everyone around the table and yelling a lot.<br/><br/>So I guess what I'm saying is, here's some ideas from someone who's not in your target demographic, and if you feel like ignoring them, I'm okay with that.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>You have a sheet in front of you, with spaces on it, like "Location", "Character 1", "Character 1: Relationship", etc. Maybe a total of 10 spaces or so. There's no preset setting or anything.<br/><br/>You need to fill out this sheet, as a group. I need a mechanic that works quickly and encourages: 1) things that go together well, and 2) things that people like, think are cool, make sense, etc. Silly ideas or ideas that don't fit with the others should be eliminated (preferably, they never make it onto the sheet in the first place), and, ideally, the people whose ideas do make it can get rewarded for it (don't worry about the currency).</blockquote>\nIf I had to do this with our group, I'd settle the big overarching issue first -- what's the premise of this game?  What kind of tone are we going for?  Sketch in the borders of the setting before asking them to come up with ten items to put in that setting.<br/><br/>The next thing I'd do would be to put that important info into about one or two paragraphs, paper-clip a copy of the 10-things sheet to it, and hand one to every single person in the group to take home and think about until the next time we meet.  Let them fill in however much of it they feel like doing.<br/><br/>Now, out of our group of (let's say) 5 people, we've got as many as 50 things that we can all sit down and work with.  We can merge some things together, or throw out some stuff, or use some of it as a stepping stone to new ideas, or whatever.  Probably I wouldn't even bother with systematizing this part of the process, because I don't see how it would provide any advantage over just discussing it among ourselves.<br/><br/>Finally, we'd break out a fresh 10-things sheet and put only the ten best things that come out of that discussion onto it.  Maybe we'd do hamsterprophet's clever suggestion about immediately crumpling that sheet up and starting over with a new 10-things built off of it.  I like that idea!\n<blockquote>Remember, it needs to be a quick process (5-10 minutes).</blockquote>\nYeah, that won't happen.  Our games suck when no one invests in them, and to us the very definition of "no one will invest in this game" is "let's just slap it together in 5-10 minutes."  Our players are very much the slow-burn type -- the fun they have and the overall quality of the game increases if they have some time to build up enthusiasm for it.  Try and push it, and the game suffers.  (It might not <i>suck</i>, because they're smart and creative people, but it certainly won't be as good as what you'd get if you gave them some time to get psyched.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130677/#Comment_130677" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T17:49:32+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  5:49PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I'm getting a lot of answers along the lines of, "this is how I would prep for a good game with group input".<br/><br/>I'm trying to put this process together for something that's not really an RPG, has no "GM" or even "group organizer", and plays out in about an hour or an hour and a half. So, suggestions like "write up a few paragraphs, then have everyone think about it until next week", while possibly quite good, are not very useful to me.<br/><br/>So, please don't come into this discussion with "standard RPG" kinds of assumptions! Your ideas, however great, won't be very pertinent.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I realized that I haven't really explained what the "entries" will be like! They can be anything from one word to something like a IaWA oracle element (basically, one sentence).<br/><br/>What I'm looking to maximize is:<br/><br/>a) As little "wasted" brainstorming as possible. (This is the opposite, in many ways, of what most brainstorm processes encourage--maybe I need a different word?)<br/>b) The "bits" fit together coherently. Entries that don't play well with the others are put aside. (The effect being that the *players* end up on the same page as a result, as well.)<br/><br/><br/>(Sidenote: For what it's worth, I haven't seen any loss in quality or enthusiasm because of the quick setup. I wonder if this is a function of the games played or the psychology of the group. For instance, is it a type of "gamer baggage" to assume that a game put together in 5 or 10 minutes is _expected_ to be low-quality, or just the nature of the beast?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130684/#Comment_130684" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T18:16:16+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  6:16PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2008 6:27PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>So, suggestions like "write up a few paragraphs, then have everyone think about it until next week", while possibly quite good, are not very useful to me.</blockquote>\nWell, shit -- I <i>told</i> you that they were ideas from outside your target demographic and that you could ignore them.

I'm looking for feedback on it overall, and I have specific questions about it as well (see below).<br/><br/><b>Brainstorming</b><br/><br/>Decide on a general tone/genre. Just a one-sentence definition is fine. (Like, one person says, "how about an action adventure?" Another says, "The kind that takes place in Egypt in the 1930s?" "Yes!" And that's it.)<br/><br/>Take a piece of paper and label it "Brainstorming Sheet". (You already have a "final sheet", with all the categories that need to be filled written on it. That comes with the game.) <br/><br/>Each player writes down one element--anything that would fit in one of the appropriate categories. (If you have a small number of players, like 3 or 4, you may want to do two elements each, instead.)<br/><br/>From now on, players make suggestions in strict turn order. (You can decide who goes first randomly.)<br/><br/>First, a player picks out two elements that he or she feels work together well. If necessary, they can explain why.<br/><br/>*** (see footnote)<br/><br/>Two other players need to "second" their suggestion. If at least two of the players do, the elements are added to the final sheet. If only one person confirms the choice, or no one confirms it at all, the elements are not added to the final sheet. (The same suggestion can be made again later, however.)<br/><br/>Once the two first elements are in place, subsequent players can do one of the following: <br/><br/>1. Suggest two other elements from the Brainstorm Sheet that go well together (as above).<br/>2. Come up with some completely new element.<br/>3. Pick an element from the Brainstorm Sheet and suggest it be included.<br/><br/>For each suggestion, proceed as for the first one. If two or more players "second" the suggestion, it's in. If a player is suggesting a new element and it doesn't "make it through", they can add their idea to the Brainstorming Sheet, if they think it's good and might still get worked in later. Or they can just drop it. Maybe it was a bad idea.<br/><br/>Currency: Each time one of your elements ends up on the final sheet, draw a card from the deck.<br/><br/>Rules I'm also considering, but am not sure about: <br/><br/>--You can never make a suggestion that includes one or more of your own elements--only other players' elements are fair game. (Or, as above, but only true if you're suggesting a pair of elements. You can suggest one of your own anytime.)<br/>--Each time a suggestion of yours makes it onto the final sheet, you get a card, if it was an element someone else wrote. (This encourages people to suggest other people's elements that they like.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>***: Is there some good/democratic way to get this initial choice to be made? It's very important, and I can't think of any better way than "choose one player to start, they make a suggestion". Any ideas?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
