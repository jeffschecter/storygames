Since it's PbP, it's slow going and we have only made it off the Hand of Sorrow - but the players came up with great stuff while doing it. I can't remember reading about a Lady Blackbird group who managed to annoy the Empire quite so much in so little time. We have a Norman instead of a Naomi and Lexi Arkham instead of Kale (whom we wrote into the story as her father, unfortunately killed years earlier).<br/><br/>The group find themselves in a cell aboard the Hand of Sorrow, with their IDs being checked, a thought that worries everyone. Losing no time, Norman smashes a hole into the door, freeing them, but alerting the guards. Lexi slips out and places a small mechanical bug in one of the air vents - the bug produces copious amounts of smoke, buying them some time.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, two guards run into Norman, which ends deadly for one of them and the other one is knocked out (a young boy of about 18, 19 years). The Lady and Lexi dress in the uniforms and Snargle, looking through the boy's belonging, finds out that they have just taken Captain Hollas' son Basil hostage. Basil, when he comes round again offers to take them to the hangar through maintenance corridors, hoping to get them out with as little fuss as possible and maybe coming out of this alive.<br/><br/>So they make their way to the hangar, but Hollas' troops are already waiting there - the group's escape hasn't gone unnoticed and neither has the identity of their hostage. But the group has a plan for this. Snargle slips away to steal one of the small fighters and maybe tinker with the Essence tanks, while the Lady asks Vance to shoot a hole into one of the steam lines so that she can create some cover for them. The resulting explosion destroys half of the fighters, kills or maims quite a number of soldiers and no-one can hear anything for the next few minutes. But the Lady still is able to use her magic to create a wall of fog covering more than half the hangar. By now, Basil has positively begged to be taken along when they escape, he seems to believe that he will be executed for his role in all this should he be left behind.<br/><br/>Snargle has climbed up into the hangar after the explosion and is surprised by a mechanic, another goblin. A short fight later the other goblin is unconscious in the pilot seat of one of the remaining fighters and Snargle choses another. Lexi and Norman, the first to enter the hangar, are just in time to see the last of Hollas' troops withdraw and get a smile and salute from Hollas himself, as if they were meeting at some party, before the captain steps out of the hangar and closes the door behind him. They create a short circuit to open the hangar doors and this works just as planned.<br/><br/>Not planned: the fighter the unconscious goblin is trapped in has powered up (Snargle has hit the wrong button by accident) and smashes into the one next to it - another explosion waiting to happen. Snargle in his fighter and the Owl make it out just in time before the Essence in the fighters' tanks catches fire. The Owl is not targeted by the Hand of Sorrow's flak, but Snargle's fighter very much is. Nonetheless, they manage to escape and are now on their way to Atlas 4, a mining station occupied by goblins - they can just about make it there with the last of the coals.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you happen to be one of the players, stop reading NOW<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hollas could have stopped the group, sure. But he really, really wants to get rid of his son. It's just that having him killed or suffer an accident on board the Hand of Sorrow would be inconvenient, too many questions. But if Basil is kidnapped by some rogue pirates? Another story altogether.<br/>And so Vance finds a data crystal in his quarters once they have time to relax a bit. On it is a recording of Hollas, who offers him a deal: kill Basil and get paid a substantial amount of money. Leave the body somewhere it will be found within a week. Refuse to kill the boy and the money will be a bounty on their heads. Of course the data crystal plays this message only once and then comes up empty. <br/><br/>To my surprise, Vance's player has actually kept silent about all this. He doesn't seem to plan to kill Basil, but he hasn't told his crew about the offer either. I don't know what the player is going to do, but I do know that there will be wanted posters everywhere once they reach Haven, with a lot of zeros above not very flattering portraits of Vance, Snargle and Lexi.<br/><br/>I have no idea really where this story is going, I haven't planned anything at all and so far it works great. I do have ideas what might happen of course, but I'm just as happy to be completely blindsided by the stuff my players come up with - like: 'hey, let's have the soldier be Hollas' son!'<br/>If you read German, here's <a href="http://aves-reich.de/index.php?f=209" rel="nofollow">our forum</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421645/#Comment_421645" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-18T10:04:51+00:00" title="September 18, 2013 10:04AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, that's great!

Since she has no former experience, she feels free to just do stuff, without thinking 'am I allowed?'. Some of the other players, all long-time gamers, had a harder time with this and it took some getting used to the idea that they can just bring things up and invent story elements.<br/><br/>For me as a GM, Lady Blackbird is pretty much ideal because I tend to wing it anyway, I never plan very much. Just some general ideas, I love improvising and running with ideas the players add to the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bookscorpion" title="bookscorpion"><img alt="bookscorpion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/690/nR7DFBX3C4KX7.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bookscorpion">bookscorpion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424048/#Comment_424048" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-11T02:12:09+00:00" title="November 11, 2013  2:12AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've come a bit further in the story. After wrecking the Hand of Sorrow, Snargle suggested Atlas 4, an abandoned mining colony as a rets stop. A goblin clan has taken over the asteroid, so they can do business with them to get supplies and spare parts, not to mention fuel.<br/>The welcome is a bit frosty because anyone landing with a stolen Imperial fighter in tow is probably bringing trouble, but the goblins agree to give them what they need, if only to get rid of them as soon as possible. Since goblins live in a matriarchal culture, the goblin they talk to is a woman and she adresses Lexi, just assuming that she's the captain. Lexi just runs with it and degrades Cyrus to a passenger and Norman is suddenly their cook. <br/>Snargle is warned to stay with the group or something unpleasant might happen - it seems goblins who have left their clan are not treated kindly here. He expected no different, though.<br/><br/>Negotiations are combined with dinner. The crew eats the strange soup and spicy cread with varying degrees of enjoyment/distrust. Norman attracts the attention of some goblin children and soon he's involved in a playfight - the kids want to tale the giant prisoner. And the kids have no problem with Snargle, he's made part of the game as well. That's fun until he realises that pretty much every adult goblin in the dinner hall stares at him with cold disapproval. He walks out, very calmly, and stays on the Owl for the rest of the time.<br/><br/>Before they leave, a young goblin asks Cyrus to take a package with letters with him to Haven and deliver it there to the goblin's bother. Cyrus agrees.<br/><br/>------------<br/><br/>When I brought up the package, it was just letters. In no time, one of the players had a theory that it contains rebel propaganda and plans (I would have been disappointed if no-one had thought of that). But I'm treating it as Schroedinger's package for now, until someone opens it or they actually deliver it. <br/><br/>Cyrus' player finally decided to share Captain Hollas attempt at blackmail with the others and I'm very curious to see what they will do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
