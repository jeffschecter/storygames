I've been working on an experimental comic project called Dragon Pulp. The gist is that each update ends in a poll where the readers choose which direction the story goes... it's somewhere between a webcomic and an old choose-your-adventure story where the choice is crowd-sourced. I try to give at least three options that lead in different directions- sometimes the difference is a matter of nuance, but I try to make the story hinge on each decision as often as possible without hurting the pacing.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the readers/players consistently chose the option I was the least prepared for. Ahh.... just like gaming.<br/><br/>From an RPG design perspective, the system is crude: the creative control from the readers is limited to the options I give to them, and even then their vote is only one of several. As the writer, I have the ability to choose the consequences of the group's choice- which theoretically means I could easily railroad all of the choices... but half the fun is sharing creative control.<br/><br/>I started out assuming that the best approach would be to have event-based votes: 'what does character X do?' or 'Is action Y successful?', but I've been learning that the more fun approach is to let the readers/players dictate characterization: 'how does character X feel about what just happened?'. The latter option has the extra benefit of being a huge indication of how rounded the characters feel ("character X is obviously the villain, eh? let's see if we can sneak in something that makes it possible to empathize with him" or "character Y is obviously the hero, eh? let's see if we can sneak some moral ambiguity into him").<br/><br/>This first story had a bit of a learning curve to it, so I imagine the second one will be a little stronger, but still... it's an overall success so far. If you'd like to join in, you can hop over to www.Dragonpulp.com. You can vote through the website, but I also send out a weekly e-mail with the installment and vote embedded into it (which is how most of the readers get it).<br/><br/>The first story is barreling towards its climactic conflict (since the tension of the story depends on the uncertainty of the vote, I had to make sure the hero was developed enough that the final conflict would have him torn between several different choices).                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384239/#Comment_384239" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-03T14:14:24+00:00" title="July  3, 2012  2:14PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fun stuff!

I originally wanted to make it a series of short stories, with each being 5 installments or less so people could easily jump in at any point- but when I came to the end of the first one, the popular consensus was "wait a sec... he's not dead yet... come back and finish this story." It turns out the readers wanted to spend enough time with a character to develop an attachment to them. Shoulda seen that one coming.<br/><br/>When this story ends, I'll probably switch gears and start a new one. Since I'll be aiming for novella length instead of short story, I'll be able to structure it a little better...<br/><br/>The current story's structure was cobbled together last minute since I had planned on ending it around installment 4... the readers caught me off guard... but that's what happens when two groups with disparate creative agendas share creative control, eh? I might've handled it a bit better, but I'm chalking that up to the learning curve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384359/#Comment_384359" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-05T11:13:45+00:00" title="July  5, 2012 11:13AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2012 11:15AM by thor.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nevermind, I didn't see the link the first time. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doplegager" title="doplegager"><img alt="doplegager" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doplegager">doplegager</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384406/#Comment_384406" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-05T23:47:30+00:00" title="July  5, 2012 11:47PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah...
