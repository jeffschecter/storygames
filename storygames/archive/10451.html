The game starts during the middle ages. The PCs are ordinary people coming from all spheres of society. They discover that they are in fact were-animals and are taken over by a mysterious Grand Veneur (the Hunt Master) who leads a gypsie caravan where, in fact, all people are like the PCs. The Grand Veneur is the GM character. The players don't even have a character sheet and know nothing of the rules. All is hidden behind the screen. The game was in fact a campaign through all french History where the PCs became more and more aware that the world was in fact a dream or a game until all players could become GM. The Grand Veneur was a mysterious character and I think he wasn't supposed to interfere much in the PCs story.<br/><br/><br/>In the japanese RPG Ryuutama, the GM has a character, the Ryuujin (dragon person). You choose your Ryuujin from 4 races of different color. Each race of dragon is more suited to a specific kind of campaign : red dragon is for war stories with lots of fights, black dragon is for dark stories with lots of sorcery and treasons, blue dragon are for regular adventures of discovery, travel, etc..., green dragons are for human drama. Each type of dragon has artifacts and breath powers that helps the kind of story you want as a GM... I think. Because I am still struggling with this chapter of the rules... The Ryuujin can interfere in the story to help the PCs or hinder them but there are advices against to much of that. In the end, the Ryuujin is there to help the PCs to live interesting travel tales, because the greater Season's Dragons that rule the world feed and prosper on good travel stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232440/#Comment_232440" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T07:46:58+00:00" title="September 15, 2009  7:46AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, I forgot about the dispatcher in Ninja Burger.

The GM says, "Today I am a Black Dragon", and the players know it's going down with the backstabby, poison and twisted social conflicts. Or "In the next adventure I'm thinking Red Dragon", which will be about war and struggle. Kinda like an Oracle, but with no set results.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232492/#Comment_232492" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T13:32:26+00:00" title="September 15, 2009  1:32PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm running a PBEM Engle Matrix Game about a Cthulhu story in "Salem's Creek" Southern Indiana. I'm championing Klaus Schnelling (a cultist thug for the mayor/evil genius). Players say what actions happen next and the referee (me) decides how likely they are to happen. They may also make counter-arguments to each action. When I make an action I pick another player to be my referee. In face to face games the referee role can float around to any player so of course wveryone is playing characters. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the John Maddon example - he would say they were being attacked but another player would say how likely that was to be true. A dice roll would settle it. More fair but you have to admit the instant replay joke was funny.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
