The Forge is a game design community, right? <br/><br/>You used the phrase "RPG publishing scene," in the context of First Thoughts posts. I assume that's synonymous with my use of "community." If you meant what you said, then why? Why doesn't the scene need warm welcome (and your implication is that warm welcome hurts the scene)?<br/><br/>Is warm welcome a good first step toward fostering good design? Yes. It builds rapport with people. Rapport helps you communicate. People will more willingly hear criticism from someone they trust. People will trust someone with whom they have built rapport more than someone who is being seemingly mean to them. If you really want people to take your criticism to heart, deliver the message in a way that is most likely to be <i>accepted</i>, not just heard. I don't think that means delivered with a baseball bat. The bat makes sure you'll be noticed, but it almost assures they won't listen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219001/#Comment_219001" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T10:24:56+00:00" title="July 17, 2009 10:24AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Yeah, I do think being hard on wannabe designers is a good first step toward weeding out crap.</blockquote>\nWait, so we're not trying to help people?

The rules and culture of the First Thoughts forum is insufficient to make this determination. The amount of detail the particular person provided when prompted was insufficient.<br/><br/>When I read the initial post, I was almost convinced the poster was a 14-15 years old who'd watched Babylon 5 or DS9, and wanted to play some character from the series or "tell similar stories", while mixing in tropes from other genres and games, without having considered how it'd work in play at all. The mention that he'd played RPGs for 15+ years but never found a setting he'd like to play in was the only indication that I was wrong. If he'd been playing with the kind of parameters he implied in his own posts for 15+ years, I think I know why it's been unsatisfactory to him ("epic" world but without PC agency, d20-style system but modified with no classes and emphasizing skills, etc).<br/><br/>So, the "kid" in question is probably my age (30+) or older, but it seems - from our ivory towers, at least - as though he's had a long-running series of incoherent games with a group that has placed emphasis on Colour and Character and remained ignorant of other game elements such as a coherent System and particularly Situation. Why, when Actual Play requires you to provide some background of the personalities involved and the particulars of the medium by which the game was played to provide context to the report, does nobody in this First Thoughts thread challenge the poster to provide context to his game? Who are you? What experiences in particular have you been dissatisfied with - provide actual play examples? Who are the people you have been playing with? What games have you played, how have you played them, and for how long? How do you foresee the actual play of this game will proceed (round-robin scene framing, GM-led frame-by-frame play, one big combat encounter per play session and then play-by-post character interaction between sessions, etc)?<br/><br/>I agree in principle that tough love is the way to go. Nobody in this hobby has ever actually benefited from sugar-coated feedback, and there is certainly no lack of enthusiasm for game design, setting authoring or hacking/modding out there. But I have a 13-year old son with a stated interest in game design, and his idea of a good game is one where WH40K Tyranids co-exist with Bleach demon-hunters and Naruto kid ninjas in a Rifts-like "anything goes" universe, all overseen by an all-powerful GM who willy-nilly hands out "Prestige Points" to players he likes to use for advancement purposes. If he went on The Forge and posted his ideas, I'd want someone to say "hey, tell me about your gaming experiences and your design goals first - by the way, have you ever played Rifts, because it's possible you could just use that instead, also, you may want to check out these earlier Forge threads on the subject". I wouldn't want some wheel-burning motherfucker tell him his ideas stink and why doesn't he just go write fanfic and stop bothering the role-players (not to say that's what happened in this case, of course).<br/><br/>Context matters. Adam's notion of interaction with people in different game design stratas is sound, but you have to know <i>who is where</i> to do that, and modify your interactions accordingly. It is not educationally valuable to treat someone you don't know as a peer by default.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219015/#Comment_219015" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T10:44:08+00:00" title="July 17, 2009 10:44AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Yeah, I do think being hard on wannabe designers is a good first step toward weeding out crap.</blockquote>\nWait, so we're not trying to help people? We're trying to weed out the crap?<br/>One plausible way of helping someone is to show them very quickly that they will not produce a good design without a <i>lot</i> of work. For at least some people, this realization will save quite a bit of effort and frustration because they'll choose a different hobby with which they'll have more fun. For others it will save them effort and frustration as they skip over large chunks of time which would have been spent developing bad ideas and move to developing good ideas. For still others it will cause them to abandon the design hobby/profession/whatever when they would have been really good at it and have had a lot of fun, because of their initial turn-off. (and other effects, other classes of people, of course)<br/><br/>You can't dismiss any of these. You can make a case for the third happening too often to justify the others, or the others being well worth the third, but at that point its a matter of <i>evidence</i>, not just spouting opinion.

A "proper" educational system, of any sort, for what we do is probably a ways away, if it's coming at all.

If you're saying, "fuck being a decent human being; their design sucks," then we don't have much common ground for discussion.<br/><br/>Yeah, sometimes the "target" doesn't get it.

It'd be nicer if it was grounded on an AP experience he could relay and posted in the AP forum, but I certainly wouldn't be throwing rocks and calling foul.

class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>You may have quickly forgotten, but the vigorous discussions there changed the landscape of RPG design. So there's no reason to think that it cannot still produce good. To my mind, it's just laziness to wave your hand and say, "Those difficult, game-changing, thought-provoking discussions? They worked in 2003, but they'd never work now."</blockquote>\nNo forgetting from me, just recognition that the change has happened. Those <i>particular</i> game-changing, thought-provoking discussions are indeed unrepeatable, of course they are. They were made of who and what they were made of, and that was in large part a function of time, context, and some amount of accident. That's how intellectual communities have always happened - think the Inklings, for starters. The internet has brought a lot more power to such communities, but they've also brought a lot of pitfalls, including the invitation to ossify their infrastructures when the community's infrastructural needs have actually changed.<br/><br/>Game-changing, thought-provoking discussions can still happen, with a lot of the same people even. A lot of the same ideas made at the Forge are still going to be at the heart of those conversations. But the context needs to change, the same way the contexts of all intellectual conversations-in-the-large that have ever happened have changed: flexibly, with time and the human lives of those involved, and without attachment. There are going to be a lot more children of the Forge, many of them will be different, and a few will be demonstrably better (for more narrow mission statements maybe... but maybe not).<br/><br/>When the RPG Theory forums closed on the Forge, Ron Edwards said somewhere that the Forge was entering its autumn, and he'd be with it through its winter to the end. Not to invoke some books I haven't read, but lately I feel like winter is coming. If I'm right - and yeah, that's an if - then it's laziness not to prepare.<br/><br/>Luke, if you haven't read that Clay Shirky essay I linked, you should peep it. I think you'll find it fascinating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219139/#Comment_219139" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T14:34:10+00:00" title="July 17, 2009  2:34PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mis,<br/>This sounds like very melodramatic rationalization. Through the shimmery haze of cigar smoke, I can just make out your red velvet smoking jacket. Or wait, are you the young punk telling us that six years ago is dead? Because the intellectual community certainly hasn't moved over here. <br/><br/>Kids still post over there in droves. Their bad ideas are reinforced more often than not. As I demonstrated, it takes minimal effort to poke a hole in those bad ideas and see some good come out of it. If you don't want to post over there any more, that's fine.

His conclusions supported both of the main lines of argument here: rudeness in offering correction hinders "micro-creativity" (I.e., offering new ideas) but so does uncritical agreement. But the factor that he identified as most powerful in explaining new idea generation is _justification_: explaining your critical assessment of what's been offered by others, or the reasoning behind your own contribution. To the extent tha( talking about game design and solving algebra problems as a group are analogous processes, there's a useful communication principle in there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219143/#Comment_219143" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T14:43:45+00:00" title="July 17, 2009  2:43PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2009 2:46PM by misuba.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hell no, it hasn't moved here.

What you're doing isn't the problem; where you're doing it... isn't really the problem either, or at least, we can't change its nature. Forums will simply always set up certain properties that are going to bring you into conflict with stupid noobs and lessen the odds that they'll hear you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219221/#Comment_219221" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T21:39:21+00:00" title="July 17, 2009  9:39PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>I also LOVE the implication that I am not a positive, contributing member to the community and that I don't go out of my way to help people with their fucking terrible ideas.</blockquote>\nIf i had a dollar for every time luke has helped me with a really fucking terrible game idea i would probably have enough dollars to publish them all in glossy hardcover special editions.
