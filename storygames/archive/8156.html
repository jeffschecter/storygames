The rules basically encourage you to blindfold, handcuff and break the knees of someone (using other stats and manipulation) who you want to best in an attribute contest where they are higher than you. In the end, it's up to the GM if they succeed or not, but slavishly following the number regardless of circumstance was exactly what the game was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> about, nor the behavior it was meant to encourage. Hmmm.<br/><br/>Unless it was Benedict. Then he'd still kick your ass. The place you kidnapped him to, and where you handcuffed him? He used suggestion to make sure you brought him there. It looks like a warehouse, but it's actually his secret ninja fortress, where ninjas spill out of the walls to surround you.<br/><br/>But then they step back, because Benedict simply gets up, snaps his knees back into place, and proceeds to kick your ass in a one on one fight anyway, blindfolded and handcuffed.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/unlikelylass" title="unlikelylass"><img alt="unlikelylass" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/danaellijohnson/SH5C2Orf01I/AAAAAAAAAFk/gbu1XwxZFyE/s144/dana-tiny.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/unlikelylass">unlikelylass</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179506/#Comment_179506" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-20T12:47:56+00:00" title="November 20, 2008 12:47PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Diceless (or more accurately 'fortune-less') systems are just not some people's cup of tea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey definitely aren't mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always found Amber far more an interesting historical artifact, inspiration, and good read, but not actually a system I was chomping at the bit to run or play in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI happen to personally agree with Marhault, but that has everything to do with my personal taste and nothing to do with the larger merits of the system.

(No such thing as a singular system, that is.)<br><br>There is Amber Diceless Roleplaying -- roleplaying, without dice, in the Amber setting.<br><br>But there is no single resolution system; each and every Amber game uses a fundamentally different resolution system, which can be summarized with this formula:\n<blockquote>Where <i><b>x</b></i> = Conflict result, and <b><i>n</i></b> = GM's name, <i><b>x</b></i> = "<b><i>n</i></b> decides."</blockquote>\nDue to the fact that whatever <b><i>n</i></b> decides, how <b><i>n</i></b> decides it, and how you as the player can get <b><i>n</i></b> to give you a favorable outcome is in no way comparable, predictable, or consistent between different instances of <b><i>n</i></b>, there is no example-based evidence that the system presented in the book carries into Actual Play in any consistent way; every single Amber DRPG group is playing with a different resolution system from every other ADRPG group.  Conclusion, no official ADRPG system exists in anything but theory (read: text).<br><br>((For instance, in the example Mickey gives, given <b><i>identical</i></b> facts about the scene, six different GMs will give 6 different results, <i>multiplied</i> by the number of different players in each play group, because each player will get different responses from the same GM in identical situations.  I, for example, don't give a fuck if the guy tied up is Benedict or not -- lots of other GMs do (see Andy's reply for an example), and also give different weight to the other elements in the scene. Ad infinitum, ad nausea.))<br><br>--<br/><br/>Which isn't to say I think the game isn't historically valuable -- it is perhaps the first RPG that gave serious authorship rights to the players.  However, that authorship has very little to do with the system (you merely had to spend points in one of several authorship-granting powers), and everything to do with the setting itself: you were playing characters who can define their world at will, so the players were given authorship via proxy.<br/><br/>I think many people gravitated to Amber when it came out because of the kind of group collaboration it (the setting, not the system) allowed.<br/><br/>I maintain that any game system that accurately reflects that level of world-changing ability in the characters can be used to play in that setting.   In my opinion, there is no pre-existing 'Official system' for such a homebrew to compete against.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179513/#Comment_179513" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-20T13:09:28+00:00" title="November 20, 2008  1:09PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah,  Amber was mind blowing and paradigm shifting stuff for its day.

Perhaps I should reread the books, but they seemed like pretty run-of-the-mill American paperback fantasy literature to me. The game was an awfully heavy affair of long character histories, boring point-based chargen and nothing happening ever, unless you counted the fact that I had lots of time to read miscellaneus rpg books while the GM plotted in private with the other players. There was some sort of unspoken gamist assumption in the game or some such: the characters were all one family, but insanely suspicious of each other as well. I never quite figured it out, but my guess in retrospect would be that the game was supposed to be a combination of competitive gamism and heavy character immersion. Perhaps I should get the game text itself and read it through, it might explain to me what the GM was trying to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179516/#Comment_179516" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-20T13:17:38+00:00" title="November 20, 2008  1:17PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2008 1:19PM by Doyce.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nope, Eero, I think you got it in one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule" title="GeekGirlsRule"><img alt="GeekGirlsRule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule">GeekGirlsRule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179518/#Comment_179518" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-20T13:21:03+00:00" title="November 20, 2008  1:21PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The whole plot of the books hinges on the fact that none of the siblings trust one another and are constantly scheming against one another.

Not because you haven't got it - you've got it.  But because the meat of the game, the thing that made it work, is the stuff that wouldn't fit on Ralph's playing card.  Which is almost all in the <i>examples and advice</i>.<br/><br/>Most games start as a formal structure of rules, and (unfold?  collapse?  move?) into being an informal body of action as people play them hard over a long period.

Oh, and secretly the players will probably all try to make characters that are cooler than the other PCs because the PCs are the real lasting measure of other PCs, but we will NEVER SAY THAT and may even say that doing it is bad." <br/><br/>Amber: "So the GM is a black box and the players have to stick together and fight each other and mostly get compared to each other. Make up your own universe, cause hell why not, but use these three central points (Patern, Logrus, NPC elder family members) to make sure you're all still in the same universe with each other.

The Amber is easily on my top 12 (or 10, or probably 5) games that everybody should read, because Wujcik broke a lot of boundaries with it and did some things that had never been done before.  The Attribute Auction is especially brilliant.<br><br>Amber is my ultimate System Does Matter game. I've run 3 campaigns, played in 1, and everything that happened that was awesome in all of them came from either Zelazny, me, you, or us as players.  The game fails to support me in play in every conceivable way from the moment character creation is finished.<br><br/>So, the root of the comment I made in the other thread, which Bob quotes, is that while the game gives you a good setup for the next generation, it doesn't help you do anything with them.  The conflict resolution really boils down to GM fiat.  It is a direct Karma based stat comparison except that you are supposed to include Stuff and fictional positioning in the outcome as well.  As the GM, it is your call to decide whether being blinded, handcuffed and kneebroken is enough to allow a 3rd rank character to overcome a 1st rank character.  Is that enough?  Okay, what about just handcuffed?  What about the sun is in your eyes?  If it's my call, it's GM Fiat.  Ralph and Doyce put it better than I can.<br/><br/>Essentially, the game put me in this situation. Anytime I wanted to frame a PC into a conflict that is not with another PC (or to a lesser extent, pre-statted NPC) I had to decide whether the PC would win, lose, or draw. I had to decide it outright. I already know the PC scores, and would just have to say yes or no. With an NPC, I just had to say, (s)he is better at X than Drago, worse than Fabrizio, and better at Y than Edwin, but not as good as Constantine. Again, the decision was all in my court.<br/><br/>So, deep flaws?  Yeah, there really are. Has the cutting edge moved away?  Yeah.  Like ten years ago, if not more.  But more importantly, the game never really provided a complete framework for play.  Is it that another game does better what does this one tried to do?  Not really, but knowing what we know now it wouldn't be hard.<br/><br/>I'll read and reply more later on or tomorrow, but that's the gist of my (bad) feelings about the game.  We should talk about the attribute auction later, because there's serious gold in it to be mined.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179543/#Comment_179543" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-20T14:06:04+00:00" title="November 20, 2008  2:06PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brand nails it.

So (a) people avoid ever getting into them or (b) filibuster their way through them on sheer bullheadedness. I think this is because the game is so schizophrenic about whether the main deal is inter-sibling conflict or exploration.<br/><br/>I always felt punished for engaging in pure exploration OR ever getting into any sort of conflict I had not already built a sufficiently overwhelming advantage for that its conclusion was obvious to everybody from step 1. Generally speaking, in most of the games I've been in, even interacting with the other players was flirting with massive deprotagonisation. You were much better off engaging in trivial solitary exploration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179555/#Comment_179555" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-20T14:42:36+00:00" title="November 20, 2008  2:42PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never played Amber ... no idea why, I have friends who love it, I've been *in* an Amber-con (though not at it as it were), but I'd totally recommend reading the hell out of it.

And in my experience, most players prefer to resolve those situations either by not getting into them in the first place (becoming sufficiently strong not to ever need to negotiate or compromise, or just lying really low and sneaking around conflict); by simply filibustering (we end up with a 45-minute intractable, sullen "debate" between 2+ people, neither of whom will give an inch unless forced); or by force.<br/><br/>It's because pretty much all agreements, compromises, or heck, relationships are presumed to have all kinds of hidden landmines, doublecrosses, and secret agendas attached to them, and they *will* get used to screw you later, inevitably.<br/><br/>Not every player will do this, but it only takes a few to make a group incredibly wary - and sometimes the most dangerous ones are the ones who can talk you into anything, make it seem reasonable, and never even let you know that it was them that screwed you later.<br/><br/>The key thing that drives bad Amber for me, has been the PvP.

I stab at it now:<br/><br/>The two big things I got, which I'm not seeing in your example, were...<br/><br/>(1) The things that you do which aren't intended to or expected to interact with the stuff of other PCs?  Those things don't matter.  They happen, yes.  And they are to be handled quickly, beacuse they are not the best bits.<br/><br/>(2) Our characters will have tension and mistrust, likely even conflict.  The meat is there.  As players, it is fun for us to dig into that tension, mistrust, and conflict - but if it's <i>all about</i> beating the other player for you, then all you're getting is the conflict; you're missing the juicy tension, which requires a fair degree of player cooperation, and is not served by you, player, being hypercompetive.<br/><br/>Now...<br/><br/>How much of that came to me, and to our table, by way of the text?  I don't know.  My instinctive answer is that a very big part of it did.

This:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>FWIW, that's only the case if you define "conflict" as "sword-fight, wrestling match, marathon or magical duel."<br/><br/>If you frame a PC into a conflict where (say) the stakes are "Do I convince this other PC not to trust this scheming bitch?" then you're equally unsupported by system, but nobody's calling on the GM to adjudicate.</blockquote>\nsounds to me like "Yeah, but you can freeform all that fun stuff!"  Which, yeah, you can.  Which means the rules aren't helping you do it, which is my point.<br/><br/>If I'm mischaracterizing, or misinterpreting you, say so.  I'm not trying to put words in your mouth.<br/><br/>Also, what Shreyas said is true for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179566/#Comment_179566" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-20T15:04:30+00:00" title="November 20, 2008  3:04PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2008 3:04PM by komradebob.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is the non-mechanical part of the book any good at aiding the freeforming part, though?<br/><br/>Andy and Levi seemed to indicate that it helped them, no?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179567/#Comment_179567" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-20T15:04:41+00:00" title="November 20, 2008  3:04PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds like all this game needs is a clear-cut mechanic for converting Positioning into Effectiveness.<br/>\n<br/>\nPossibly via the expenditure of a resource.

It could be very unfun at times due to that sort of thing.  I'd agree that the game as we played it was one where the emergent properties of the game was that it stopped being just Diceless but it almost seemed to have no rules at all.

Tony's "only if you define conflict as..." reminded me.  The game does an amazing thing with the attribute auction.  It says, right up front - "Here are your four arenas of conflict.  The people you're going to be in conflict with?  They're right here at the table with you.  The thing that determines who wins a conflict in a given arena is their rank in this auction that we're doing <i>right now</i>.  Do I hear ten points?"<br><br>That idea, that the game defines the arenas of conflict and that chargen puts you at the starting line as to where you stand with respect to the arenas, is hell-on-wheels, and this is where I learned it.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179576/#Comment_179576" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-20T15:18:48+00:00" title="November 20, 2008  3:18PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite>The two big things I got, which I'm not seeing in your example, were...<br><br>(1) The things that you do which aren't intended to or expected to interact with the stuff of other PCs?  Those things don't matter.  They happen, yes.  And they are to be handled quickly, beacuse they are not the best bits.<br><br>(2) Our characters will have tension and mistrust, likely even conflict.  The meat is there.  As players, it is fun for us to dig into that tension, mistrust, and conflict - but if it's<i>all about</i>beating the other player for you, then all you're getting is the conflict; you're missing the juicy tension, which requires a fair degree of player cooperation, and is not served by you, player, being hypercompetive.</br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nI would say - and this may point at your puzzlement - that what mostly happened is people <b>not internalizing</b> the text. Yeah, if I squint real hard, I can see the stuff you (or Rob D, who has done a lot to convince me that real actual people really enjoy this game) say is in there to make good play. But I would bet that if you asked most of the folks I've played with, they have a completely different interpretation of the text, based more on their own accumulated habits of "how to play RPGs" than anything that's actually in there. Because most of these are people I've played other games with (with varying levels of success), and they play essentially the same way in Rolemaster, D&amp;D, and Dogs in the Vineyard. Competitive as hell, bloody-minded, and ruthless OR hardcore immersive tending towards turtling. The thing is, in most other games, the structure of play places some limits around the conflict between PCs. ADRPG sanctions it fully - at least as interpreted by the folks I've played with.<br/><br/>As far as directly addressing your two points: these are both, in their own way, very much contrary to the established play habits for many of the players I've known. The more immersive, explor-y players LOVE to engage with minutiae and color at length and depth, and do tend to do a lot of play-before-play and solitary play. The hypercompetitive ones are that way in everything they play - usually covertly. And most of both groups would decry intentionally managing conflict for tension and drama as "unrealistic metagaming".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin" title="Kropotkin"><img alt="Kropotkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179577/#Comment_179577" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-20T15:18:50+00:00" title="November 20, 2008  3:18PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2008 3:19PM by Kropotkin.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Amber setting always seemed to cry out for something GMless--as that would entirely eliminate the plotting in the other room thing I mentioned above.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe ended up realizing that we wanted the swashbuckling and intrigue but that we'd become less enamored of the powers/power-game element.

It's a culture that speaks to how to make decisions - and one that assumes that you do get to make those decisions.  It wouldn't work as easily for, say, a game with dice, because those games assume (simply by including dice!) that you won't be making all the decisions.<br/><br/>That culture of play isn't formulated into rules, any more than the rules for getting great play with Transformers among six-years-olds are formulated...   Either you absorb it through the skin, seeing it in action, or you don't absorb it at all.  Which, to me, seems to be the great failing of the text - it's easy to "not absorb".<br/><br/>Hm.

Doing this right is much like building a wiki of the game together, it reinforces the fact that you're creating the world together, and are all responsible for bringing something for the game for the other players. It's an important hand-in-hand with the bidding system. <br/><br/>Of course, it too can go wrong. When I played Amber in high school one of the artists in the group ended up drawing Trumps for NPCs that were minor characters in his own branch of the story and never once drawing a picture of any other PC or the NPCs that were shared by multiple folks in the group. Being high school we avoided the issue for awhile, then had a fight about it. <br/><br/>But these days, were I to go back to it, I'm pretty sure we could avoid that pit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179609/#Comment_179609" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-20T18:29:27+00:00" title="November 20, 2008  6:29PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>That's how the rules given help you achieve the tense, conflicted atmosphere where trust is important but not easy.

I don't think that in itself is a problem, particularly if you allow yourself to buy into the black box model of GMing for the purposes of the game.<br/><br/>I've played it with players who trusted my judgement in determining the outcome of conflicts, and it's been enjoyable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179623/#Comment_179623" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T05:24:41+00:00" title="November 21, 2008  5:24AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 21, 2008 8:08AM by Scott.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marhault</cite>Hey Bob, you seem to be understanding my issues for the most part.

To me one of the most important tasks of the gm is to set expectation, clarify what 'canon' is being used and outline how you will adjucate conflicts. I'm not able to talk about system theory so someone going to need to help me 'translate' to have a conversation on that level. The simple fact is that I have run a lot of game systems and this game has been and continues to be a very good game for me and the people who play with me in just about any setting, genre, or play group. YMMV but I thought play experience was important. I just wish I knew better how to converse about this in the vocabulary and structure to help you understand what I get out of it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Edited to add the word 'theory' after system in the second sentence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179625/#Comment_179625" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T05:38:52+00:00" title="November 21, 2008  5:38AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pelgrane hit on something important. Adjucation come down to trust in amber. There may be some 'drive a truck through' holes in the rules but the players in my games know that I want them to have fun and look cool doing it. There are times when I ask them 'do you really want to do this'. Since amberites are supposedly smarter and faster than us I'll slow down the deliberations to make sure all the players get exactly what there looking to do. I will tell them that if you do this your character is able to anticipate that this will happen. They move with pretty sure knowledge through challenges. I teach my players to want to slow down and discover more when I don't give them these clues. I don't assume they know everything I will walk them through each conflict. This way no one feels hosed when they fail. They knew they would fail but they were in a social situation that made their choice the best of all the bad choices. I've heard the term "social meatgrinder" before and that's what my games are about.  It doesn't matter what your warfare is if killing them just is not an option.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179626/#Comment_179626" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T05:43:31+00:00" title="November 21, 2008  5:43AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That being said I'm working on houses of the blooded amber rules and I could see this becoming a lot of fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/No%20Love%20Orchestra" title="No Love Orchestra"><img alt="No Love Orchestra" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/No%20Love%20Orchestra">No Love Orchestra</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179627/#Comment_179627" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T06:37:44+00:00" title="November 21, 2008  6:37AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 21, 2008 6:38AM by No Love Orchestra.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Merhault">Merhault</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">As the GM, it is your call to decide whether being blinded, handcuffed and kneebroken is enough to allow a 3rd rank character to overcome a 1st rank character.

I'd call what you describe <i>GM discretion</i> and a perfectly valid technique of play. In experience I've found that people are pretty good at guesstimating these 'what would happen' situations in a way that accounts for both in-fiction and out-of-fiction variables in a reasonable way. I admit, Amber could be more clear on the basic assumptions of this method and perhaps divide authorial powers a bit differently but, hey, it was the first of it's kind and the power structure at the table kinda rhymes with the setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmber has definitely had a big impact on how I've played. When we play diceless, I still use much of the guidelines in the book.

D&amp;D is the only game I have PLAYED more than Amber.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I laid it down ages ago and swore I would never run it again.  The reason is the load it places on the GM.  Youa re a very real arbiter of every factor of conflict and that places you in a position where you are the crux of the Social Contract of the player gathered ina way that no other game seems to emulate.  Your biases determine what happens in teh shared imagined space - and they are alone in that.  The "rules" are guidelines for that, but the onus is on you in an increasingly uncomfortable way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd to this brew the fact that game encourages and rewards inter-player feuding, and you begin to have to take-sides in every inter-player dispute - dispute that is agreed to and encouraged by the setting and the general agreement of the players gathered.  You end up playing to favorite plotlines and favored players and it begins to become a strange narrative popularity contest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd to that the fact that the game is largely one where you are running a spereate game for each player that occasionally overlap, and the burden and onus on the GM are, to me, more trouble than they are worth in the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, though I have had many positive experiences with the game (or I would not have stayed with it so long), and hungered for the unlimited nature of what it offered me, I let it go.  I like a system that is more collaborative nowadays, and I can find unlimited color in many games now a days because (perhaps because of Amber) I feel very comfortable creating vivid and enjoyable settings (in fact, setting creation is the most fun part of gaming to me).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I ever return to running teh Amber universe, I will do so with a Solar System hack I have made to do so, or a FATE one, or with Mortal Coil.  All of those will do the trick without having to become the a-hole in residence to get things done.  I don't want a cult, I want a play group of collaborators.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Timothy" title="Timothy"><img alt="Timothy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Timothy">Timothy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179826/#Comment_179826" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T21:31:49+00:00" title="November 22, 2008  9:31PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, the revolutionary thing about the Amber game is that it is the first to really grasp non-supplemental play.<br/><br/>Now, I know I am making up a term, here, so bear with me for a paragraph, OK?  <br/><br/>What I mean by this is that before I'd played Amber, I'd played mostly D&amp;D, CoC and Pendragon, with a bit of Ars Magica.  None of these ever said "All you need to play -fully- is in this core book." All of them are based on supplement release.  I now write a fair bit for Ars Magica.  Actually unless the rankings have changed I'm the most prolific Ars author right now.  We have never really got to the point where we say "We define the game world to this point, and then after that, you and your players need to get your act together and talk.  We are writing for you, until X and then it is up to you."  Even though I really do know that for you, there must be a futility point where you as reader go "I have now read 2500 pages of Ars magica, and feel the need to read no more except as amusement."<br/><br/>Eric's the first author I saw who explicitly said "You will get this one book.  I will support you until this book ends.  Then you need to work it out for yourself, because you aren't going to get a supplement.  Well, you will get one for Chaos, but it won't have any useful rules in it for vanilla play.  So deal with it.  This is not a supplemental game."<br/><br/>And so I don't really agree with much of the criticism of the game in this thread.<br/><br/>Secondarily:  Sure there is no mechanism for forcing the GM to be fair.  For me, Amber was the first game that really said "You know what?  In AD&amp;D, there is no mechanism to force you to be fair either."  I suppose the big BE FAIR in red box D&amp;D should have given it away for me.<br/><br/>I have been royally screwed playing Amber by an unfair DM, sure.  I was part of one game that was utterly notorius for grabbing PBeM players from around the world so that the local group of the GM could chew through them.  I'm not saying "Amber is perfect!"  I am however saying that when I played D&amp;D4 at GenCon, the GM did a little victory dance at his total party kill and there was nothing in the reules that stopped him. <br/><br/>I am not really sure that rules to fix this problem exists: I think enforcement of GM fairness is social, rather than mechanical, and so the lack of fairness is just more obvious in Amber, and so, similarly, easier to deal with than in games where dice rolls hide behind screens and authorship lies with the GM anyway, so he can just chuck in more monsters.  If you TPK in Amber, indeed if you kill a single character, a player can say to you as GM: "Why did you choose this?" and you can't say "It was just the dice, baby.  It was just the dice."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179827/#Comment_179827" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T21:39:46+00:00" title="November 22, 2008  9:39PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because I totally didn't get this when I wasted a winter playing Amber, a question for you Amber players: when it is said that Amber is all about player vs. player struggle, what are the fictional end-points like? Do the characters kill each other or what? Or is there some creative torture involved first? Or is it more that they just fling really vicious insults at each other? I really am clueless here.<br/><br/>A sort of build-up question for that, of course, is why ever the characters would want to distrust and fight with each other in the first place. That's been sort of answered already, though: as I understand it, the rulebook instructs you to create characters who have reasons to hate each other despite being siblings and each other's only social peers in the multiverse. So players create a dysfunctional family of characters because otherwise there's not game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Timothy" title="Timothy"><img alt="Timothy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Timothy">Timothy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179831/#Comment_179831" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T21:59:36+00:00" title="November 22, 2008  9:59PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you -are- playing a game where it is PC struggle, then sure, in some games it finishes when everyone is dead: this is popular for tournaments.  The king dies, the players fight it out to be the new king.<br/><br/>If you are not playing this way, and a lot of us don't, then it ends when any normal story ends.  It depends on what, for you, is a normal story.  Either the villain is destroyed and there is a coda and you end, or for tragedies you watch the deaths of each of the PCs, Beowulf style.<br/><br/>Why do you create characters who don't trust each other?  You don't need to if you don't want to.  You may choose to.  In some games, you are explicitly asked to, in the same way that in my last game but one I asked everyone to tie in with a pirate theme.<br/><br/>If you do create characters with tension, you get something different to the standard "adventuring party fights villain" game, and that, IMO, takes a lot of weight off the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179837/#Comment_179837" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T23:47:24+00:00" title="November 22, 2008 11:47PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 22, 2008 11:48PM by JDCorley.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Often times the endpoint was that one of the characters got the objective by basically demonstrating their superiority sufficiently that the other characters voluntarily backed off.

Plus, as with a lot of soap operas, or as with a family, the fictional end points are often somewhat transitory and contingent. There are ends of arcs of story, shifts in status and relationship that may be lasting (at least for a long enough time to satisfy the players), and external pressures that come and go. But in the end you'll usually still have your family, and they'll still be your family. You may get along with your brother who you used to hate now, and be in a feud with your sister, and maybe that's the end. Or maybe it isn't. But you could end the game there, if you liked. <br/><br/>In other words, a lot of Amber play isn't about creating contained fiction, its about creating ongoing narrative and drama, and as such the end points are usually not going to be clear. <br/><br/>As to why the characters don't get along, again JD and Timothy had good to say. There is also the way (as Tony's pointed out) that the attribute auction starts a certain degree of competition between characters (and players). If you're second in warfare by one point, there's often going to be a tension between you and the guy who is better than you, and always has been, at the things you care about most. Also, the way that the elder Amberites get used in much of the setup, pushing their own agendas like medieval patriarchs through their whole bloodline, is going to put a lot of pressure on many characters. If you know Julian hates Corwin, and you're Corwin's son and another PC is Julian's daughter, and you know the elders are capable of fucking with your life without having to try too hard, then how much can you trust her? When will her father's plots cause her to betray you, on purpose or inadvertently? <br/><br/>Of course, a lot of this is very much in line with the things you talked about around Houses of the Blooded and relentless censure -- a little system pressure and a lot of fluff combine to get the group to censure themselves into cohering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179861/#Comment_179861" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-23T09:22:53+00:00" title="November 23, 2008  9:22AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are three mechanical issues which bug me with Amber.

Not in the "I can't do it" way, but in the "take some of this burden off me" way.  I don't want to be the decider for every conflict.  That's a shitload of work and responsibility.<br/><br/>For example, I once ran this Egyptian freeform game online.  Freeform in the sense that I, as the GM, decided everything.  So you can call it a Total GM Fiat game instead, if you want.  The characters were caught up in a storm of locusts, a plague summoned by the followers of Set who were attacking the temple.  They barricared themselves in a temple, then heard a scream outside.  One of the priests was being eaten alive by the locusts.  So all three characters ran out to carry him back inside.  The question for me was: do they get hurt?  Now, the odds are that some of them are going to get hurt, others aren't.  I struggled with the responsibility of pointing at one of the players and say, "Your character gets his ear chewed off by raging locusts," while pointing at another player and saying, "Your character gets away unscathed."  Or I could have had them all suffer the exact same consequences, but that was jarring for me, fiction-wise.  So how do I decide?  In that moment, I really wished for a die so I could just declare that I was going to roll it for each character, and the higher the number the worse their wounds from the locusts would be.  Easy, quick, and unbiased.<br/><br/>Amber might try to give me an out here with saying that usually, the higher number wins.  But I don't want always to have the burden of adjudication, trying to figure out every last detail, trying to remove myself from unconscious bias, and so on.  I want to delegate the final say to an independent mechanic.<br/><br/>If that sounds strange coming from the guy who co-wrote <i>Beast Hunters</i>, note how in that game, while the GM offers results for actions, the player can always decide to go to dice instead.  So the GM doesn't have to worry about making an offer that's too low, because the player will then simply use dice instead.  That's not just empowering for the player, it's a relief for the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179913/#Comment_179913" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-23T15:59:43+00:00" title="November 23, 2008  3:59PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And, all of this said ... if nobody thinks that there's an important <i>difference</i> between "You run through the hail of bullets unscathed" and "You take two bullets in the shoulder, and start bleeding freely," then that's another way to remove the pressure from the GM.  I don't feel a lot of pressure (for instance) deciding whether a given bar has fruity drinks with little umbrellas in them, because I <i>can't do it wrong</i>.  Similarly, when I've got a bunch of people who are playing Amber for the relationships and stuff like that, I don't feel a lot of pressure deciding whether they win a battle or lose it, because I trust that everyone will be equally stoked for any outcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's when people are looking to the Amber GM to uphold their sense of the <i>importantly correct outcome</i> that things get insane.  But, then, Amber is not alone in that regard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179920/#Comment_179920" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-23T16:30:30+00:00" title="November 23, 2008  4:30PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, <br><br>Very true. <br/><br/>Of course, I've also seen it where in the unimportant gunfight one guy takes a bullet, another doesn't, and then after the fight the second guy turns to the first and says "You always were too slow.

In Amber the answer is the character with the most Bad Stuff (all else being equal) is the one who loses an ear, while the one with the most Good Stuff is unscathed. It's better than a dice in fact, because it's a form of narratively relevant randomness. I liked that so much I do it in GURPS as well, and added an extra luck stat just so that I, as GM, was not forced to either decide such points myself or roll a dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8156/amber-diceless-doesnt-make-the-top-12-bucket-games" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8156/amber-diceless-doesnt-make-the-top-12-bucket-games" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8156/amber-diceless-doesnt-make-the-top-12-bucket-games/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F8156%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F8156%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
