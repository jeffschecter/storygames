Last time didn't go too well (and I think Graham still hates me a little for posting about it in public). This time, however, it worked like a charm. I really wanted to try it again, because I had a feeling it would work if played the right way, and it did. We had lots of fun - that is, we enjoyed the fuckedupness of our characters and their fates.<br/><br/>The things we did differently from last time, were:<br/><br/>1. Early on, there was a question from one of the players about how to decide whether to let an influence succeed or not. Should the decision be made based on the story, or on what's cool for your character? Now, for a lot of people the answer is obvious - meaning some people say "story, of course!" and others say "character, of course!" The way I'm used to playing, and you will find this in jeepform as well, is that "losing is fun!" If you hose your character, and push him/her into fucked up situations, that makes for fun play. However, in ATFM, we had much more fun rooting for our characters, and trying to resist influences etc. I think we all bonded with our characters, much more than was the case last time, because we actually wanted them to succeed. So, play your character, let the game worry about the story.<br/><br/>2. We read some portions of the setting out loud before the game, to get into the mood. <br/><br/>3. We went for more intense, close relationships, and had a pretty strong (and simple) dynamic from the start: A dominating mother; her son, the only one who could control her; his fiancee, who mother disapproved of; and his cousin, who was also his ex-lover. Good relationship maps with built-in dysfunction are probably vital. Obvious in hindsight, I guess.<br/><br/>4. We played tactically at times. As a victim, I picked the character I had no influence over, so I wouldn't lose any dice, for instance.<br/><br/>We ended up with some fairly intense conflicts and character issues; I was lucky enough to be chosen as the murderer. My character, the Mother, had killed her own son, because he wanted to sell off the estate. Her love for him was a virtue of necessity; "a mother loves her son". However, she really detested him for being so much like his father - that swine. And she identified completely with the estate - she'd do anything to protect it, like her mother and her mother before her had done. Beautiful, horrible tragedy.<br/><br/>So! Now I feel I know more about how to play, and what sort of expectations to meet the game with. Hope you do, too!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283032/#Comment_283032" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T21:28:33+00:00" title="July 26, 2010  9:28PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like a lot of good moves there.

Having perhaps one character a bit more off-kilter - the oft-mentioned american cousin, an eccentric uncle, the visiting bishop - can be cool, but you need that hard close set-up as your foundation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283034/#Comment_283034" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T21:42:07+00:00" title="July 26, 2010  9:42PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's cool you had a better game this time, Matthijs!

So we decided to go for two instead of three facts as the limit. That worked surprisingly well! <br/><br/>As I remember, we had this:<br/>- The fiancee only got one fact: She detested her fiance [in play: for being so weak-willed towards his mother].<br/>- The mother got two facts: She hated her son because he was so much like his father, that swine. AND he wanted to sell off the property, in pieces, to set up houses for... the working class.<br/>- The cousin got two facts: Years ago she had a child with the deceased (which he didn't know), who was adopted by someone. AND the deceased had accidentally killed the child without knowing it was his.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283060/#Comment_283060" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-27T02:43:27+00:00" title="July 27, 2010  2:43AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Frederik J.

There are a few things, in A Taste For Murder, that are left to the group to resolve. Here, the rules tell you the group should decide, but they don't quite explain<i>how</i>to decide. It's deliberate. It depends on the dynamic of the individual group.<br/><br/>So perhaps you'll come to a consensus. Perhaps you'll allow the investigated player a veto. Perhaps the most enthusiastic player will sway everyone else. The decision will work differently in every group.<br/><br/>I tried in two different ways, once with the final choice given to the player of the investigated character, and once with the choice by group consensus. This second way caused the must "funny" revelations, but not the funnier game: having to "reveal" something that everybody already know was boring, so after a while we skipped it.<br/><br/>If you care for the back-and-forth between the characters, I suggest having the investigated player decide what he will reveal (he can ask suggestions of course)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283105/#Comment_283105" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-27T11:16:57+00:00" title="July 27, 2010 11:16AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2010 11:18AM by Graham.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How fantastic.

The best advice, I think, is to ensure someone gets hurt when the relationship gets worse. Also, don't worry too much. Just go with the obvious thing.<br/><br/>So, for example: let's say your initial relationship is "She is pregnant by him". Well, the obvious way to make that worse is "He doesn't know". That's going to end up hurting someone. Don't worry, for the moment, why he doesn't know (did they have a drunken tryst? Or did she say she wasn't pregnant?).<br/><br/>Now to make it worse again. How about "She told him it was his father's baby?"? That's going to hurt <i>everyone</i>.<br/><br/>That seems bad enough, but we've got make it worse one more time. I can't make that father/son thing any worse, so let's go in a different direction: "The baby has an inherited disease". That's pretty nasty.<br/><br/>Note, too, how there are some <i>really</i> nasty things hovering around the fiction. It's possible to have "He raped her". It's possible to have "He is her brother". One deeply disturbing thing about A Taste For Murder is that, despite the gentility, it puts ideas like that into your mind. And, if you want to use those darker elements, they'll work within the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283111/#Comment_283111" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-27T11:48:10+00:00" title="July 27, 2010 11:48AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We definitely considered some darker secrets along the way.
