I started one game in which the PCs had all had some kind of scary dream set in London. They didn't have the same dreams, but I tied them together into a coherent threat and we started from there. Players can do a lot of the creative heavy lifting for you, the essential I think, with Mythos games, is to preserve some kind of mystery.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425005/#Comment_425005" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-30T03:39:50+00:00" title="November 30, 2013  3:39AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hasimir,<br/><br/>I would do this.<br/><br/>1. Read an HP Lovecraft story. A short one.<br/>2. Change the setting.<br/>3. Maybe change the creature.<br/>4. Run that. <br/><br/>This is potent stuff: it's amazing how far you can get by transplanting, say, <i>The Colour Out Of Space</i> to a seaside town.<br/><br/>Alongside that, I'd do this:<br/><br/>1. Start with them arriving somewhere weird. Let them wander around for a bit.<br/>2. Scatter some weird things around.<br/>3. Give them somewhere to explore, where things are weirder.<br/>5. Let them descend into some underground place, where things are really weird.<br/>6. Let them encounter the creature and run.<br/><br/>I think that <a href="https://plus.google.com/+GrahamWalmsley/posts/7TJqL2kPjdY" rel="nofollow">this is the best thing I have written on scenario preparation</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425012/#Comment_425012" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-30T11:49:03+00:00" title="November 30, 2013 11:49AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Graham for the advice ...
