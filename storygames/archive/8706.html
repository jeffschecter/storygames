I created a kind of one-sheet thing with my notes for the game, and then added a second page with some simple resolution rules, inspired by Vincent's Otherkind dice. Then I rounded it out with a few pieces of inspirational art grabbed from the interwebs.<br/><br/>When it was done, I had what I needed to run the game. Then I looked at it and wondered: Could someone else run a game with just this? It's kind of like an Oracle -- there's just enough to inspire, but it only presents questions; it doesn't answer them. You have to play it to get at the answers.<br/><br/>So, I'm calling it an "Oracle Game." It's got bits of color and situation like an oracle, plus a compact resolution mechanic. This one is called GHOST/ECHO and it looks like this:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ghostecho/ghostecho_021909.pdf" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ghostecho/ghostecho_preview.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><br/>Are you game to give it a try? If so, <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ghostecho/ghostecho_021909.pdf" rel="nofollow">download the pdf</a> and give it a go. I know what this material sparks in me, so I'd love to see what interpretations you and your groups bring to it.<br/><br/>I'm also interested in talking about the "oracle game" concept. In chatting with Judd about it, he had a great idea for a 2-page D&amp;D version. What do you think? Is this bare-bones, micro-game format something you've seen before? Is it functional?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/willem" title="willem"><img alt="willem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/willem">willem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192682/#Comment_192682" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-15T17:02:49+00:00" title="February 15, 2009  5:02PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude!

I meant in terms of lists of names and places with a few pictures.) <br/><br/>The thing I quite like is mandatory dangers for action types. It could make the action snap a little quicker, as there is sometimes a pause while coming up with dangers in Otherkindish games.<br/><br/>However, I don't think I know your inspiration sources well enough to make this one work for me.

Reading your bare bones mechanics reminds me of it a little bit.  I definitely really like the idea of dead simple micro-games like this.  It seems a bit like an super-American (as opposed to Nordic) take on the "roleplaying poem" concept, yeah?  Lots of awesome genre-fiction color wrapped around a clever mechanic or two.  Oh yeah, I can dig it.  Especially with layout like that.<br/><br/>P.S. Brand's right in that I think you need, like, two sentences worth of concept at the top.  Like: <i>dealers smuggle illegal psychic drugs in the bodies of mules, but one of the mules is secretly a cop.

In the first draft, I had a one sentence synopsis of the game idea (basically Shadowrun + Ghostbusters, in The Matrix), but I took it out. I figure, the color excites you enough to fill in the blanks and play it, or it doesn't and you give it a pass. I'm okay with either reaction. But maybe that's not the best approach. Maybe a touch more explanation would add more value to the piece.<br/><br/>Something to think about.

(Some games required printing and elaborate folding to be finished.)<br/>* The reader can be assumed to be an experienced roleplayer.<br/>* Lists of skills, items and such do not need to be complete, but enough examples should be given that readers can extrapolate the missing ones.<br/>* Only one single item of randomization may be used. One die OR one std deck of cards OR one coin.<br/>* Special cards are allowed, if they fit on the A4.<br/>* Character sheets may be used, and may be put on an additional A4, however no sheet may be bigger than double sided A6. So that four may be fit on one page.<br/>* Any world or setting may be used.<br/>* The game should be aimed at low or no prep games.<br/>* It should have rules.  'Freeform' or 'GM deciedes' are not enough.<br/><br/>Collections of such games were released after each competition.

To be honest, I wasn't really thinking "in the Matrix" either, just channeling a bit of the Wachowski style.<br/><br/>Mark: Yeah, that was my intention. Some rolls can result in harm, which then triggers the harm roll. The harm roll might also be directly triggered by fictional events, too (Poison'd style) but that's open to interpretation. Also open to interpretation: when you actually make the harm roll. Immediately? After the fight? etc.<br/><br/>Jamey: Thanks. Inside jokes are fun.<br/><br/>Matthew: That interpretation is totally valid. I think "How tough are the protagonists?" is a question that you'll have to answer in play, and the system is probably very malleable to a variety of answers. "What constitutes harm?" and "How serious/lengthy is incapacitation?" are other important bits.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>So almost everything you attempt there is a pretty big chance of one or two dangers coming true or partially true, especially if you want to have much of any chance of the goal actually being achieved?</blockquote>\nThat's the main consequence of the system, yeah.

Unfortunately, I'm still hung up on old school, traditional gaming habits. I'm doing my best to break those ingrained dependencies. But, just to satisfy my curiosity, how are others treating Harm? Is it physical harm to the character, affecting your dice rolls in some way? Or do you just work it into the fiction, narrating the damage, with no actual mechanical effect? I was thinking maybe have stages of physical Harm: Bruised, Injured, Disabled, Unconscious.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>//HARM EFFECTS</b><br/>\n+ Bruised: No mechanical effect. You're sore. And maybe a little humiliated.<br/>\n+ Injured: -1 on Die Rolls. Your injury has a slim chance of affecting your Actions.<br/>\n+ Disabled: -2 on Die Rolls. You've sustained a severe injury that seriously affects your ability.<br/>\n+ Unconscious: You can't go on without help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said, this is just the traditionalist in me.

That is to say, the harm isn't generic harm, we narrate something really specific. Like, if your "under pressure" thing is riding a motorcycle and leaping it from one rooftop to another, we won't just say "if you fail on that dice you'll take harm" we'll say something like "if you fail on that dice roll you'll wipe out and break your leg." Then if it happens we really graphically describe the break, how bad it is, what it looks like, what it feels like. <br><br>From then on if the character is doing something that involves their leg (like, say, walking) then its a narrative problem for them. They either have to explain how they deal with it, or make a "suffer harm" roll if they do anything strenuous. So if they want to run down a mark with their broken leg, they totally have to make a roll in which one of the dangers is that they're incapacitated. OTOH, if they'd broken their arm they wouldn't have to make the roll, so long as they aren't using the arm.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192913/#Comment_192913" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-17T09:30:55+00:00" title="February 17, 2009  9:30AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br><br>Apologies for more praise, but this thing is really cool.

I'm not saying that's a bad idea \u2014 the way I see it, almost any game can be improved by recasting it into <i>Puppetland</i> \u2014 just that it's what you're suggesting.  It does have the disadvantage of adding a karma-based resolution not already provided for in the rules, although that doesn't seem too objectionable to me as a potential player of GHOST/ECHO.<br/><br/>It leads me to my own suggestion: How about also importing <i>Puppetland</i>'s time limit rule, or something like it?  Let the brevity of the game design translate into an unremitting pace-dictation rule.<br/><br/>Also, I thought I might point out that there is a differentiation rule (ruloid?) on the sheet: "What ghost powers does your particular crew member posess?"  So differentiation might be "Hull can channel the Ghost Field to undo Harm, Coil can channel it to leap tall buildings, Vixen can trick and command Dogs..." or whatever your group decides.  Listening for Echoes might be another place where ghost powers come in: "Demon can read the local datastream for incoming Wraiths, Grip can find Loot...".<br/><br/>I could facilitate a small group in making a story with these elements in an hour, and have it be rewarding.  It could be the RPG equivalent of "Majesty of Colors," which I certainly am glad that I played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192996/#Comment_192996" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-17T18:08:20+00:00" title="February 17, 2009  6:08PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Colin's right, Mark.

The names themselves would be more indicators of humanity's tendency to try and fit the indescribable into familiar categories than apt descriptors ("Hawks" are what people call the flying Wraiths, "Vipers" the long and sinuous ones, etc)<br/><br/>Loot, on the other hand, I have no ideas about. I'd probably have to present it straight to the players to figure that one out.

I've used a few ideas from the thread. Hopefully I'll get to play this over the weekend.<br/><br/>//GHOST WORLD isn\u2019t one world, it\u2019s any one of an infinite number of parallel realities that lies beyond the Veil of this world, each quite similar yet different in noticeably significant ways. In recent years the Veil has thinned, tolerating some people to step through from this world to another. They are known as Ghosts, as they are mere shadows of their actual selves once they cross that threshold; spectral beings rarely seen by the general populace.<br/>     In this is the danger, for when a Ghost walks the other worlds he runs the risk of being noticed by the residents of that reality. No one\u2019s quite sure the reason for it, but the residents aren\u2019t friendly toward Ghosts. They generally react with violence. <br/><br/>//GHOST FIELD. Since the beginning of the Veil\u2019s thinning, tendrils of shroudstuff have permeated all the worlds. This field of energy allows those with the talent to exhibit great powers through the manipulation of the divergent physics of other realities.<br/><br/>//ECHOES are the ties that connect all worlds, all times, and all things. From one world to the next, from past to present to future, everything \u2013man, animal, even data \u2013 can be traced through these hidden strands.<br/><br/>//WRAITHS dwell between the worlds, hidden within the Veil. For centuries these creatures were unaware of the worlds of man, but now, through the thinning Veil Wraiths have discovered us. More notably, they have discovered Echoes. Echoes have become like a drug to these apparitions and, if they\u2019ve heard an Echo, they will stop at nothing to track down its source. Once they\u2019ve found the source they\u2019ll feed on the spirit of the unlucky individual, some viciously (.dog), others surreptitiously (.spider).<br/>     When a Wraith crosses over into a reality it\u2019s perceived as a ghostly creature. The longer it stays in that reality, the more Echo it absorbs, and the more physical it becomes.<br/><br/>/CREW/CREATION<br/>.You choose a Crewtype.<br/>.You pick CommonTrait.

The format and presentation is very neat--designed to be useable in play as opposed to something you can read easily before playing.<br/><br/>The mechanic, of course, is straight from Vincent, and works really well. I've played with it many times, and it always delivers. Those concerned about the vague nature of the Dangers shouldn't be worried--they feel real enough in play. <br/><br/>Keep in mind that "narrative" injuries open up the door for future bad things. For instance, you might have a danger like "you get drunk", which doesn't seem terribly dangerous or anything--you might think it has no impact. But then, in the next scene, another player might say, as a danger, "you lose control and punch her!" That wouldn't have been terribly plausible under normal circumstances... but now that you're drunk, it makes sense that would be a danger.<br/><br/>I use this mechanic in my game Land of Nodd, except that a) it's always other players who name dangers for your character, and b) I have combined it with the Pool mechanic, so that a player can decide how many dice to gamble on any given roll.

Like "Okay, where does Breaker usually live? The Watchtower? Okay, you, tell me about the Watchtower." Or one of the players asked "Can we use our supernatural abilities outside the ghost/world?" and I returned with "I don't know, can you?" and one of the other players said "I think so" and another player suggested that maybe they're not quite as powerful. So it wasn't a very formal process, and there was still a lot of looking to me as a source of setting authority, but I tried to delegate it a good deal when I could.<br/><br/>It was pretty action-heavy, mostly. As Brand said, "no respecters of character", players were a bit too busy <i>surviving</i> once the dice got rolling with Wraiths flying everywhere and security bursting onto the scene and gunfire and explosions and, at one point, yes, a dildo spinning through the air in bullettime ("You left the danger unresolved, so unintended harm is still potentially imminent.") to worry about emotional development or things like that. Although it occurs to me I could have had dangers like "You're horrified at what you've done" rather than "You're out of ammo", but that wasn't really the game I was going for at that point.<br/><br/>But the main plot was "Oh shit, Ambush!" followed by finding Breaker (the guy who had set up the ambush), followed by a pretty epic battle in the Watchtower (one of the characters ended up activating a Wraith Beacon without knowing what it was, so I pretty much just introduced the danger "More wraiths show up" to every one of their actions until they got rid of it, which was fun for a few minutes even if it killed a couple of Characters and probably doomed the Watchtower's status as clean and safe residential living area) followed by hunting down their treacherous former comrade Demon.<br/><br/>We had 5 players at the table, including myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198721/#Comment_198721" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-25T10:17:13+00:00" title="March 25, 2009 10:17AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2009 10:18AM by John_Harper.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, thanks for the detailed breakdown, Ben.

Some of the ones my players brought down on themselves (rather than ones I foisted on them):<br/><br/>"The vision sucks <i>everyone</i> in." (Vixen managed to really bomb this roll, so not only did this come to pass, but it wasn't even the right vision: All the characters got to experience an echo of the infamous Paper Tax Riots on Bell Street Bridge, rather than finding out why Breaker hadn't made it to their arranged meeting, and a large pack of Wraiths had.)<br/><br/>"I die as I lived." (This danger set by Grip's player, after he had been hurt, standing between hostile Watchtower Security and a couple of hungry Wraiths, holding only a dildo. I think the player wanted it to come to pass as the perfect ending, really.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199004/#Comment_199004" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-26T20:42:43+00:00" title="March 26, 2009  8:42PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike (veritascitor) and our crew just played it.

It involved a crew getting stranded in the ghost world when their ship (in our world, travel between the real world and ghost world is accomplished via Matrix-style hovercraft) is attacked by wraiths, and trying to make it on foot to find another ship they saw in the area.  We almost made it out alive, too, except our sweet-talker rolled triple ones when trying to convince the pilot of the other ship to risk a landing to extract us.

A bit of background: the son and mom and siblings had moved back east last fall.  Son had been born and raised in Oregon.  The original plan was for him to stay here in Eugene with Kyle, but at the last minute, he changed his mind and moved with the rest of the family.  (Kyle and the mom were never married, BTW, but stayed in touch to raise the boy together, and Kyle's made a lot of sacrifices to do just that.)  So Kyle and son were came to dinner a couple of days before the trip ended.  We hung out, played some Monty Python Fluxx, and then I suggested Ghost/Echo as a roleplaying pickup.  Kyle said he and son had never RP'd together before.  Kyle's a member of my gaming group and has a long history playing DnD.  The son used to be an avid Magic player.<br/><br/>So I pulled out G/E and sketchily described the premise, using the default assumption of Matrix-meets-Ghostbusters.  We decided /CREW meant character classes.  Kyle made a .Grip, whom he described as Indiana Jones with a shotgun and the handle of .Jazzman.  The son chose a .Demon, described as a homeless guy with an oversized trench.  His handle was .Section8.  We decided .Grip meant a weapons specialist, and that .Jazzman would get an extra die in armed combat.  .Demons were occult specialists, so .Section8 would get a bonus die when channeling the Ghost Field.  I narrated the opening scene of them in the Ghost World, and away we went.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199317/#Comment_199317" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-29T12:10:00+00:00" title="March 29, 2009 12:10PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Part Two:  Into the Game</b><br/><i>You're in a cramped apartment, paint peeling off the walls.  A spill of orange light pools on the floor through the solitary window.  Outside looms the spires and shadows of a dark, alien city.  You're here in the Ghost World looking for loot.</i><br/><br/>Each of them did a little freeform narration, describing what they found.  The son pulled up a black coat and felt something in the pockets.  Kyle opened a drawer and found a sheaf of banknotes  with runic denominations and shifting, groteque watermarks.  That's when I sprung the wraith ambush.<br/><br/><i>When .Jazzman looks up, the mirror over the dresser mists over, then reveals a face.  It's .White, an acquaintance.  A single word seeps from his lips and stains the mirror like blood: <b>Run.</b>  From the corners of the room pours a host of spiders, skittering along the walls with a nightweave of webs trailing behind them as they streak across the window, each dark strand a knife's slice through the outside light.  A few stream across the door, drawing their webs taut.</i><br/><br/>Here's where we pulled out the dice.  Kyle declared his goal as grabbing son and exiting through the door.  We encountered a little difficulty defining danger--all this was new to us, and it was all improv.  I set the immediate danger as the wraiths sealing the room and cutting off escape.  Son's goal was to hold onto his coat, so I set the danger as the wraiths doing him Harm.  The trick for me was to decouple the danger's outcome from goal failure since both states could occur.<br/><br/>They rolled and both succeeded without dangers instantiating.  They fled down a crooked hallway into an ornate elevator cage of wrought iron, in which they descended to the basement.<br/><br/><i>It's hot.  Really hot.  And dark.  You can't see the walls, just piles of what looks like coal.  An angry red light flickers from a square opening a stone's toss ahead of you.  A hulking shadow jams a massive shovel into the coal and spades a heap of it into the square, which responds with a crackling growl.  He turns, revealing craggy features and hollow eyes that mirror the furnace fire.  A deep-grooved sigil marks his forehead.  His overalls are stained black with soot.  "No trespassers," he grates in a voice that echoes the flames.</i><br/><br/>Some diceless RP followed as .Jazzman and .Section8 tried to cajole information from the truculent stoker.  .Section8 decided to use the Ghost Field to open a doorway out of there back into the "real world," specifically the canals.  The danger was that the Wraiths would appear.  They achieved the goal but also suffered partial appearance of the danger.  They narrated the portal opening, and their flight through it just as packs of black dogs boiled out from between the coal piles.  Two dogs followed them through.<br/><br/><i>You emerge onto a flat concrete culvert maybe fifty feet in diameter.  There's a thread of water under your feet, making a sluggish trickle over the cracks.  Behind you in the distance rise the towers of downtown Los Angeles, lit by massive spotlights.  The running lights of an aerial shuttle curve around the top of one of the buildings.  Before you, two massive dogs bristle and leap.  They're so pitch dark as to be without texture, as if cut from living shadow.</i><br/><br/>Combat ensued, obviously.  The dangers were Harm to each player.  .Jazzman's goal was to blow away the dog leaping at .Section 8.    .Section8's goal was to use the Ghost Field to banish both wraiths.  I added the danger to .Jazzman that additional harm would come to .Section8, and the additional danger to .Section8 that more wraiths would show up.  Both characters got bonus dice.<br/><br/>After the roll, they fiddled with the dice awhile, debating how to allocate them among goals and dangers.  Next time I'm going to have index cards for dangers and maybe a separate sheet with space marked for Goals and Dangers, along with the tables for reference.  Keeping dangers and goals clear proved a little trickier than expected, but some brisk note-taking cured that issue.  Eventually, .Section8 succeeded, but suffered a little harm.  .Jazzman succeeded entirely.<br/><br/>Something extra cool happened in this scene.  .Section8 decided he found a couple of things in the pocket of the coat he'd dragged with him from the Ghost World.  One was a harmonica.  The other he let me decide, so I picked a thumb-sized garnet carved in the shape of a human skull (as a counterpoint to the harmonica).  He narrated using the garnet in the banishing, and I let him roll an additional die.  We fed off each other, layering on details to describe him pulling the garnet from the pocket and channeling the Ghost Field to produce an explosion of ruby light that shredded the wraiths into scraps of shadow that fell to ashes on the cracked surface of the canal.<br/><br/>.Jazzman narrated breaking open the shotgun and inserting a couple of rounds, then clacking it shut and blowing away the wraith that was mauling his companion.  The player smiled and commented on how unlikely it was that he didn't hit .Section8 with any buckshot.  I said, "Yeah, but .Grips are <i>just that good."</i><br/><br/>.Section8's player described finding rusting ladder rungs built into the side of the canal, and he went up them, followed by .Jazzman.  It was starting to run late, so I had them run into a stereotypical feral gang camped on the canal bank.  More combat followed.  A couple of exchanges ended with both players having rolled disastrously, so we faded to black as the gang members approached with chains in hand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199318/#Comment_199318" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-29T12:11:42+00:00" title="March 29, 2009 12:11PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2009 12:46PM by Hexabolic.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Part Three: Post-mortem</b><br/>Overall, it was a helluva lot of fun.  That said, we were a bit hampered by uncertainty about the rules of the setting.  Had we not been totally running this off-the-cuff, we'd have avoided this.  In retrospect, I'd probably settle on something more clear about the Ghost World and the nature of the real world.  The play aids would have helped with the die rolling.  Still, we had a lot of fun, and the startup time took no more than a few minutes.  I gifted Kyle's son with the G/E printout, which I'd slipped into a plastic page sleeve as a double-sided game reference.<br/><br/>Here's a really neat note on which to end this AP: A few days later, after son returned to Missouri, he sat down with his mom and announced his desire to move back to Eugene and attend high school here.  Kyle, who is overjoyed by the development, said our G/E game was the first time his son had roleplayed, much less roleplayed with his father, and seemed to think it played a part (albeit minor) in the son's decision.  He called to thank me for a capstone father-son bonding experience.<br/><br/>It's a neat implementation, John.  Thanks for putting it out.  I look forward to see your one-page on play advice, and I too am moved to tinker with my own variants.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199324/#Comment_199324" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-29T13:13:02+00:00" title="March 29, 2009  1:13PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hexabolic</cite>The son chose a .Demon, described as a homeless guy with an oversized trench.

Five major groups are engaged in a kind of post-limited-nuclear-exchange cold war, and Belltown is the closest thing to an independent, neutral ground.  Belltown has a little in common with London, but more importantly it's the site where an archaeological team discovered the Old Ones' means of entering the Ghost World.  Next thing you know it's the site of "Grand Central" where every ghost ship goes to get transported into the Ghost World.<br/><br/>Now all the Cold War players are trying to make a way to get into the Ghost World themselves, and port back to somewhere to Grand Central.  With that kind of tactical advantage they'd be unstoppable.<br/><br/>That's the big impetus for going, despite the Wraiths - inscrutable constructs that swarm all over the Ghost World.  The Old Ones are gone, but some think that other temples like the one found at Grand Central may lead to even stranger worlds...<br/> <br/>Most obvious influences: The Matrix (GHOST ships), Blade Runner (very large military/industrial compounds, multi-directional espionage, no good guys), Stargate (the means to enter the Ghost World).<br/><br/>The game will center around a group of characters who work on the GHOST/ECHO<br/><br/>.DEMON is my guy, he's a legitimately angsty, rebellious 17-year-old.  He can manipulate the ghost field (telekinesis), and he's damn fast.  He was raised in a massive compound (called Cathedral Hill, actually a 10-story-high pentagon-like fortress) by the Teachers of Transcendental Light, which is one of the 5 factions.  The Teachers are also the major drug pushers of the setting, especially Starlight, which is a capsule that you crack and it flares before you inhale the fume and swallow the pill.  To save him from addiction to Starlight, .DEMON's sister took his drugs for him, and after she OD'd he escaped from the Teachers.  <br/><br/>And I haven't even started on the 5 factions.  I've got a feeling that the game will center as much on the power groups fighting over Belltown (Over the Edge style) as it will on events in the Ghost World itself. <br/><br/>Naturally, I can't wait for Thursday Night.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199376/#Comment_199376" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-29T17:49:18+00:00" title="March 29, 2009  5:49PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>I've got a feeling that the game will center as much on the power groups fighting over Belltown (Over the Edge style) as it will on events in the Ghost World itself.</blockquote>\nAgreed.  With all the interesting stuff that we came up with, I'm much more interested in toying with the social dynamics in Belltown.  After all, our Ghost World is essentially dead (at least, that we know), whereas our Belltown is teaming with life and conflicts just waiting to be explored.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199380/#Comment_199380" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-29T18:34:10+00:00" title="March 29, 2009  6:34PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

That is, if I can puzzle out Ryan's handwritten notes and my own memories. :P<br/><br/>The first of the five major factions is one that Ryan already mentioned:  The Teachers of the Transcendental Light.  They're a religious group that seem to be pushing some sort of "Truth".  The key factor is that their Teachers are both addicted to, and pushers of, the Starlight drug.  Are they worshippers of the Old Ones, Ryan?  That would make sense.  Their centre of operations is the Cathedral Hill complex.<br/><br/>The Pact Confederacy is what you would get if the you were to turn the United States into a militarist, fascist state.  Think post-9/11 patriotism and paranoia taken to the nth degree.  Their government espouses freedom, while monitoring their citizens' every move.<br/><br/>Inevit is another fascist state, but more in the fashion of North Korea.  This is a dictatorship that solely supports the dictator, and stresses structure as the key to a well-maintained society.  Militaristic, with rigid social hierarchies.<br/><br/>The Circle is wealthy, capitalist society.  Based initially on a few small islands, the Circle annexed more and more territory, until they became a major player in world politics.  They spread not through military conquest, but economic means.  To outsiders, they present a very tempting image: their diplomats throw extravagant, hedonistic parties, and (on TV, at least) their cities look to be the epitome of clean, safe, and high-tech.  Whether or not things are quite so bright and shiny for its citizens is a matter of much debate.<br/><br/>Lastly, we have the ironically-named Human Accord, a transhumanist society that pushes cybernetics and genetic modification as the next step for humanity.  While other societies toy with modifications, citizens of the Human Accord are not beyond replacing their entire bodies with cybernetic constructs.  They do their best to bring more converts into the fold, and don't willingly let anyone leave.  Belltown is a haven for HA ex-pats, and you'll also come across HA operatives who are trying to recover their "lost friends".<br/><br/>Belltown itself is an independent nation-state, formerly a protectorate of the now "slightly-irradiated" Meridian.  It remains independent due to the tensions between the other factions; if any one were to move to control Belltown (and thus the Ghost World entrance), then the others would be forced to act against them.  Most of the places on the list are probably in Belltown.  In particular, Cathedral Hill and Grand Central.  We also established that the Night Carnival was a sort of red-light district, where one can acquire any sort of holoporn, prostitute, or narcotic.  I believe our Vixen is going to be moonlighting as a Night Carnival operator when he's not raiding the ghost world.<br/><br/>As for the Old Ones I've mentioned, what we're doing in our sessions here is that we're toying with a bunch of different games, and we're connecting the storyline in each game with a common thread.  Our GHOST/ECHO game is set in the same world as the short In a Wicked Age game we just finished playing, only some tens of thousands of years in the future.  The Old Ones were a concept in the IaWA game, a dying society of super-powered humans whom we never interacted with directly (though at one point we might very well play game where we play Old Ones).<br/><br/>Suffice it to say, this is some fairly detailed stuff.  The fact that we came up with all this in only an hour or two just from looking at this one sheet speaks volumes about the GHOST/ECHO approach, John.  We love what you've done, and I for one would love to see more like it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malthusian" title="Malthusian"><img alt="Malthusian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malthusian">Malthusian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199386/#Comment_199386" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-29T19:43:10+00:00" title="March 29, 2009  7:43PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking about making the Oracle aspects of the game more prevalent, possibly creating full lists (13 entries, after IaWA) for /Others (Hearts), /Places (Clubs), /Loot (Diamonds), a fourth, possibly /Incident (Spades). I'd also add a separate Oracle list for /Ghost World that isn't defined by suit, only face. My thought is to add another die category, something along the lines of:<br/><br/>Die Roll     Action<br/>1               Draw a card for any Oracle, excepting /Ghost World (player's choice)<br/>2-3            Draw a card for /Others and /Places<br/>4-5            Draw a card for /Loot and /Incident<br/>6               Draw a card for /Ghost World<br/><br/>My thinking behind this is simply to create an extra incentive to develop the story/game world. Whatever Oracle is drawn must be narrated into the current scene/next scene(?).<br/><br/>Of course, to do this I'd need to create a fuller Oracle.<br/><br/>Is this a good idea? Bad Idea?

I've had vague notions along those lines too. The kind of short, concise style in which John presents Ghost/Echo, and the way he's structured the info, goes extremely well with that setting and probably anything else with a modern or futuristic touch. It'd be a big contrast against a wooly fantasy game of wizard leprechauns though. If you're gonna manage to take up that little space and still give people enough to work with themselves, it be best to take any chance to convey the setting's feel/gist/essence - of course including how it's presented.<br/><br/>I might totally be stating the obvious here but it's something I've become kind of intrigued by just this last year and still have thirst for exploring and talking about - hence my fascination for this ingenious format.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199809/#Comment_199809" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T16:52:18+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  4:52PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 31, 2009 4:53PM by C_Edwards.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been inspired to work up some oracles of my own.

Here you find short and clearly subjetive accounts of this foreign land, complete with a list of facts (maybe local customs etc.) that can be used when appropriate or if the players run out of other ideas. Now, the whole point of this is that we don't know which of these facts are true, we only know once we preform the traditional greeting for example. I've been thinking that you roll for these as usual - the goal might be "perform the peace dance" but if you fail, well it wasn't a peace dance was it? The tricky part I guess is setting good dangers related to these things since you definitely can get in trouble even if you perform the dance correctly or not get in trouble even though the formal greeting turned out to be a hideous insult.<br><br>A variation of this popped up yesterday.

The "fill in the blanks" style ended up much more entertaining than I'd have expected!  Some highlights:<br/><br/>.PAPER was indeed literally paper, but laced with a Ghost World drug that people with the ability to cross into the Ghost World (the /CREW, natch) needed to survive. /LOOT it, smoke it, live a little longer.<br/>.METAL was the material .WRAITHS, monstrous guardians of the Ghost World, were made of.<br/>.STONES were batteries of power needed for the most impressive feats of Ghost World manipulation.<br/><br/>At one point, the /CREW needed to decide who would risk life and limb to win some .STONES at .THE NIGHT CARNIVAL. They did so by playing rock-scissors-paper, except that of course it was .STONE/.METAL/.PAPER...<br/><br/>Early on, "sucked into the void" was a custom DANGER the GM added to a die roll to cross back to the normal world, representing the malign influence of an inky black sphere at the top of .THE WATCHTOWER. It got a "neutral" die assigned to it, meaning the danger remained. Later this was added to another die roll, came true, and thus opened a permanent doorway between the normal world and the Ghost World. Shutting it back down became the adventure hook for the rest of the game!<br/><br/>Clever stuff, John.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am a late comer to this thread, as I don't hang around on story-games too much. I have to say, though, that I love this one-sheet game setup. I find that, for me, there is plenty here with which to play a one shot.<br/><br/>I plan to start my players in media res and have the game be a slow reveal. I will start with an action scene ... the wraith attack described in the two-sentence setup. (Paraphrased: You were looting and were sold out. Wraiths attack.) The pacing mechanic will be me asking revealing questions of the players. I'll use a chip economy to move the questions around so everyone gets to decide some things about the world. (Each player gets a fixed number of chips to spend, and they have to spend a chip to answer a question. That way they can all answer the same amount, but can go when inspired.) A good starting question might be "You are trying to get out of the ghost world but something is preventing your exit. What?"  Once the players get through the wraith attack, they can work to undo the condition that is preventing their escape. <br/><br/>While doing this, they can discover their powers (a question they can essentially answer at any time), flashback to why they were looting in the first place, etc. Hopefully I can introduce each question by linking it to the environment. The flashback question, for instance, might go like "You stop to catch your breath and see your own face in a puddle of water on the street. Your eyes look haunted as they remember how you go into this mess. Tell me about it." (Okay, that's not technically a question, but you get the idea.)<br/><br/>As a GM my goal will be to push it enough that each character gets damaged or has to sell out on goals to some extent. Ideally, I would like to see a player or two die and/or make a big sacrifice. When each player has a chip or less to spend I'll know end game is coming up and can push for closure.<br/><br/>All this requires a pretty creative group. Luckily I game with some kick ass players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210092/#Comment_210092" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T18:10:23+00:00" title="June  2, 2009  6:10PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds good, Troy.

RR was definitely not my intention. Do you see this as possibly GM-less? I guess my first instinct was to imagine myself running the game and bringing enough adversity to the table that players had to either be very, very good or they had to be willing to tear themselves up a bit to survive or help others survive. I am thinking about two things now. One of them is the odds. As you say, the system is likely to chew people up pretty good without any pushing.

It is a surprisingly fun mechanic to mess with as a solitaire exercise, either to test an encounter/scenario or just to exercise the imagination. I am, however, having trouble keeping goals and dangers on separate continuum. This is especially true in Suffer Harm. Here is an example sequence of events.<br/><br/>I sneak into the Railyard to dig up some stones I detected there. I get the stones (5), but I am detected (2).<br/>I run and vipers descend on me. Acting under pressure I manage to escape (6), but suffer harm (1).<br/>[This is where it goes wonky for me.]<br/>I roll to endure the pain and keep running. The possible outcomes are:<br/><br/>     Succeed-Succeed. I fight off the pain and keep running. I am not incapacitated.<br/>     Fail-Succeed. I don't fight off the pain and must walk, crawl, or just stop and pant. But I am not incapacitated.<br/>     Succeed-Fail. I fight off the pain and keep running. BUT, I am incapacitated?<br/>     Fail-Fail. I don't fight off the pain and I must stop. I am incapacitated, I black out.<br/><br/>The goal and the danger are too closely aligned, so the "like" results (succeed x 2 or fail x 2) seem redundant while the mixed results seem a little or a lot oxymoronic.<br/><br/>Help?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210194/#Comment_210194" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T11:47:52+00:00" title="June  3, 2009 11:47AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool. I love game questions!<br/><br/>First, you decide when you roll to endure harm. It can be immediately or much later, depending on how you want to handle it. I like to be really specific about the harm (your leg is broken) and that informs when we roll to endure it (I run on my broken leg!).<br/><br/>Now, about mixed results. Mixed results are part of what make G/E an "oracle game" in my mind. They give you a result to interpret in the context of the fiction. Sometimes a result might seem incongruous at first glance, but that's okay. Apply one or more of these principles:<br/><br/>1. It doesn't all have to happen instantly. If you get incapacitated, for example, that can manifest at a future point if need be. Think of the result as "hovering" nearby, waiting for the right moment to drop in to the fiction.<br/>2. The result doesn't have to depend only on what is currently present in the fiction. If you need to introduce new elements to account for a result, that's usually a good thing. It builds the world.<br/>3. Borrow! If you really can't think of a way to incorporate a result from one action type or danger, grab a result from another action type instead. "'Incapacitated' doesn't make sense to me here. How about 'you're put in a bad position' instead?"<br/>4. Be very specific about the fictional actions and consequences. This is good general play advice. It's not "harm" it's "two bullet wounds to your right arm." It's not "a bad position" it's "four Wraiths have you cornered in the Tower." The specific details will better help paint a picture for how to apply the results to the situation.<br/><br/>So, for your example:<br/><br/>Fail-Succeed: You're not incapacitated, but you can't keep running. You have to hole up where you are rather than making it to your destination. You can still do stuff wherever you are though, since you're not incapacitated. Like call in for pickup or help or whatever.<br/><br/>Succeed-Fail: You fight off the pain and keep running. You make it to your preferred destination. But then you collapse. The strain was just too much.<br/><br/>Does that help?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/docholaday" title="docholaday"><img alt="docholaday" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/docholaday">docholaday</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210226/#Comment_210226" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T13:37:48+00:00" title="June  3, 2009  1:37PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2009 10:18PM by docholaday.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent.

There are enough here to run it at a Con or something. You could even double up on them in the same group, there's enough blank on each sheet that one could make distinct characters. Hell, you could run a whole crew with the same prompt, making them all Magicians or Lovers, or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've just noticed there are some minor grammatical mistakes in some of the //BIO, so forgive me for that. And the occasional genre reference in them.<br/>\n<br/>\nA note on the //CURRENCY section: I'm probably going to working that into something analogous to the typical Stat block most games have, except its more a measure of your wealth. _EFT is like networked social capital - think Facebook meets Wall Street. I think I stole the idea from Cory Doctorow's <u>Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom.</u> _PHARMA is the amount of drugs, typically hard to make/illegal drugs, you have on you and can be used to barter with or traded as commodities. _MASS I was thinking would be like exotic but stable types of matter/ectoplasm/essence/alchemical goodies, that can be used to buy/sell/&amp;c.; Additionally, I figured they'd all be rated one through six so that the player could roll against them to see if they could use they wealth to their advantage or something. Maybe burn them for some special effect. I don't know really.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can email the original .pfds to anyone who wants them. They're Letter-sized. Again, just let me know. Oh, and the Template I made in Adobe Illustrator if you what to come up with some of your own in the same vein.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I'm probably going to be making some more up tomorrow; working my way through the rest of the Major Arcana.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnough preamble, here are the rest:<br/>\n<img alt="e7ib6e.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://i40.tinypic.com/e7ib6e.jpg"/><br/>\n<img alt="2i7x1rm.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://i39.tinypic.com/2i7x1rm.jpg"/><br/>\n<img alt="29c555i.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://i42.tinypic.com/29c555i.jpg"/><br/>\n<img alt="2a5nbwi.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://i44.tinypic.com/2a5nbwi.jpg"/><br/>\n<img alt="jq2vib.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://i40.tinypic.com/jq2vib.jpg"/><br/>\n<img alt="2eok4fn.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://i40.tinypic.com/2eok4fn.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214152/#Comment_214152" name="Item_161" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-24T05:03:00+00:00" title="June 24, 2009  5:03AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!<br>Should DISGNATION be DESIGNATION?                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214200/#Comment_214200" name="Item_162" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-24T11:24:50+00:00" title="June 24, 2009 11:24AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, it should.

The night\u2019s events played over and over in his head. Everything had happened so quickly he was sure it had been a set-up. One minute he and his crew were crouched beneath Chalk Street Bridge preparing to infiltrate Neon Cathedral. The next, chaos and confusion.<br><br>The Veil had gaped before them. Breaker\u2019s crew burst forth from across the gap and opened fire. Grip\u2019s crew was unprepared, pinned down against the walls of the bridge. Hull was out front and took a psyche-slug straight to her third eye. Fortunately Coil had had the foresight to append an Echo to each of them. With a word the Echoes reverberated, twisting the crew inward and sending them away with a pop. Grip reconstructed in the alley, his Ectoskeleton wrecked. Coil lay nearby, his body exhausted from the Echo manipulation. There was no way to know which way Demon and Vixen had gone. They\u2019d have to fend for themselves.<br><br>And now here he was lost in Ghost World, an easy target while his Ectoskeleton was out of commission. Here he\u2019d be visible to every Wraith that swam in the Ghost Field. And it would only be a matter of time before Breaker and his crew came gunning for him. But Grip still had a few tricks up his sleeves. He took several calming breaths, reached into the Veil and pulled free a slip of Aether. He draped the gossamer cloak over both himself and Coil. The cloak wouldn\u2019t dim their presence for long - it would dissipate within the hour - but there should be enough time for the Ectoskeleton to repair itself.

It is better to change this: if rolling for danger, higher means more "danger". Getting a 5 or 6 when rolling for danger means real trouble.<br/>\n(comment: this is a matter of taste)<br/>\n4. The goal/danger system is  asking a lot of player-creativity , it is annoying to have to state a danger for each goal, that slows down play. In the games I know, the GM tells the player all about the dangers.<br/>\n(comment: this is a typical old-school conditioning)<br/>\n5. there was some lack of "supernatural elements"<br/>\n(comment: this scenario was meant as a foreshadowing of the Shadowrun era, the supernatural still has to intrude into the world, but it was possible to Listen for Echo's of the supernatural)<br/>\n6.

I hope these don't seem stupid, but I'm a bit unfamiliar with this style of game.  First question is this: when the players want their characters to detect or perceive something that might be hidden, which of the moves are they supposed to role for?  For example, the crew survives the initial ambush and learn that Breaker sold them out.  They decide to 'find' him; going to his home.  They get to the door, but they're worried it might be booby-trapped, since Breaker is a paranoid type.  What roll do they make to see if they find the traps?  Here's another example.  Breaker hears them coming through the door and escapes out the window and down the fire escape.  Some of the crew follow him.  He sees them coming after him and flees down a dark and winding alley.  The crew follow, chasing on foot; but they're worried that this is another ambush and they want search the shadows for more of Breaker's goons, as they run down Breaker.  What move now?  I could sort of see it being <i>hold steadfast</i> in the first example because of the concentration implied in searching thoroughly, and <i>acting under pressure</i> in the second because of the haste, but I may be reaching here...<br/><br/>Second question: The characters continue their pursuit.  Breaker turns around and fires shots at the characters.  Do the players roll for <i>acting under pressure</i> to avoid being hit by the bullets?  Or does the GM roll for Breaker <i>committing to violence</i>?  I kind of thought from my reading of the rules that only the players roll dice based on the fiction that is being created between them and the GM--that the GM doesn't roll any dice.<br/><br/>Third question:  if two players want their characters to <i>commit to violence</i> against each other, what happens?  Does the first player who commits roll the dice and the second player give the danger, or do they both roll?<br/><br/>Thanks<br/><br/>-Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438043/#Comment_438043" name="Item_195" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-02T02:17:28+00:00" title="September  2, 2014  2:17AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please help!

So I printed this out and played a game on the train ride into the city today. In a hour I ran a complete adventure and it was great fun. Honestly I haven't tried to run a game like this before so it took a bit of mental stretching to run this. It kind of reminded me of Apocalypse world in that it creates a world jointly with the player. <br/><br/>My Daughter 11, came up with the idea that the ghosts of the ghost world are not afraid of death and can be found running around the city jumping from roofs, climbing and otherwise running amok. As she said just because they are dead doesn't stop them from living. So my ideas of a dark world of mournful ghosts and echoes was instantly broken in a good way. <br/><br/>After the game I rezed I really appreciated the lack of detail. It means I can play this game with lots of different people and have completely different takes on the crew and world.<br/><br/>The only change I made was to limit the crew to being good at one thing. <br/><br/>The only other change I might make is to change the names on the wraiths so they are like the crew in that they suggest but don't directly say what they are. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438615/#Comment_438615" name="Item_198" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-22T17:16:58+00:00" title="September 22, 2014  5:16PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, I missed these questions!<br/><br/>1. For perception-type stuff, I almost always call for <i>act under pressure</i>, with the danger being a variety of possible things (running out time, alerting the enemy, drawing the wrong conclusion). If there's no pressure, then there's no "perception check"; just tell them.<br/><br/>2. Only the players roll. Don't roll for dodging bullets. Tell them what the NPCs are going to accomplish (he takes aim to shoot you with his shotgun) and ask the player what they try to do. The danger will be the NPC accomplishing their move.<br/><br/>3. Either way works. Sometimes one player rolling is best, other times, they'll both want to roll. That's fine, too. Just talk it out until the rolls and dangers are figured out, then all the outcomes will make sense. ("My danger comes true, but you failed at your action... so I guess you don't shoot me in the chest... maybe you clip my arm.")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438617/#Comment_438617" name="Item_199" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-22T21:59:20+00:00" title="September 22, 2014  9:59PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the answers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8706/ghost-echo-oracle-game-experiment-and-pdf/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8706/ghost-echo-oracle-game-experiment-and-pdf">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8706/ghost-echo-oracle-game-experiment-and-pdf/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8706/ghost-echo-oracle-game-experiment-and-pdf/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8706/ghost-echo-oracle-game-experiment-and-pdf/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F8706%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F8706%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
