Obviously ratings for a whole system or product line are as problematic as ratings for a single product - the number doesn't tell you much other than how much people like it in general, but a review could be useful.<br/><br/>How would you set out to review something like GURPS 3rd Edition, for example? Not just the basic set, but the compendiums, tech books, world books and such? How about Burning Wheel Revised, which I think comes in at 5 books in the system?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313454/#Comment_313454" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-20T17:40:54+00:00" title="February 20, 2011  5:40PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At minimum, I'd think any such review would need to focus on if the product line does (or does not) realize the notion of "the sum is greater than the whole of its parts". And, importantly, <i>how</i> it does (or does not) do so. That is, rather than review a list of the products in the line, a product line review should really work at a higher level, in how the products enhance each other (or, you know, don't), how much of the line is necessary to play (i.e. the "buy-in"), etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313455/#Comment_313455" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-20T17:52:16+00:00" title="February 20, 2011  5:52PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does the product fulfill it's game play promises? <br/><br/>Take Ghost: the Spookening for example, it promises a game of spooky intrigue and haunted angsty teenagers. But say, splatbooks and all, is thirty weighty tomes of elaborate hex-combat. <br/><br/>I think games like GURPS and BW deliver on their promises. It might not be one's cup of tea but with GURPS you can have a game with a cyborg, an elf and a blue whale and they'll be mechanically compatible. Whereas with BW, it's a kinda crunchy fantasy game that puts characters beliefs front and center. <br/><br/>I suppose you could take it further by asking this question of the Character Burner, or something. Does it actually burn characters?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313465/#Comment_313465" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-20T19:36:53+00:00" title="February 20, 2011  7:36PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I were to try to seriously review a product line I would try to come up with a series of metrics.

It seems to me that the point of a review is to tell people what they're getting into or what they'll get out of it, and yeah, I'd give out of print games a lower score on accessibility and that's something that people could consider. Its like a good book on dog breeds... they tell you if the dog needs lots of space, but that's not necessarily a dis on the dog.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313482/#Comment_313482" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-21T00:12:13+00:00" title="February 21, 2011 12:12AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the thing though, I think people usually read reviews of games they're considering getting, and that means they have some access to it.<br/><br/>I see a collection of AD&amp;D 2e books on the shelf at a local gaming store, clearly it's accessible to me, and I've looked at the price and decided it's within my budget, now I just want to see if it's good. I don't need someone who expected a much higher price point telling me it's hard to find and too expensive for what you get.<br/><br/>Out of print in particular has a tendency of messing with price. Something could normally run $60 used because it's rare, but someone else could come along and offer it for $5, just because they're not playing it anymore.<br/><br/>You'd also have to think about different locations. Someone in South Africa will find any game hard to get ahold of, so rating something higher or lower based on accessability would seem pretty bizarre to the person who has to find someone to ship the books to him in any case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313507/#Comment_313507" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-21T08:53:21+00:00" title="February 21, 2011  8:53AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is something I've thought about a lot, another factor has to be that many different people may have worked on many different parts of the game over the course of many years.

You've got a massive difference in advice between the DMG published in 89 and the Campaign Sourcebook published in 90. The gameplay type in Ruins of Undermountain ends up quite different from what you find in Tales of Enchantment, despite both modules using the same system. <br/><br/>I suppose this is where, like a single product, it helps to have multiple reviews, so you get different opinions. Someone who likes the dungeon crawl with mapping out what you explore is going to have a quite different perspective on 2nd Ed from someone who likes political intrigue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
