He'd played the game I wrote called Ganakagok and thought that its combination of small-scale character interaction and big-picture consequentiality was exactly the sort of thing he was looking for in a game where the characters were colonists in a new world. He wanted a game that could mimic the experience described in Jared Diamond's book <i>Collapse</i> (the follow-up to his <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i>), of the Norse in Greenland failing to adapt to the local conditions and thus faltering and ultimately failing.<br/><br/>Of course, one of the problems with trying to develop a colony game is that the theme of colonization is fundamentally problematic. You don't have to be a post-colonial theorist to recognize that the displacement of indigenous people in America and elsewhere and the enslavement of Africans are historical evils intimately bound up with European colonialism, and to make a game in which the PCs were "colonists" in a straightforward way would be to make light of that. Changing the setting and making it a science fiction game of colonizing a new planet wouldn't necessarily solve the problem, since the intimation of allegory is hard to avoid (see, e.g., James Cameron's <i>Avatar</i>) and even the terraforming of a lifeless world raises similar issues, if you look closely enough (as Kim Stanley Robinson's <i>Mars</i> trilogy illustrates).<br/><br/>As I reflected on this, I remembered that tabletop role-playing relies for much of its force on the reincorporation of genre tropes (we are all bricoleurs), and it occurred to me that the solution to my problem was to regard the genre I was in as one of <i>historical fantasy</i> rather than <i>historical fiction</i>. Historical fantasy--within which I include time travel and alternate history sf as well as secret histories and some of what has been called the "New Weird"--is at its root about re-imagining the past rather than re-creating it, and it allows all kinds of "slipstream" tricks to be played.<br/><br/>I'm using "slipstream" in the sense that Bruce Sterling did back in 1989:\n<blockquote><cite><a href="http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/Bruce_Sterling/Catscan_columns/catscan.05" rel="nofollow">Bruce Sterling</a> says</cite>It seems to me that the heart of slipstream is an attitude of peculiar aggression against "reality." These are fantasies of a kind, but not fantasies which are "futuristic" or "beyond the fields we know." These books tend to sarcastically tear at the structure of "everyday life" . . . . Slipstream is also marked by a cavalier attitude toward "material" which is the polar opposite of the hard-SF writer's "respect for scientific fact." Frequently, historical figures are used in slipstream fiction in ways which outrageously violate the historical record. History, journalism, official statements, advertising copy . . . all of these are grist for the slipstream mill, and are disrespectfully treated not as "real-life facts" but as "stuff," raw material for collage work. Slipstream tends, not to "create" new worlds, but to *quote* them, chop them up out of context, and turn them against themselves.</blockquote>\nAfter a few false starts (apologies, Dreamation/Dexcon playtesters!), I think I've finally figured out the implications of that. "Oracular" meanings associated with a random card draw are assembled like a Burroughsian cut-up and used to prompt an imagined quasi-historical backdrop against which the actions of PCs are mysteriously consequential; play shuttles back and forth between in-character action and imagined historical significance. It's fun, and I think it's the game Simon wanted, three or four years ago now.

Creating the setting is a group exercise, done in play: A ship is sailing across the ocean, soon to arrive in a new world. Who are these Newcomers? (Draw oracular cards to prompt GM-facilitated collaborative brainstorming). And who is waiting on the shores of that New World? (Ditto for the Natives). The oracular motifs might suggest English pilgrims, Barbary pirates, Spanish conquistadors, Chinese treasure fleets, Iroquois widows, Moche craftsmen, or what have you. Any given group could set up a situation that hews fairly closely to the conventional ("Obviously, the newcomers are the colonists at Roanoke," someone might say) or that goes haring off wildly into speculative alternate history ("The natives are clearly the Mound Builders of the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, so they're native Americans except with cities and kings") or even outright fantasy ("So you've got steampunk pirates on the one hand and blood-magic Aztecs on the other, right?")  To this basic cultural dichotomy is added a third group, the "Outsiders," who are neither native nor newcomer and might be a third-party rival, an oppressed minority, or something else entirely ("The outsiders are the sasquatch who live in the mountains"). Each society has different game-mechanical attributes determined by the card draw as well.<br/><br/>Players then use oracular motifs in a manner like that in setting creation to inspire characters who may be Native, Newcomer, or Outsider, and who are also mechanically defined by card draw. More importantly, characters are qualitatively defined by their background, current circumstances, and ambition. So characters start the game in motion.<br/><br/>Playing it out is fairly straightforward role-play. The GM uses the oracle to introduce new situations and NPCs and give them game-mechanical oomph; the PCs state their intentions (which may be in pursuit of their ambitions, in reaction to current circumstances and emergencies, or in anticipation of future developments) and then conflicts are resolved with a card trick-taking mechanic. The suits of the cards that are played constrain the narration of in-game events associated with the conflict. Cards from taken tricks are then "scored" for game-mechanical and associated in-game consequences, including the relative power, prosperity, and freedom of the three cultures in the game.<br/><br/>There is no hard and fast rule that declares when to start ending the game--when does history end?--but at some point characters will have achieved or failed to achieve their ambitions, the map will have become cluttered, and it will be apparent that this chapter in the history of never-was is just about over. The distribution of the cultural attributes of the Natives, Newcomers, and Outsiders  achieved in play contributes to the historical legacy of each of the three cultures, and characters are either remembered or forgotten based on their success in achieving their ambitions. Players narrate the fates of the characters and their civilizations. The curtain falls, and the game is over.<br/><br/>That's a quick precis of the game; I'm happy to answer specific questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357800/#Comment_357800" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-04T16:56:25+00:00" title="February  4, 2012  4:56PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2012 4:58PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>Each society has different game-mechanical attributes determined by the card draw as well . . .

You can establish "greater freedom for the Natives" as an ambition that you are trying to achieve at some point during the game, and use the tricks that you take to work toward that goal, narrating in what that means when you succeed. Your description is constrained by the motifs of the oracle (i.e., a card draw). <br/><br/>In the long-term--from the perspective of history--it's trickier. But there's a way of self-consciously working to affect the historical legacy you leave behind. Each character is affiliated with a particular culture, and has access to that culture's resources, defined as Warfare (i.e., technology and organization), Life (i.e., population size and diversity), Abundance (i.e., economic resources and environmental quality) and Law (i.e., justice and freedom). As an Outsider, your achievement of Law-related goals contributes to the Outsider culture's historical legacy of justice. So you'd want to "go native" first, at least partially, affiliating your character with Native Law rather than Outsider Law.<br/><br/>However, it might be more important to make sure that whatever civilization comes to dominate the New World leaves a legacy of peace rather than of conquest.<br/><br/>That is, as a player you're just playing your character, reacting to the exigencies of life in the New World and striving to achieve your own personal ambition. While you're doing this, though, the GM is tracking the cards you score and using them as a measure of your culture's emphasis on war or peace, expansion or contraction, prosperity or poverty, and justice or privilege. The culture that scores the most in total becomes the more or less "dominant civilization" of the New World, and its distribution of scores across suits determines its historical legacy to the New World. The rules say, "The GM outlines the basic character of the legacies to the New World, and then allows players to elaborate, incorporating the individual legacies of their characters where possible, in order to provide an epilogue to the action of the game." This means, of course, that a sufficiently insistent player could attempt to shoehorn his or her particular vision of what should happen into the end-game narration, but that's a matter for table-level dynamics rather than rules, I think.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357839/#Comment_357839" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-05T01:13:11+00:00" title="February  5, 2012  1:13AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>I'll be at Dreamation.<br/><br/>I want in on a game.</blockquote>\nAwesome, Ralph.

Is that right?<br/><br/>That's essentially right. "What gets remembered" about the events of the game (in the fiction that those events constitute the raw material of a real history) is a specific output of conflict.\n<blockquote>Random thought: would you ever run this system on the micro level, where legacies are determined within a human lifespan, so you can continue to play your characters after the world has been changed by their actions, and then you change it again, and play again, and so on over multiple sessions?</blockquote>\nOh, I like that. There's room for that, I think. You could end one game and then begin the next where the last one left off, foregoing the normal bootstrapping of setting and characters in order to continue play in the setting. There are already rules for introducing new characters on the death of old ones, and so I suppose you could introduce a mechanism of some sort to make sure that characters don't live too long (for suspension of disbelief purposes, I mean). Each session would then amount to "The New World: The Next Generation."\n<blockquote>Can't make it to Dreamation, but I hope to see you at Nerdly!</blockquote>\nExcellent.
