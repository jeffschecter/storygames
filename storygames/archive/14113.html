In every case, we\u2019ve attempted not to draw attention to our technique, that is, those people who are highly attuned to what they perceive as political correctness do not notice, while still attaining non-sexist language. My preferred approach, using singular \u201cthey\u201d is therefore not acceptable, despite antecedents such as Shakespeare and Austen. Using the plural sometimes works, but can be tricky when you really want to have a singular person. You can also name individuals and then refer to their gender, though with players and characters and the GM, it becomes rather complex. Another approach is that the GM is female, the players, male, and the second person.<br/><br/>What techniques do you recommend which fulfil these criteria?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319535/#Comment_319535" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-08T05:12:14+00:00" title="April  8, 2011  5:12AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I write board game rules, I'll just try to be specific.

He was part of a group (men and women) that was designing a physics test for high school students. One of the questions involved a boy and a girl carrying a heavy metal object (basically a long pipe) and the point of the question was that one of them did more work than the other, based on how each carried the object. The committee fretted about how to set up this question. Do they show the girl doing less work (because it shows she is smart, knows physics, and is using it to her advantage)? Do they show the girl doing more work (because it shows she can outperform the boy physically)? They got into heated arguments about it.<br/><br/>Eventually, not able to reach a real resolution, they decided that they would just change the position of the boy and girl each year, so that, if anyone objected to the the girl doing more or less work, they could tell them of their dilemma and their compromise solution. He showed slides of the problem they eventually published.<br/><br/>According to the professor, they only ever got one complaint about the problem: an objection that they showed the girl walking behind the boy.<br/><br/>The lesson I took away from this was, perhaps, not the one the professor intended to convey when telling the story, because when he showed the slide of the problem, I was struck by something else: the problem itself sucked. It was horribly worded and a bit ambiguous.<br/><br/>The moral of the story is: spend your energy making your text legible and coherent. If you spend any time worrying about gender-based language, make it about how you can use gender to make your text more clear (as Daniel's "he and she to refer to two interacting players" does).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319544/#Comment_319544" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-08T07:04:46+00:00" title="April  8, 2011  7:04AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem with "You" is that it generally refers to the player or GM.

If you use it consistently, you're probably fine. <br/><br/>Game books are often best treated as reference books, especially the longer ones. As such, it's best if they are written in a way where you can take relatively small chunks out of the context of the text as a whole and understand them as completely as possible. That's also why organization and headings and such are so important.<br/><br/>As such, an explicit explanation of how you are using she for the GM and he for default player is going to be a difficult thing to put into an easily findable location. Sure, it will likely be at the front. But in a long RPG book, that's often the part where I'm skimming pretty lightly anyway, cause it's often taken up with fluffy lightweight stuff like "What is a roleplaying game?".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319698/#Comment_319698" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-08T14:02:49+00:00" title="April  8, 2011  2:02PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know this isn't what you're asking, but here's what the AP Stylebook says,\n<blockquote>Do not presume maleness in constructing a sentence, but use the pronoun <i>his</i> when an indefinite antecedent may be male or female.

It's what I'd use if I had a horse in this race. (In practice I seem to often use "he", but that's just because that's how I've been taught, and as a non-native I don't truly have any gut-level hang-ups about this, so I don't think about it most of the time.) Some people will complain, perhaps, but it's more important to be right than to be popular, it seems to me. Besides, the complaints are not based on any objective reasoning anyway, so it's just a matter of getting used to the logical usage over time. The more people use the gender-neutral option, the less it'll bother people. Women are not exactly going to go away, or at least I hope they won't, so English-users will basically have to spend the next eternity struggling with this, or they need to change their language to enable gender-neutral expression. Not even a choice in the long run if you ask me.<br/><br/>I discard the artificial constructs ranging from avoidance of third person singular to assigning arbitrary genders as unworthy of quality writing: write the truth and write for the ages, and resolve this issue in the language you are committed to. It's a losing strategy to try to write your way around the issue if that causes you to write in a difficult or hilariously artificial manner. Like, consider that practice of setting arbitrary genders to imaginary people who are place-holders of the generic reader/player whose gender is actually indefinite and irrelevant - how is that elegant and skillful writing? When faced with new needs that will persist over time, adapt the language - the coming generations will thank you for it.<br/><br/>In other words, I don't know that Simon's conundrum has an solution in the English language, so "they" remains the least bad of the imperfect solutions. It's actually almost acceptable even for the unnoticeability criterion, as many folks won't particularly notice it anymore. There is no solution that somebody won't notice, so the mere existence of people who'll complain can't be cause for dismissing the best solution.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Hallett</cite>It would be refreshing however to have someone deliberately highlight their use of "their" as a conscious choice and tell the pseuds to suck it up.

Also, use specific examples where it is clear what gender the person you are talking about is.  Its perfectly PC to say "He" when "He" refers to Jim, and to say "She" when she refers to Jill without being hokey, awkward, or non-grammatical.<br/><br/>The second, I advise avoiding framing not only this question but also the way you're thinking about this issue as "sexist vs. non-sexist"  <br/>For me I didn't use "you" in BRS as an attempt to avoid sexist language.  I'm totally not interested in jumping into that mess of "bigotry vs. political correctness" nonsense.  I did it because it makes rules texts much more personal and interesting to read...more engaging and less like a text book.  I wrote Universalis like a text book...I really like it (I also like reading text books) most did not.  Saying "you " is much more interesting to read than "the GM " AND has the added benefit of avoiding the whole He/She thing altogether.<br/><br/>So my advice is to write in a way that sounds like you the author are excited about what you're writing...cuz that's way better than trying to write in a way that seeks to avoid offense and winds up boring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320726/#Comment_320726" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T07:52:28+00:00" title="April 15, 2011  7:52AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @Valamir That's good advice. My intial objection to "You" was the complications surrounding the conflation of player and character. I've jumped that mental hurdle. In fiction, unless the text is addressed at a fictional character, I find writing in the second person intrusive, but for some reason that doesn't apply to game texts. Looking through the GUMSHOE text, Robin Laws uses the second person, conflating character and player quite often, with the occasional named player or character, and the very occasional "he or she".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
