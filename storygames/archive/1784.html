                    Paul Czege states actual play as his ultimate goal as a game designer and publisher. I share that goal, though Paul and I do have slightly different methods in terms of sales and business (they're not really that different). <br/><br/>Anyway, it got me thinking about actual play and the indie scene. Or, really, about RPGs in general.<br/><br/>How many books did you buy, say, this year? (I bought about 15 or so.) How many did you actually play? (I played exactly ZERO of those new games, more's the pity. My situation is not as good as others; wish I could play these games more so.)<br/><br/>Were those actually played games really designed for short or one-off games? Or, did you devote some time to them? (No and no.)<br/><br/>If you are a game designer, or have inklings to be, how many of the books that you bought did you buy because you consider them interesting or good design influences? (Yes.)<br/><br/>Does the number of games you own compared to the number of games you actually play bother you? (Yes, greatly.)<br/><br/>What keeps you from playing more games you wish to play? Is it a stubborn or reluctant group? Not enough time? (General disinterest among my play groups, limited time.)<br/><br/>My responses to these questions lead me to some troubling conclusions (troubling to ME at least -- this will not be universal). Specifically, I think there is way too much emphasis on new designs and way too little emphasis on playing exising designs, marketing existing designs, and supporting existing designs. We all get a hard on for the new cool thing, when in fact some of the "old" cool things haven't even been explored very much at all.<br/><br/>In short, I think the indie scene suffers from designers -- <i>myself included</i> -- who love design so much that they'd rather create and publish Yet Another Game than support the solid designs they already have. I certainly do this, to the detriment of my own games.<br/><br/>Some of that, I believe, is the high one gets working on new designs, getting something new out there, and go go go! Some of it is the fact that many of us just don't know HOW to support a game very well, and/or that we find this more "boring" than designing something new and cool.<br/><br/>The end result is almost a Top 40 style hit parade of the New Hotness in gaming. At worst, it'll lead to a kind of fad-ism, which I find troubling. At best, it means we've got a diverse selection of tightly focused games, which I find exciting.<br/><br/>But, what really troubles me most is that we have a broad, shallow market of many games that, in total, very few people have played. I argue we risk confusing and fragmenting hobbyists who feel overwhelmed by choices, have too little support for making buying AND (more importantly) playing decisions. <br/><br/>I'm arguing we risk it, not that the Titanic is sinking. I think it's something publishers should address. But, then, there's nothing I can do to make a publisher do that. I can point out my observation, and the publisher can take it or leave it. Either way, I think it's something worth discussing.                </div>

I'm in a good position because of <a href="http://sgboston.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">StoryGames Boston</a>, so I've managed to get some play in of many games. Though mostly one-shots, and a lot of them are designed for longer term play (Agon, Don't Rest Your Head, and so on). So I've managed to play almost everything I own, but not necessarily for the length of play they're designed for. 
<blockquote>If you are a game designer, or have inklings to be, how many of the books that you bought did you buy because you consider them interesting or good design influences? (Yes.)</blockquote>
I kind of feel like every game I buy is going to be a design influence. In some cases thats the primary driver behind my purchase, but not always.
<blockquote>Does the number of games you own compared to the number of games you actually play bother you? (Yes, greatly.)</blockquote>
Yes, but I'm making a concerted effort to make this better. I also don't own that many games, compared to many people I know.
<blockquote>What keeps you from playing more games you wish to play? Is it a stubborn or reluctant group? Not enough time? (General disinterest among my play groups, limited time.)</blockquote>
Time. Time time time.
<blockquote>My responses to these questions lead me to some troubling conclusions (troubling to ME at least -- this will not be universal)...</blockquote>
There's a lot of influences here, right? There's the personal stuff, about personal design development, getting stale on a project, and so on. There's our culture of awesome. There's the historical artifact of focused design of short-form games, leading to an overall enviroment of "try it as a oneshot." There's the perception that if you're not participating in the community your not working on anything. And so on.<br/><br/>I was just saying on the way back from JiffyCon that we've pretty firmly established the "new" functional edge of focused RPG design (that is, we've created a set of tools that we know work for the kinds of games we want to create and play), and there's a couple ways to go from here. Some people are really interested in going further, inventing new tools and seeing how they work and interact with the old ones. But I think we also need to concentrate on honing our tools and making them better in the familiar forms. <br/><br/>Now, this is problematic, right, because of things like a general wariness (I think) of "second editions," individual burnout on designs, consumer attraction to the new hotness, and so on. We've got a lot of cross-currents in the community and they're not all mutual.<br/><br/>It's never going to happen, but how interesting would it be if we had a year where literally nobody released a new game? That would be reeeeeeeeeeealy interesting.                        </div>

                            Hey Matt:<br/><br/>I'd say many designers buy another indie game and do actually play it, but they only play once or twice, and that's not enough to really get into what the game is all about.<br/><br/>I mean, can you play chess once and really get a grasp of what it has to offer? Or go?<br/><br/>Also, Meredith is totally psyched about your userpic.                        </div>

Well, what will happen is groups of player, even amongst the indielike scene, will slow down their purchases and just groove on what they have, for the most part - they'll pick up a book or two yearly, but not do the thing of bringing back a "haul" from GenCon. So in effect, they're playstyle will largely be staying within what they know &amp; like best, and honing that.<br/><br/>Matt S., I definitely agree with what you staying. I really do think you should only buy what you are definitely going to play, and very rarely, books that will not be played but will directly inform play that you will be having.                        </div>

                            At GenCon 2005, I bought, like 10 games, but only played like 4 or 5. So this year, I decided I would only buy games I thought I would play, and as a result, only bought 3 (and I'm still waiting to play them). I wanted more, but figured I would wait until I was actually planning a game before I made the order.<br/><br/>I also can say that my previous experience is like what Matt W was saying. Back when I was with the Chicago crew, we would play a bunch of games, but many were one-shots, and our "long" games were only like 4 or 5 sessions.                        </div>

                            Hey, Dev, that casts some light on something I failed to get at in my post: <br/><br/>If we have whole bunches of people buying games for reasons OTHER than playing them (among the reasons: design inspiration, New Hawtness factor, it's my pal's game, etc.), then we are -- not insignificantly -- skewing the market <i>if the assumed goal for the designer is actual play</i>. <br/><br/>Let's say that a good "indie" game sells, oh, 400 copies. That's actually quite a bit given recent history. This would be considered a pretty successful game among us, I think. <br/><br/>Say there are 40 designers who buy it for any number of reasons above (but DON'T play it) in the first couple months. That's 10% of sales! I don't think this is unreasonable. How many designers were at the Forge booth this year? 30? 40? Did all of 'em buy, say, Agon? Did 20? I don't have to stretch very far to come up with a plausible list of names, and the likelihood that they all own a particular game or two (but maybe haven't played).<br/><br/>Is that ok? Is it something one should expect to base future decisions on? Does it bother a designer that fellow designers are buying-and-not-playing? <br/><br/>And, frankly, why SHOULD they? When I look at how little time I have to play others' games, why wouldn't I devote that time to MY games? Shouldn't I?                        </div>

You know I was just discussing this. A number of games at the GenCon booth this year kinda fit into a niche that was already established by an older game. Not that that automatically discounts those games, but I think the danger is that if we lose sight of older games, we might just start re-inventing the wheel instead of trying to move design forward. (Hmmm...That sounds alot like a "heartbreaker"...)                        </div>

                            I think a lot of games that are optimized for multi-session play get the one-shot treatment (Mountain Witch, PTA, MLWM) due to time constraints or other issues.  Of those three I've only "properly" played PTA, and that only once, despite lots and lots of one-shots of all three.  Maybe the take-away here is to make sure your design can provide a meaningful experience in an evening, even if that means special "one shot" rules or whatever.  <br/><br/>I'm a cheap bastard and usually only buy things I'm sure I'll run or play.  I don't buy things I can't <i>imagine </i>myself playing, although I'll buy things that don't seem like a 100% perfect fit for me sometimes if they are exciting or somehow worthy of strong support.  <b>Primitive </b>fit into this latter category for me - I bought it at Gen Con because it embodies a design aesthetic I want to see flourish, is a beautiful object, and also a fun game.  But I'm not sure I'll get to play it.                        </div>

Because we're growing the community of designers so fast (through design contests, and the increasing ease of publishing via POD services). Essentially, we're building a population of designers from among the ranks of the most serious gamers. We're converting serious gamers from compulsively collecting the endless supplements of traditional games to designers compulsively collecting self-published games out of a desire to keep pace. And the evidence is that rather than playing the games we buy as the designer intended, we just scarf them for nifties.<br/><br/>I bought a stack of games at GenCon this summer.

                            Speaking from the pov of a player/consumer:<br/><br/>I can understand the financial/budget reasons for only buying what will get played.  This makes sense.<br/><br/>I can also understand that a designer would rather sell a game to someone who's going to play it rather than to someone who's going to read it and put it on their shelf.<br/><br/>But I don't think there's anything <i>wrong</i> with buying a game that won't get played.  At least, I know I've bought a bunch of games over the last year that I want to play, but, honestly, I also know that I probably will never get a chance to play them.  <br/>I'm not sure this is a bad thing, really.  I mean, I guess I'd rather spend my entertainment budget on an indie-game that might never hit the table than on, say, the Da Vinci Code DVD (or whatever).  And this isn't really something that I feel the least bit of guilt (or regret or anything like that) about.<br/><br/>I do read everything I buy and I do end up playing a lot of different games (16 over the last year or so, less than half of which were one-shots).<br/><br/>At the same time, even though I do have all these unplayed new games, I want to go back and get deeper into some of the games I've already played (especially InSpecters and Trollbabe).  So, though I am an offender of the buy-no-games-that-won't-be-played rule, I can sympathize with the call to pay more attention to games that have been around for a while.                        </div>

                            Jon, to clarify my position (which is maybe unnecessary): <br/><br/>I'm not suggesting that purchasing games-without-play is wrong, per se. I'm raising the question, and encouraging each publisher to answer that for himself or herself (or, possibly, themselves!). I mean, I do it myself. I have a whole bookshelf full-to-burstin' with indie games alone. I've played maybe 3-4 of them in 3-4 years.<br/><br/>But, what does it mean to a publisher? Does it mean including in the business model the fact that some significant percentage will not be played? Is play, in fact, one's goal? <br/><br/>And, this thread has raised some other interesting questions. Jason Morningstar suggests deliberately designing games to be played in one night as an option and/or default assumption. I'm sympathetic; I'm currently trying to design a game to do just that. <br/><br/>But, I also publish a game that would suck as only that. To see Nine Worlds in action, you must play it for more than a session or two. One of the most universally praised games 'round these parts is Prime Time Adventures. Wouldn't it suck if Matt decided that, due to the nature of this cottage industry, PTA should ONLY be played in one night, rather than 12? Boy, that would suck!<br/><br/>So, what I'm getting at is that we're seeing a lot of assumptions take place that effect a lot of things we shouldn't take for granted -- like, how many copies to sell, how to design for a single-sessions, how to better market games, and so on. I'm not seeing a LOT of discussion about this stuff. I'm seeing some. I think more is really important.                        </div>

                            I bought somewhere around six games this year.  I played four (two of which were ones that I bought), all but one were con games.  I think all three of those games were designed to at least play well in the short term, although I don't think they were designed specifically for it.<br/><br/>All of them were bought with at least an eye toward design research.  At this point, anything I read is though.  Yes, the own:play ratio bothers me.  In fact, it bugs the hell out of me.  I don't have a local play group, and I find it difficult to commit to a regular playschedule, so I'm reluctant to try to form one.  Blue, thor and I are putting together a pick up game of SotC, maybe we'll play something else some other time too.<br/><br/>Edit:  Some additional data points to consider.  Spirit of the Century apparently comes with rules to make it easier to play as a pickup game.  Judd recently discovered that PTA is <i>even more awesome</i> than he'd thought after playing a season for the first time.                        </div>

<b>How many books did you buy, say, this year? How many did you actually play?</b><br/><br/>I'd say 5 or 6 games (two or three times that many books). I've got more on the way though, by years end it'll probably be around 12. Of those I've played less than half. <br/><br/>Most years I'd be better than that, but the 4 months in India kinda messed up my schedual a bit and I was playing catchup from my GenCon haul from the year before.  <br/><br/>However, I will say that even with all the AP I've had over the last several years that my ratio of games bought to games actually played has been much lower than I should find acceptable if I were as all about AP as I like to think I am. <br/><br/><b>Were those actually played games really designed for short or one-off games? Or, did you devote some time to them?</b><br/><br/>Some of them were. At least two of them certainly were not, and even though I've played a one-off of one of those two (Artesia) I would in no way say that I fully explored the system not figured it out in any deep way. Others its harder to say, I did a one-shot of Nine Worlds, which could be a short run game, but I know my session didn't do it justice considering that when I saw Matt on Skype the next day my first words to him were "Matt, I screwed up Nine Worlds." <br/><br/><b>If you are a game designer, or have inklings to be, how many of the books that you bought did you buy because you consider them interesting or good design influences?</b><br/><br/>Probably a full half. Maybe more. Some of it I actually turned into work, much of it I didn't. Really, I think there is a way in which we have an invisible marketing strand in the community that sells to would-be-designers the same way that we accuse trad companies of selling to would-be players. Instead of getting them to dream about the game they could play we get them to dream of the game they could design, and sell them an endless stream of examples of how to publish your own game. <br/><br/><b>Does the number of games you own compared to the number of games you actually play bother you? </b><br/><br/>Only in so much as it is growing, despite the fact that I'm now part of the "AP matters" brigade. There was a point around 2002ish where I had played every single game I owned. Now I'm not even close. Which is funny, because in those days I was part of the group that bought lots of books that they never intended to play with, and spent a lot of time thinking about how cool gaming could be. <br/><br/>I think one of the differences that helps explain that, however, is that in those days I bought few actual games and lots of supplements for the games I bought. Now I buy lots of games with few supplements. So buying 20 books a year in 1999 might mean that I only had to play 3 games to "play all the games I own" (though I probably wouldn't come close to "using material from all the books I own") whereas now I buy 10 games a year and so have to play 10 games to give them all a go. <br/><br/><b>What keeps you from playing more games you wish to play? Is it a stubborn or reluctant group? Not enough time? </b><br/><br/>Time. At this point my extended group is buying Indie RPGs on their own and playing them without me, so they're all good to go. <br/><br/>But look, I play 2 to 3 times a week when I'm not out of the country. Of those 2 slots will be taken up by long running games that will usually take a full year to play out (Burning Empires, Exalted, Unknown Armies, whatever). So that's 2 games a year. The third slot will be filled by shorter-run games, but will be filled less often because of the preasures of being an adult who plays with adults that all have children. So it will probably happen 2 times a month rather than 4. So even if its only a series of 6 games that'll take up 3 months. So that's about 4 more games a year -- a total of 6. <br/><br/>In there I'll often get a lot of one-shots off. But a lot of games aren't really designed for one shots at their maximum payoff style. PTA as a oneshot is not the same as a full season. Nor is a oneshot of Burning Empires or Artesia anything like a real full play experience of those games. So it's only games like Breaking the Ice that I'll consider fully played if I've only done one time at it. (Though even that is cheap, because I know I would do better with Breaking the Ice if I played a dozen more times.)<br/><br/>Online play probably adds another game per year to the total. So, including games meant to be one-shots but excluding games not meant to be that I only play once, I'd say I get in maybe 9 to 10 full game experiences a year. <br/><br/>This year I'm buying 12ish games. Last year I bought like 20. The math is not in favor of me playing anything near the total tally of my games in a "full game experience" way if I buy any more games next year.                        </div>

                            I used to buy a ton more games that I would never play, but haven't bought any new games for several years until this year. I bought three, and I've played two of them. The other one, which I'd love to play, seems like too much work to play.<br/><br/>As a game designer, one could look at buying games as researching the market and keeping up with the competition. There's nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>At least, games don't run $1000 like the canoe in the garage that I love, but I never paddle because my other canoe is more practical for the type of paddling I do.                        </div>

                            Well, I will say that there are basically <b>way</b> more really, really cool games coming out than I could conceivably get the time to really fully understand.<br/><br/>To really get a handle of TSoY, for instance, I played a campaign of it.  That was my gaming for about two months.  And, to be honest, I could go back to the TSoY well many, many times and still get a lot more understanding of the game and ability to use it.<br/><br/>In those two months, people put out ... heh ... more than one new game.  I'm falling behind.<br/><br/>One of the (perhaps unnoticed) benefits of "hot new picks" is that a critical mass of people actually get enough play to understand the benefits of the system, and then they can <i>talk about it</i>.<br/><br/>Fan-mail, for instance.  The benefits of that design choice have entered the collective consciousness of designers.  There are plenty of <i>equally good techniques</i> that are in less popular games which have not got that sort of coherent representation.  If I want to build upon a foundation of (for instance) the plot-arc mechanics from WGP then I have to do it, for the most part, on my own.  I can't count on everybody knowing that system well enough to talk with me about it.                        </div>

                            I've bought a lot of indie games over the years.  Sometimes, I bought a game just to read the book and see what the fuss was about.  Usually, I wound up learning something cool about game design.  Other times, I just bought a game because I wanted to play it.  My gaming group was interested in playing a Star Wars game a couple years back, so I bought Paladin.  We had fun with it.  I've learned some cool new game design stuff from such experiences as well, but the primary goal  was to get a game going with the guys.<br/><br/>I don't play all the games that I buy.  I'd like to, but the gaming group isn't always interested.  Besides, we don't get together as often as we used to, and there's only so much water in the well.<br/><br/>I also buy novels and then find them on my bookshelf, waiting patiently, years later.  Nothing to worry about, just how it goes.<br/><br/>Same for video games.  I bought Doom 3 and only got through the first couple missions.  Same for Half-Life 2 and Marvel Ultimate Alliance.  As a video game designer, I need to know what's going on in the market, and as a video game enthusiast, I like to play new games (even if only for a couple of hours).<br/><br/>I tend to look at tabletop the same way.  If I shelled out twenty or thirty bucks for someone's game, and I haven't played it yet, well, what the hell.  I supported indie publishing and I've got a cool game waiting for me.  One of these days I'll actually run a game of Le Mon Mouri or Knights of the Road, Knights of the Rail.  Just a matter of talking my gaming group into it, or temporarily hooking up with another group that's interested in a one-shot or something.  It really doesn't bother me.  Only so many hours in the day.  Besides, my intentions are good.  It's not like I'm collecting indie games so that I can point to a library of inkjet-printed-and-stapled PDF games to impress people.<br/><br/>If someone buys a copy of Dread and doesn't play it, I'm not going to worry about it.  Enough people still play the game four years later that I'm happy with the way things turned out.<br/><br/>I think that the best thing indie designers and publishers can do is to communicate with people outside the scene.  It's a great scene, but it's full of other designers and publishers, many of whom are perpetually playtesting their own games (myself included).  This paragraph was going to be longer, but I can't remember all the other stuff I was going to say.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt_Snyder</cite>Rafael, if you think of more to say in that last paragraph, do tell. It's the one I found most interesting!</blockquote>
Well, then, let me hasten to disappoint you.  Aaaaaaand let me apologize for the length of this post.  And for the fact that it's mostly just impressions and feelings, as opposed to useful data points.<br/><br/>I guess I kind of ran out of steam on that last paragraph there because I'm remarkably ill-informed, and will probably need a Bud Light to wash my foot down if I ramble on about the scene for too long.  But, you know, it does seem a little insular sometimes.  I think there's a lot that's being done to expose mainstream gamers to what's going on, and I think that's great.  But it appears to me that we can do more.  I'm not sure what, yet.<br/><br/>In a way, the indie game scene is a little daunting.  I still feel like an outsider a lot of the time, because I read a post about someone talking about Game X, and I have no idea what they're talking about.  Not like, I don't know the game.  I mean, I don't understand what language they're speaking.  They're using terms I know nothing about.  The thing is, a lot of game sites (and PR materials) are crafted similarly.  It's like one of those scenes where if you already know, then you know, and if you don't know, you never will.  And I realize that's not intentional -- but designers speak their own language, which is different from the language of the user.  I make a lot of comparisons to the video game industry (far too many, I'm sure), but in the game biz, we talk about games one way when designing/developing them, and another way when marketing them.  In the indie game scene, the line appears to blur.  I have no idea if any of the aforementioned made sense.  I guess I'm saying that the terminology is a barrier to entry, and it's not just on the behind-the-scenes discussions.  It's a lot of the public presentation.  I go to a game site, read the text, click through a few pages, and I still have no idea what I'm about to order via PayPal.<br/><br/>Another issue that I see is that these indie games deliver a user experience that's remarkably like the Wii in some regards.  The Wii is garnering a substantial buzz for Nintendo this year because it offers an experience with a low barrier to entry -- perhaps lower than the DS, in fact.  I mean, who doesn't know how to swing a tennis racket, or cast a fishing rod?  It's a toy, in some ways, as opposed to a traditional video game console.  And the conventional wisdom holds that its appeal will result in a crossover with audiences that are normally wary of video games (due in some cases to their complexity or unfamiliarity).<br/><br/>Story games have the potential for a similar crossover, in my mind, because they are easier to grasp (mechanically), and because they are familiar (who doesn't know how to tell a story?).  Maybe I'm oversimplifying here, but it seems like a lot of story games would go over well with those who are curious about tabletop gaming, but who lack the experience.<br/><br/>Personally, my story goes something like this.  I had a couple of buddies, typical nerds.  But!  They'd never done tabletop.  They always wanted to, but didn't know enough about it, didn't have any friends with books or dice, yada yada.  One night, we're hanging out drinking beer, and one of 'em says, hey, is that a D&amp;D book?  Few weeks later, we play our first game.  Roll!  I miss.  Roll initiative.  Which die is that?  Low or high?  I miss.  Can I jump off the roof and land on his back, then stick the dagger in his ear?  Which one do I roll if I want to do that?  Wait, which one's the d8?<br/><br/>So, I reconsidered.  The game was too complex, they couldn't do the cool stuff they wanted to, et cetera.  But, there were other games out there, and I discovered the Forge, and the next thing you know, we're doing Star Wars Paladin.  It works great.  Aha, I think.  Just perfect.  They grasp the game mechanics easily, they get to do cool things, and they don't feel like ineffectual rat-killers.  (Now, don't get me wrong, I still love D&amp;D and would play it at the drop of a hat, but it just didn't work out for this gaming group.)<br/><br/>Now, these dudes are probably not alone.  There's a veritable army of geeks out there in similar circumstances.  Not as much free time as we had during adolescence, so those five-night-a-week gaming campaigns are not so likely these days.  Maybe once every couple of weeks, or once a month.  So, is a game where you start off fighting rabbits, then build up to kobolds over the space of a year, really going to work for you?  I'd guess no.  If you're a complete novice gamer, and you want to just play a game and do something cool, then I think you could do a damn sight worse than a game like Sorcerer.<br/><br/>Here's the other thing.  While playtesting my game, Dread, I once ran a game session with four women.  These broads had never played an RPG, except for my wife, with whom I played Sorcerer.  And they really got into it.  But they didn't seem to be aware of the limitations that more experienced players seem to worry about when I run games at a con.  Experienced gamers are concerned about repercussions -- What if we get caught?  Who's watching the back?  I look up, do I see anything?<br/><br/>But these novice gamers were pretty much playing for fun.  Why worry about getting caught?  Obviously, we're the stars of the show, so we can't go to jail.<br/><br/>I don't know if what I'm saying here makes sense, but I guess I feel like there's a huge audience of people with nerdy tendencies who would definitely enjoy the indie game scene if we could make contact.  And, I guess when I mentioned being remarkably ill-informed at the beginning, I was referring to this conclusion well in advance, because I'm sure that someone's going to tell me about a game publisher that's been doing exactly that.<br/><br/>But, these are all mostly just impressions and gut feelings at this point.  Dot dot dot.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt_Snyder</cite>In short, I think the indie scene suffers from designers --<i>myself included</i>-- who love design so much that they'd rather create and publish Yet Another Game than support the solid designs they already have.

I don't think this is true. I think the issue is that we're seeing an explosion in the popularity of the indie scene, and much of the growth we're seeing in from new designers, not the old hats.<br/><br/>Most Forge publishers don't put out more than a game a year--actually, most publishers are putting out maybe one every two years. There are a few fluke cases of people like Troy C who has written 4 or 5 games over the last 2 years or so. But a game every year or two doesn't sound all that obsessed. That sounds like a healthy rate for a single designer. Most Forge designers only have *maybe* 2 fully published games under their belts.<br/><br/>But look at the number of designers that are at the Forge booth each year, it keeps going up and up. <br/><br/>I think the perception might be that people are designing more and more, due to all these contests and such. But still, only a minority of these games get the full published treatment. Many still sit half-finished.                        </div>

                            I suspect that there are three different tensions:<br/><br/>1) <b>Create fun play!</b> Experience awesomeness! Blow everyone's socks off!<br/>2) <b>Design fun games!</b> Express yourself creatively! Gain the adoration of dozens!<br/>3) <b>Publish fun games!</b> Have shiney books! Sell them to people! Join the in-crowd!<br/><br/>These are obviously related but not the same. I do think there is danger in letting the latter two dominate. That creates a great hobby publishing community, but we might as well be publishing art or fiction if the real goal is fun play. My early thoughts on pushing towards <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1213" rel="nofollow">non-commercial roleplaying</a> were definitely influenced by the same concerns you express here, Matt. <br/><br/>I'm still unsure if there's a real solution to this problem, or even what the problem actually is, but it's definitely worth discussing more.                        </div>

How about MySpace?  I got a page with about 350 people on it.  Admittedly, many are experienced tabletop gamers, not novices.  I send out bulletins every couple weeks, as opposed to daily, so that it doesn't feel like spam, and I'm pretty sincere about what I tell them.  Try to keep the marketing copy to a minimum, just tell them who I am, what I'm doing, what's up with my game.  People ask questions, and I answer, and we have cool conversations.  It's a good way to connect.  Other sites like Facebook may also achieve similar goals.  Same goes for game blogs.  If I was to blog, it would definitely be a plain-English blog about my experiences designing and testing the game, complete with numerous explanations and definitions.<br/><br/>College kids are a great target audience.  They have the free time, the low level of obligation, and the social connections.  And the disposable income, too, come to think of it.  I'm totally canvassing college campuses with fliers for my game early next year (where permitted).<br/><br/>Anime is big.  Every time I see mention of Andy K's Tetris Banjo Zima (sorry, dude), I keep thinking that he should try to buy ad space at anime cons (like Anime South or Anime Mid-Atlantic, both in Virginia).  Even though they're not gaming cons, there's a lot of crossover potential there.<br/><br/>I think the same could be said for other genres as well.  Not all of 'em, but a lot.  Got a supers game?  Talk to the comic store manager about leaving fliers or posters.  Hell, give him a copy.  That kind of thing.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>

                            I agree with Rafael's points about cross marketing. However, as with all things, I'm going to tell you that you need to go in with a strong plan of attack, a marketing angle, and a willingess to bust your ass. I've sold RPGs at non-RPG cons (comics, anime, and sci-fi) and it is a vast uphill struggle. You can't just go in with the same approach you take at GenCon, you've got to hit a core appeal of the target audience and ride it hard. Even then expect an uphill fight. <br/><br/>But if you can crack the new market, the rewards could be big.                        </div>

                            I don't buy games that I don't intend to play. That is, I look at the game in question, think about how much I might like to play, envision who I'd play it with, when and where, and if I can see it getting played, then I buy it. That doesn't garuntee that it'll get played...I've been sitting on my copy of Wyrd is Bond for a couple of years now. I've tried to start it up, however, and do intend to play at some point. Just hasn't happened yet.<br/>
<br/>
That said...I'm probably a horrible datapoint. I don't have any excess income to purchase new games with. Else I might be tempted to buy one here or there to say to a designer, "I like where you're going, keep at it." Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Worse, I see probably more games than anyone else pre-publication. For various reasons, I end up editing or judging many, many games that eventually get published. Or just help with the design. So I really don't have the excuse to buy Burning Empires. I helped edit it before it came out. I know how it works as intimately as one can without having played the thing.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I think that at some point I <i>will</i> buy Burning Empires (it's a kickass game). I'd like to play it. The problem is that I'm like Brand. Right now I'm into Hero Quest, and looooong play of that system. I'll get over it at some point, however, and move on to new games like Burning Empires. In the meanwhile I'll play occasional games of stuff like InSpectres. We played a couple of weeks ago. Yeah, I know that InSpectres is best played over a few sessions at least. I even said so in the session. And we gathered the info on the characters and such just in case it does happen. If it does.<br/>
<br/>
But I have no obligation to either buy or play more games. Nobody does. Can any of you really say that you're not already playing as much as your time can afford? Or that you're not playing what you want to play? That's your obligation, to play what you like, have fun doing it (and maybe post about it, if it makes sense to do so). We don't all have to be an advocate for all RPGs that are created that we might possibly like if we played them. Because - and I know this for a fact - you can't play them all. Nobody has that much time. Even if it was a full time job that you got paid for, you couldn't do so. Ken Hite can't even read and review all of them.<br/>
<br/>
So, as usual, I'm seeing people feeling guilt over the fact that they're human. Well, get over it, y'all.<br/>

Tim, I don't think we're talking about quite the same thing. Yes, I agree with you about the actual number of PUBLISHED games. <br><br>This is not what I'm criticizing: "I have three published games, but I only do a good job supporting the newest one."<br><br>This is what I'm talking about: "I have one published game ... and one or more in the oven. I spend time designing the new one(s), to the detriment of the one I'm already selling. Minutes I spend doing that are minutes I spend not doing the other."                        </br></br></br></br></div>

What I'm saying is -- given my lazy, procrastinating ass -- doing this is much less compelling that "Hey, I can scribble more dice mechanics in my notebook over lunch!"<br><br>And that this is a problem. Yes, it's MY problem.

                            I skew the results a bit, since I end up with one of everything on IPR. Needless to say, I have not gotten to play all of these. Still, I started a group specifically to try out all of these games. We generally get only one session of play, though, and due to a rotating cast of gamers each Friday, trying to sustain a game over multiple weeks has not worked.<br><br>That said, I pick up games (those I buy) because they interest me and I intend to play them. I will eventually get around to them, I think, but it might take a while. I also peruse them for interesting tidbits of design.<br/><br/>I lucked out with Mortal Coil, because it plays great in about 4 hours. This was not really intentional, but it fits the one-shot need quite well, which is great for me. It also supports longer-term play, which is also great, because it's appropriate for groups who want to explore their shared world over a greater period of time. I wish I was a genius and had done this on purpose, but it really was a happy accident.                        </br></br></div>

                            I think it's a valid issue, from a player's perspective, and I have to say that my experience since starting up a Vancouver storygames playgroup is that the urge to jump to the next awesome-game-we-haven't-played-yet-but-have-heard-so-much-about is very strong. We're focusing on getting a Sorceror game running now, but pretty much every week involves a new 'what game should we play?' discussion, even if we left the last session halfway through a game. There's always a lot of possible games floated, and games which seem to definitely require longer-term play are less likely to be chosen. That said, I think the group has noticed that this trend is probably not the best idea (as evidenced by the fact that we're now committing to some longer-term games like Sorceror.)<br/><br/>As it turns out, I feel like a lot of this is motivated by the 'I own all these games I haven't played' feeling described throughout this thread. If you think that buying a game and not playing it is a bad idea, then you are motivated to 'play' games quickly, so you can get on to 'playing' the next one. Then it just comes down to what you think counts as 'playing' -- for the purposes of justifying your purchases, offsetting guilt, or whatever else it is that makes you care about buying a game and not playing it. <br/><br/>If you're rigorous about achieving what Brand calls a 'full play experience' with every game before moving on, then this isn't a problem; on the other hand, if you can never get that little 'this game is fun, but I could be playing X right now instead!' voice out of your head, you're probably going to end up with a lot of books on your shelves that you've 'played' only symbolically. Just like I have all those books on my shelves from school that I 'read' during my classes, and couldn't tell you what made it a worthwhile book.                        </div>

                            If I understand Matt's basic premise, I think the real point here is that game designers naturally prefer to spend as much time designing games as possible.  The farther away you get from that point (such as playtesting, editing, publishing, selling, marketing, etc.), the less interesting the task typically is to a game designer, so it's easy to choose not to spend as much time on it.  That's why a one-man show is so hard to pull off in any kind of game development.  You really need a team of several specialists working full-time on different parts of the development and publishing process to consistently put out product that sells well.<br/><br/>Right now the indie games scene is selling mainly to itself and to a very small subset of curious players from other gaming genres.  But it's really hard to move past that and still keep it as a "fun hobby".   It takes a commitment of time and focus on things other than interesting mechanics and themes.  And it also takes a commitment to making games that a wider audience is going to want to play.  The current indie story games are typically very focused in nature.  This makes logical sense since they are appealing mainly to a group of people who already like indie story games and want to see innovation.  But the end result is that when looking at the customer pyramid, these games keep bumping up against the sharp (and small) tip of "hardcore" first adopters instead of aggressively moving towards the fat end with all of those non-gamers and lite-gamers.  <br/><br/>This trend can certainly continue, but it will always be a niche market with little room for category growth.  So instead of five titles vying for those thousands of potential customers, in not too long there are going to be fifty good-quality titles fighting for those same people.  You need to greatly expand the overall customer base in order to fully support the increasing number of titles being released.                        </div>

                            Also, some of us just aren't interested in putting a lot of time and effort into things like marketing. No amount of guilt or increased sales or reaching of new audiences is likely to get people excited about doing something that doesn't excite them. I'd rather just focus on playing more games, honestly. I'm not quite ready to fight for new audiences yet, nor do I really have a product I can offer them. Eventually, perhaps.                        </div>

<br/>
<b>Games Played in the Last Twelve Months</b><br/>
Trollbabe, Capes, With Great Power, Primetime Adventures, Mechaton (partial).  Working on BTI, darn it.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Time Spent Per Game</b><br/>
Capes, PTA, WGP -- 3-4 sessions.  TB, Mechaton -- one-shots, so far, though I'd like to play more.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Reasons Limiting the Playing of Games</b><br/>
Time.  But my thinking is, if I'm spending money on a game, I damn well better play it.  I'm on a student budget, so a $20 entertainment expenditure usually means going without meals or staying at home more than I'd like.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Frustration Factor for Unplayed Games?</b><br/>
It used to bug the HELL out of me.  I finally solved the problem by throwing away/selling/deleting all my RPG's, except for the ones that I absolutely had to play.  I'm down to about 8 RPGs that I've decided: "Hey, this is it for me.  I want to play these, and preferrably ONLY these, for a few months at time.  When I'm done with one or the other, I'll add another to the rotation."<br/>
<br/>
<b>Tangential Comment from an Ignoramus</b><br/>
It does seem like y'all are big into 'inventing new games.'  Which is what design should be about.  But maybe that's a reflection of the one-man do-it-yourself POD economic situation?  Like, at the far other extreme, the folks at D&amp;D can't invent new games because D&amp;D is a big business, and there's investor money and jobs on the line.  With the indie thing, games become more like punk albums in the 80's -- there's a new one every month, and the idea is to love it passionately for a brief while, and then move on.                        </div>

                            I used to buy way too many RPG books as either reading material or for design reference. On the one hand I strongly suspect that without some of those kinds of purchases I wouldn't be anywhere near as happy with my own design work, but on the other hand I've been trying to "clean up" my buying habits, and avoid buying games if I don't have at least some inkling of possibly playing them some time. This is lots of things at once; I know there are things about these games that can't be seen without playing them, I want to spend less money in general, and lately I've been so busy that I have to really budget my free time, so it's getting harder even to make time to read all these games.<br><br>Considering that my gaming group is currently about 50% unemployed  and 90% single, I'm hoping that my efforts to start up a weekly gaming group and actually play all these games I've accumulated -- as well as playtesting my own stuff more thoroughly -- will work out. If things go well I'll be running Panty Explosion this Thursday.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafael</cite>Anime is big.  Every time I see mention of Andy K's Tetris Banjo Zima (sorry, dude), I keep thinking that he should try to buy ad space at anime cons (like Anime South or Anime Mid-Atlantic, both in Virginia).  Even though they're not gaming cons, there's a lot of crossover potential there.</blockquote>
Considering most of the games I'm working on are at least tangentially related to anime or some kind of otaku media, I've thought about doing just that. FanimeCon, which had over 10,000 attendees this year, is practically on my doorstep. I think I could qualify for an Artists' Alley table, which would be dirt cheap. I'll probably wait until I have say 3 or more crazy anime games to sell though. And I might be able to work something out with the con's tabletop gaming department... This is sounding more and more like a good idea. Doubly so since I could probably share a table with one or two of my artist friends.<br><br>I'm inclined to agree with Jonathan's opinions on marketing. While if I go to the trouble of putting out a game I'd like to see it sell more, marketing just doesn't seem like an appealing activity to me. On the plus side I have a friend who works in marketing -- if kind of a flaky one -- that I can go to for advice on that kind of stuff.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

I'd be happy to (or, at least do so from my experience and some close pals to draw on). Can you clarify a bit more specifically which "it" you're referring to, though? I think I lost track.                        </div>

                            I bought most indie games released in the past year of so - upwards of 20. Since our gaming group has focused on playtesting our own designs (agora, cage of reason, flfs, george's children, heads of state x9, joy division, repetoire, un-named spy game) I have played 5 other games in 2006: ditv (2-3 sessions), pta, tsoy, capes &amp; polaris (1 session each).<br><br>I'm not sure whether the increased output of new games will (A) lead to a 'peak-games' scenario in which a base of players that's growing slower than the number of new titles ends up decreasing the amount of sales and attention each new product gets to the point that fewer designers bother to publish. It could be that gen con indie 06 <b>was</b> that peak, or maybe it will come in 07...<br><br>or (B) people continue to write and publish new games since imagination isn't petroleum, and as a result there are more, and more varied, games. This would probably weaken the sense of community that existed when there were 4-8 games that 'everyone' had played and could reference and be influenced by. <br><br>I often care more about a game's concept or a particular element of its design or presentation than I do about how much use I'll get from it in terms of repeat play. (I believe system matters - but sometimes less than other stuff). So I'm happy to keep buying games I may never play (and, since I'm not a very rigorous designer) that I may never mine for ideas.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            If I had more money to spend on games, I would probably buy more games. I would love to have a definitive menu of games for spur-of-the-moment sessions. To be able to pull out the perfect game for the company!                        </div>

<p>I only buy things that I intend to play. I didn't buy anything at GC2006 because a) I don't want to be the reason someone sells out before some other person could get their hands on something good and b) I'm there to meet people, play games, and make money. Spending money is kind of contrary to those.</p>
<p>In the last year, we've played Shock: (because I was developing it, and later because we wanted to play), Sign In Stranger (because Emily's developing it), Shooting the Moon, (because Emily <em>was</em> developing it), Dogs in the Vineyard (because Vincent and I never get to play; we always GM), Polaris, Agon, and Sorcerer (currently). We've got four or so sessions of Sorcerer to go and then we'll play something else. Outside of my group at cons, I've played With Great Power..., Mortal Coil, Cold City, and Shock: (and I'm probably forgetting a couple).</p>
<p>In my home group, we'll play what we need to play to do the kinds of things we want to do. At cons, I want to play things I don't know about to gain new experiences and maybe bring them to our group.</p>
<p>So here's my situation: I want to get a copy of Agon because I've played it. It does some things that I want to do in the future and I want to play it more in order to know how it does it. When I've got some cash, I'll do that. Cuz right now, we're busy playing a 7 year-old game.</p>

<p>Oh: I'm OK with people buying my game and not playing it. It makes it more likely that someone will see the bright orange stripe on the shelf and wonder what it's about. At the very least, it's publicity (which leads to buying and playing) and a sale. At most, it's publicity, sale, and AP down the line.</p>

<em>It makes it more likely that someone will see the bright orange stripe on the shelf and wonder what it's about.</em><br/><br/>My copy of Shock: is wrapped in a special UV resistant cloth, down in the basement, under the litter box. For safe keeping. For posterity, even.<br/><br/>But still, the cats are down there going, "my tagonist is named Don Piano." So I guess it works.<br/><br/>As for me, I bought a handful of games at GenCon, haven't played a one except Agon. It's very sad. The lack of play, I mean. Not Agon.                        </div>

                            Strangely, since Gen Con this year, I've been playing and running more games than in the last couple of years combined. More importanly, I'm getting an immense amount of enjoyment out of running and playing games these days. Out of the haul I brough back from GC, I've managed to play/run Perfect, Best Friends, Covenant, The Roach, Contenders, Mob Justice and at least one other I'm forgetting. Although, this still leaves Shock:, Drowning &amp; Falling, Mortal Coil, Burning Empires,  and a bunch of others to have a go at. Then there's also been games of DitV, Dust Devils and the beginnings of a Nobilis game. There seems to have been more quality gaming packed into the last few months than any time over the past few years. More to the point, as I said before, it's all proving to be immense fun.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>

                            I've only got about 5 games on my shelf that I haven't played yet. Seven Leagues, Nine Worlds, Agon, Contenders, Qin and Burning Empires. OK, that's six. Oh, Mortal Coil: Seven.  But considering I got probably over 30 games in the last 3 years, am involved in 2-3 gaming groups and do more gaming now than at any point in my life, I say that I'm on the happy side of things.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Fashionably late to the party again...<br/><br/>To answer your questions Matt:<br/><br/><b>How many books did you buy, say, this year? How many did you actually play?</b><br/>This year I bought I think four books (Burning Empires, Cold City, Lacuna, and something that escapes me).  So far I played Burning Empires<br/><br/><b>Were those actually played games really designed for short or one-off games? Or, did you devote some time to them? </b><br/>We played through two maneuvers over five sessions I believe (we play about 4 hours almost weekly).<br/><br/><b>If you are a game designer, or have inklings to be, how many of the books that you bought did you buy because you consider them interesting or good design influences?</b><br/>I bought Lacuna exactly for that.  I intend to play it sometime within the next year, but I bought it more for the layout and what Jared did with the text.  I'm an art whore and it appeals to my design style...<br/><br/><b>Does the number of games you own compared to the number of games you actually play bother you? </b><br/>Nah.  Over the last year I have dumped a ton of shit and buy stuff only with the intention of using it in some capacity, be it for layout ideas or actual play.<br/><br/><b>What keeps you from playing more games you wish to play? Is it a stubborn or reluctant group? Not enough time? </b><br/>Time mostly.  There are some things my group wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole, but we agree mostly on those so it really is a non-issue.<br/><br/>I see what you are getting at Matt.  It does seem that folks are always working on the design for their next game.  I've suffered from it a bit myself.  It is easy to let that happen.  We are creative people and always looking to make something new and interesting.  <br/><br/>I think it does sort of turn into a top 40 hit parade. Sure a lot of the new hotness is coming from new designers and shit, but how many of us are working on our next project.  Fucking everyone.<br/><br/>You know who doesn't though and who I think has a model we can all see as effective?  Crane.  He is always working on something for BW, always encouraging fans to contribute to his forum and wiki, and always looking to expand the material for the game.                        </div>

<b>Of all of us who've played Burning Wheel, has anyone here played a long enough campaign to have had characters who got to earn and spend multiple Deeds points?</b><br/>I played in a two year long campaign which you can read about on the BW boards (search for Burning Midnight).  It convinced me more than anything that BW is best as a long term game.  The rewards are just so much better.                        </div>

When we played that long term game, we where Artha earning machines.  But you don't see some of the awesomeness in short run games, like Trait votes.                        </div>

                            I want to speak up again to offer some contrasting opinions.  I really have no expectation of playing all of the games that I buy.  I don't have a steady play group and I mostly play when I visit home or at conventions, which are pretty rare occurrences.<br/><br/>I enjoy reading games.  For one thing, I enjoy designing them as a hobby, so it's fun for me to see what other people have done to achieve their goals.  For another, it gives me a pool of cool games to try out when I do have an opportunity.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean that I don't <i>want</i> to play them.  I just know that I won't get to all of them.  I'll take the ones that I'm the keenest on and try to get in a game.  And I'll play the games other people want to play with me.  And the rest?  No such luck.<br/><br/>If I only bought games I expected to play I wouldn't be into indie stuff at all.  What fun would that be?<br/><br/>Edit:  Crossposted with the last 16 (!) posts.                        </div>

                            Interestingly I'm in agreement with Jonathan for once (and others who are agreeing with him).<br/>
<br/>
Let's try this from another perspective. Mr. Snyder, which of your games can now be considered a non-success due to your lack of support, and/or the lack of others who've purchased your games not playing them?<br/>
<br/>
All successes you say? No?<br/>
<br/>
Ron's whole dealie in describing Indie Design is that we all define our own goals for what "success" means to us. And the model seems to be creating success after success. No, not because we set the bar too low, but because we have realistic goals for the extant market, and the number of games that are produced.<br/>
<br/>
Did we see some games get "forgotten" this year at The Forge booth? Sure, perhaps there's a zillion designs out there. But if that means that a Darwinian winnowing of the herd occurs to put it back in line, then so be it. Even if that means losing good games.<br/>
<br/>
Because, again, no, you and I aren't responsible for the success of Keith's game. Well, especially not me, as I had nothing to do with the Forge Booth again this year. And, outside of the booth, the only responsibility I have to Keith's game is to play it if I think it'd be fun to play.<br/>
<br/>
(I happen to think it'd be fun to play, but I think that's ancillary to the point).<br/>
<br/>
What's Keith's responsibilty to his game? Only Keith can say.<br/>

                            In China they say "mathafahker," with a lot of spittle involved. And the TH sound is real weird.<br><br>What Mike said. However many copies I sell, my projects are successes in my book because I get to work with some of my favorite people to produce things that I think are awesome. I sure as hell learn a lot from ever single project I work on, and my own play is better because of it. Sales is just icing on the cake. And that's the attitude I hope to bring to everything I do. <br><br>Money ain't a thing. Sales ain't a thing. Other people's actual play ain't even a thing, unless you're playing with them and share responsibility for it. Ultimately, you have to be doing this to please yourself and live up to your own expectations. We can talk about the market and the community and providing support and the like, but people will keep doing what makes them happy.  And if they're not happy, they'll look for other approaches.<br><br>I highly respect folks who approach indie rpg publishing very differently than I do, but I expect them to respect my approach too. The whole point of doing this independently is so that you are only accountable to yourself.  If you want to talk about the pros and  cons of approaching things in different ways, I'm totally down.  But feeling guilt about not doing X, Y, or Z is crap.  Especially if X, Y, and Z may not be the right goals for this particular project.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Mike, Nine Worlds has suffered from a lack of actual play that fails to meet my expectations.<br><br>Dust Devils suffers from NOT BEING IN PRINT while I design other work. That's pretty much as un-supported as it gets. Pretty damn hard to market the game when there's no product to sell, and harder still to explain why I'd bother letting a successful game like that languish for months as I tinker on this or that design that may or may not be successful itself.<br><br>That pretty much settles it! Which of my games? Both of them!<br><br>What the fuck has Keith got to do with it, exactly? I didn't bring him up. I didn't even think of him when writing this thread.

                            I have a large and continuously expanding collection, spanning both "traditional" and "indie" games. As of last week, the only one I haven't played is Perfect, and that's only because I just got it in the mail.<br>
<br>
I buy games to play them. With perhaps two exceptions ever, any game I pick up is played within a month. Most people I know don't have the drive I do to play everything they own; and that's perfectly fine with me.<br/>
<br/>
It has nothing to do with "getting my money's worth" or anything like that, I just like to play games. As often as possible. ;)                        </br></br></div>

                            Eeep!  I feel I must be the lone weirdo who's not a game designer and buys all the stuff the rest of you publish.  You can all thank me later...<br/>
<br/>
<b>How many books did you buy, say, this year? How many did you actually play?</b><br/>
<br/>
Ahem.  Embarrassing question, compounded by the fact that my husband is also a gamer and impulse buyer, so our household purchases look very bad.  :-(<br/>
<br/>
Let's see: I'll list the disaster, putting the ones I actually played, run or used as sourcebooks.  <b>Mutant &amp; Masterminds</b>, with the <b>GM screen</b> and the sourcebooks <b>Freedom City</b> and Lockdown (it was a gift certificate!); <b>octaNe</b>, Lacuna, InSpectres; Hard Nova; Space and Steel; True 20; Trollbabe; Conspiracy X (Unisystem); Artesia; Cat, Thirty; <b>Truth &amp; Justice</b>, Dead Inside; Faery's Tale; Welcome to Necroamerica (Xcrawl sourcebook); Mythic Russia (Hero Quest); The Princes' Kingdom; <b>Hollow Earth Expedition</b>; Marvel Superheroes SAGA (used); D6 Space (used); and those are just the purchases that I <i>think</i> I was responsible for.  My husband also got a bunch of other things like Burning Wheel, <b>Burning Empires</b>, Midnight, Cold Space, FTL Now, and some other stuff I don't remember because I was not very interested.  A|State, maybe.  I also downloaded bunches of free games.<br/>
<br/>
I also caught up on playing a number of games bought last year, and in 2007 I hope to run some of the ones I purchased this year.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<b>Were those actually played games really designed for short or one-off games? Or, did you devote some time to them?</b><br/>
<br/>
M&amp;M and associated books I first got because I was in a campaign that turned out to be unexpectedly short, but I liked it enough to use it to run a campaign of my own (in progress.)  Truth &amp; Justice and Hollow Earth Expedition were short-run by my husband; I ran octaNe as a two-parter; and we're playing Burning Empires right now (scheduled for 12 games, we've just played our fourth but it looks like it could stretch longer than planned because the disposition scores are just not moving).<br/>
<br/>
<b>If you are a game designer, or have inklings to be, how many of the books that you bought did you buy because you consider them interesting or good design influences? </b><br/>
<br/>
I'm not a game designer, but I do like to read and play games as tools to improve certain aspects of role-play or campaign design.  Playing Capes, PTA, Dogs in the Vineyard, Burning Empires, and even octaNe (the one I liked best of the bunch) this year was all for the sake of experimentation.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Does the number of games you own compared to the number of games you actually play bother you? </b><br/>
<br/>
Only because I feel like such a consumer.  But I do read them cover-to-cover; I buy a lot of books used or in PDF only; I try to encourage small press publishers; and I figure it's actually less expensive than some other hobbies I've had.<br/>
<br/>
<b>What keeps you from playing more games you wish to play? Is it a stubborn or reluctant group? Not enough time? </b><br/>
<br/>
It can be difficult to find players for long-running series of some off-beat games.  Even the short-run and one-off games, which we usually run at our gaming club's weekly meetings, can be challenging: for example, I heard no enthusiasm when I talked about Cat, Faery's Tale, or Trollbabe.  People were more interested in sci-fi or sword-and-sorcery settings.  And of course time is <b>always</b> a factor.  Even so, thanks to the gaming club I get to try a lot more games than I would otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
<b>And finally, how to better market games:</b><br/>
My recommendations for getting more people to play: first, put in the effort to organize a club -- and then the additional effort of keeping it alive after that.  That lets you reach the ready market of RP gamers that would otherwise not try your games.  Then try to market your book like any other book: contact bookstores and highschools in your area to organize meet-and-greets with the author (you), run demo games at sci-fi or comic cons and (non-RPG) game day events, etc.  That gives you a chance to get in touch with new potential markets.                        </div>

That puts me in a bit of a corner if I want to try a number of games.  It looks like we may simply go with Ars Magica, which seems to meet the various player criteria I've collected so far.  The indie stuff is often brilliant, but it's out of the mainstream awareness, and it's a risk if we're going into it without either open minds or someone experienced running it.  I've jumped into running a few indie games, and there are always bits you trip over on the first run-through.  When I had an "X-games" group a few years ago, we ran through a bunch of new stuff, basically exploring.  This group isn't in that headspace, so although I'd like to play a half-dozen or so new games, I'll probably take a more conservative route for now.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I had a sudden influx of money this year due to actually finding work, and that combined with a return to rpg.net and the Forge and finding this place led to some spending. So.<br/>
<br/>
<b>How many books did you buy, say, this year?</b><br/>
<br/>
16 games purchased this year. Oh, and 13 supplements.<br/>
<br/>
<b>How many did you actually play?</b><br/>
<br/>
2, one now-aborted D&amp;D 3.0 game which I purchased no books for, and an Arcana Evolved game that just started this last Monday.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Were those actually played games really designed for short or one-off games? Or, did you devote some time to them?</b><br/>
<br/>
No, and yes and no. We met about ten times for the 3.0 game before it just kind of fell apart (what does it mean when the DM suddenly doesn't return your calls?). Too bad, because I was having fun, too. The AE thing is just starting, and the DM is handwaving a lot; we're starting at 4th level, for instance, and gaining 2 levels between each "adventure". We had so much trouble getting together the first time that it's hard to tell if we'll get through all the planned adventures or not. Only time will tell.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Does the number of games you own compared to the number of games you actually play bother you?</b><br/>
<br/>
No, not from an "I wish I hadn't spent the money if I wasn't going to use it" perspective. (I mean, hell, I still haven't played games I bought years ago like GURPS Goblins or Over the Edge.) They do bother me because they (almost) all seem like fun games I would love to play or run. I hope I'll get the chance to do that with even 1/3 of them.<br/>
<br/>
<b>What keeps you from playing more games you wish to play? Is it a stubborn or reluctant group? Not enough time?</b><br/>
<br/>
In both cases this year, I've had enthusiastic groups with lives that often interrupted things. A little frustrating, but things happen.<br/>
<br/>
But...<br/>
<br/>
I am just about to start a game of Spirit of the Century. I had the book delivered to me at work, and the pulp fans kind of came out of the woodwork. We had been playing boardgames at lunch for a few months (for me, a way to save on lunches and buy more gaming stuff), and now it seems we'll play SotC two or three times a week. We had character generation last week, and have one late joiner we're making a character for on Monday. I made a character too, because we plan to hand off GM duties, and I've already got people interested in trying out a few other things (Baron MÃ¼nchhausen, for instance). I'm also working with the FLGS to get some indie RPG demos going and perhaps even a whole RPG-night kind of thing. It's all attributable to my go-play keychain, reminding me all the time to do just that.<br/>
<br/>
We should do this again next year, and see what's changed.                        </div>
