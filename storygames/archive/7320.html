It would be really cool if you designed a game that I would feel comfortable playing.<br/><br/>Now, had I read charitably the first time I read the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7309" rel="nofollow">Jason Morningstar</a> thread, that's what I would have read. Unfortunately, I hooked into one my personal buttons, and read instead that normal games are only games that would be of interest to people who self-identify as gamers and I wrote an ugly reply.<br/><br/>But, after reading charitably, I can't help but think that what Kamil wrote is totally cool. I mean, isn't that a valid and healthy for the community desire for someone to have? To feel that a designer makes cool games and to wish that the designer would make a game that they would find accessible?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162672/#Comment_162672" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-14T14:17:33+00:00" title="August 14, 2008  2:17PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, meta thread is meeeeeeeta <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>...ok, I'll shut up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162675/#Comment_162675" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-14T14:27:36+00:00" title="August 14, 2008  2:27PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2008 2:28PM by Eric.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Admirable honest self-criticism is admirable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162681/#Comment_162681" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-14T15:13:55+00:00" title="August 14, 2008  3:13PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But if the only problem is with the games non-mechanical aspects, why not do a setting hack?

So the mechanical aspects would not work, even with a hack... Because the non-mechanical aspects and the mechanical ones are too tightly fused together.<br/><br/>For example. Gray Ranks is cool. I like how it works. But I won't want to play a game about emo adolescents, love and suffering, war and stuff. Just don't. So yes, I could hack it to be placed in the Mexican Conquest time instead of late WWII Poland. But it still would not work for me. And if I take some of the theme stuff out of it, it no longer is Gray Ranks, and no longer will work the way it is supposed to.<br/><br/>So yes, GR is cool. Yet I won't play it. At least not at this moment in my life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
