I think the text is much stronger for your feedback.<br/><br/>EDIT: And if I've missed anyone in the playtesting credits (or misspelled their name), please email me with their names at jeremy at cellar-games dot com.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334497/#Comment_334497" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T12:51:51+00:00" title="July 14, 2011 12:51PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Woo hoo!

Nice work!<br/><br/>I have a thought about attacking vs. defending in some situations. Since the defender has a big advantage mechanically (they get their full Verb rating without rolling + Push + adjectives) there are some situations that might involve a bit of "playing chicken" to see who has to make the attack roll and who gets the sweet defender position.<br/><br/>Like, let's say you're chasing me. If we both have Move 5, I'd much rather you roll to attack while I defend. My odds of success are much better. In terms of adjectives inflicted it makes sense either way. You could attack to make me <i>cornered</i> while I defend, or I could attack to make you <i>lost</i>.  Even better, if you attack first, you might expend Push dice, leaving me in an even better position to counter-attack if I choose.<br/><br/>Am I interpreting that correctly? I'm seeing a pretty big mechanical incentive to defend first rather than seize the initiative. Is that an effect you're going for?<br/><br/>(Also, we have to come to agreement about who has to do what. Do you have to succeed at inflicting <i>cornered</i> on me or I get away? Or do I have to succeed at inflicting <i>lost</i> on you in order to lose the tail? Both make sense. Who's the primary actor? Who decides?

If not, I'd love to hear about them.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>Is there a list anywhere of the major mechanical changes?

(Or if I could do so productively, ie. notice what is a change and what is not.)</blockquote>\nHere are the big things that I can think of off the top of my head:<br/><br/>\u2022 Objects themselves can be tapped with Push dice. This is because a few of the basic function tags like <i>melee</i> and <i>short range</i> have gone away. Tags now describe how the object is different from other objects in the same category. This makes many items cheaper than they were previously.<br/><br/>\u2022 I removed the 3 Push dice kill, the rules for being forced-out, and giving-in. <br/><br/>\u2022 I allow you to give henchmen adjectives like <i>unconscious</i> or <i>dead</i>, but not protagonists, heavies, or connections: you'll need to focus on more creative solutions for getting what you want rather than eliminating your enemies.<br/><br/>\u2022 There's a random chance that, after the scene is over, adjectives that describe physical damage could lead to the character gaining a sticky <i>dying</i> adjective or a locked <i>dead</i> adjective. Both can be recovered from. See the Lethal Consequences section in the Contention chapter.<br/><br/>\u2022 I've added rules for affecting multiple targets with one roll, ignoring inappropriate negative adjectives, interfering with actions against targets who aren't you, and applying adjectives without rolling when actions aren't opposed. See the Action Options section.<br/><br/>And there's several things throughout that are clarified, made more explicit, and framed better. You shouldn't need to remake characters at all\u2014just decide if you want to give them Kreds back for any tags their objects might have that have been removed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334563/#Comment_334563" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T21:35:27+00:00" title="July 14, 2011  9:35PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2011 9:35PM by Ludanto.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It might be one of those things that isn't a problem in actual play, but the fact that a PC can end up <i>dying</i> from being <i>bruised</i> (admittedly, following some bad rolls) is troubling, especially in a genre where getting beaten up and taken prisoner is supposed to be a viable, even encouraged, tactic.<br/><br/>But other than that, I really like the new document!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334567/#Comment_334567" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T21:56:59+00:00" title="July 14, 2011  9:56PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>I like the new doc a lot, Jeremy.

Whoever attacks first has the advantage of setting the narrative tone and shaping the situation. If I give you the fleeting adjective of <i>grabbed</i>, now you have to choose between using your action to remove <i>grabbed</i> or do something that still respects <i>grabbed</i> (which wouldn't be making me <i>lost</i> at that point).<br/><br/>Also, I think the mechanical advantage usually goes to the attacker as well. Base verb ratings, for your best stats, tend to hover around 3 or 4. Because it's a keep highest dice roll, once you get 4 or more dice, you can usually count on a 5 or 6. Bringing Push into play, defenders can push their reaction ratings up to 6 or higher if they save their Push for defense, but that iron defense isn't a tactic that sees much play unless someone manages to hoard 5 or more Push dice. \n<blockquote>(Also, we have to come to agreement about who has to do what.

The adjectives modify that base assumption. And then when those adjectives are removed, they return us back to that base assumption. So, if I fail at making you <i>cornered</i>, the base assumption is still in effect\u2014you're still just out of my reach. If you make me <i>lost</i>, that's when you've gotten away. I'd love to do some full start-to-finish examples of chases and other conflicts with the system, but I'm thinking that's a series of blog posts leading to a free pdf type of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334568/#Comment_334568" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T21:59:30+00:00" title="July 14, 2011  9:59PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ludanto</cite>It might be one of those things that isn't a problem in actual play, but the fact that a PC can end up<i>dying</i>from being<i>bruised</i>(admittedly, following some bad rolls) is troubling, especially in a genre where getting beaten up and taken prisoner is supposed to be a viable, even encouraged, tactic.<br/><br/>But other than that, I really like the new document!</blockquote>\nThanks!<br/><br/>Remember that <i>dying</i> is something you can recover from.

As it stands there is no way to guarantee someone's death within the contention rules -- though presumably I could shoot someone in the head in some fiction-only way if they have no ability to resist, or something of that sort.<br/><br/>I'm concerned about adopting this change for our group, because we are using the rules to run something closer to a military espionage game than a typical cyberpunk story -- and in general, when it comes to high-stakes espionage, counter-terrorism, and the like, people die a lot. It's important to be able to kill or incapacitate people quickly -- or at least, as quickly as is reasonably possible in some parallel to reality. Having to inflict four to six negative physical attributes on someone in the hope that they will then start dying -- at which point if you are the only person around you could just kill them, I assume -- seems extremely laborious. <br/><br/>It also seems gravely unsuited to any genre where someone can at any moment step out of the shadows and kill a crucial informant moments before he is about to reveal something important -- or where you might want to do the same to the man or woman who is about to betray you. Noir and cyberpunk both tend to include a lot of sudden, swift, unexpected death -- the above scenario is nearly clich\xe9 -- so I'm curious if you see that sort of action as still-present in TechNoir, and if so how you would go about implementing it in the rules? Does NPC vs. NPC murder simply happen, as suddenly as I want it to?<br/><br/>If a PC discovers that their Connection, Jamal, has betrayed them and is about to sell them out to the big corporation, and when they arrive at the scene of the info-drop they see Jamal walking up to three men in suits, about to spill his guts... maybe they want to shoot him in the back of the head? And if they do, what does that look like, mechanically? I would be tempted to run it as an unopposed skill roll that simply results in Jamal's death, but that seems incredibly easy.<br/><br/>And what if instead they confront Jamal before he gets there, but their words fall on deaf ears, and so after some arguing back and forth they decide that the only solution is to kill Jamal, here and now, before he sells them out. Do they really have to stand there and shoot him for six to twelve subsequent rounds of contention, then wait and make sure he rolled at least one 6 and nobody is coming to help him out? Jamal is just a shopkeeper, and they're a bad-ass with a flechette gun -- surely they hold his life in their hands, in some more direct way than that? Should the GM simply employ fiat to determine that the PC can kill him easily, or what?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335009/#Comment_335009" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T06:35:03+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  6:35AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that removing three push kills is a bad thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335017/#Comment_335017" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T07:24:53+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  7:24AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if the new Lethal Consequences applied to PCs and you could actually apply a "dying" locked adjective to NPCs?
