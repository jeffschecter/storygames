The bounty hunter is a necessary evil and their righteous wrongs hold the unjust accountable. <br/><br/>Outline:<br/>The player's were hired to track down Astro Parker by the criminal shadow government The 5th House. After dealing with senator Skyborn they learned Astro was a low level intelligence officer who was planning to leak the governments darkest secrets and that Astro was likely headed to City 4. The hunters prepared stakeouts and searched across City4's locations eventually finding him in the catacombs. After a brief skirmish Astro is brought down, shot in the head (non-lethal rounds) and unable to free the information he felt his fellow citizens needed to know. Once again the bounty hunters are a triumph of gray morality!<br/><br/>so Joel, Chris, Mike, Tracey any feedback?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325597/#Comment_325597" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-20T23:42:03+00:00" title="May 20, 2011 11:42PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2011 11:45PM by Chris_Goodwin.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure!  <br/><br/>I played Cassandra Ceres.  Role: Rock (in a social and emotional sense), Body: Smallest (I pictured her as 4'9" and a total anime girl), and Mind: Realist (bonuses when using forethought and reason).  She acquired the Traits Socialite and Marksman, both at level 1; the Marksman Trait came with Item: Rifle with no mods.  I ended up sniping our target in the head, thanks to help via bonuses from other players.  <br/><br/>Feedback:  <br/><br/>Basics:  Everything is done with cards.  Choose Role, Body, and Mind cards, from a small set of each provided at character creation.  The various Role, Body, and Mind each provide a bonus under certain circumstances, treated very similarly to Fan Mail in Primetime Adventures.  Conflicts involve dice pools (d6), usually involving two stats with bonuses provided by traits, the action and conflict types, and other factors.  Every die that comes up 5-6 explodes, giving another die to roll, and every 5-6 continues to explode.  High number of successes wins.  The conflicts themselves are treated similarly to combat in many games; each side has an effective "hit point" value, regardless of the conflict's main arena, and when one side or the other is whittled down enough that side gives up.  <br/><br/>The awesome:  Character creation was <i>slick</i>.  The stats each card provides are down the left hand side of each card.  Place them so you can read all of the numbers, then place your character card next to them.  Add straight across to find the stat values, and viola.  Quick and easy.  In the basically two hours we played, we created characters and got most of the way through (effectively all, though I got the hint that there was some fudging to get us to that point -- it was the fault of our time constraints, let me emphasize).  When the game is up, you keep your character card, on which you've written down all of your relevant stats, and your Role, Trait, and Item cards; hand everything else back to the GM.  Next session you can get back the same cards you had.  The cards have all of the info on them you need to play; locations, NPCs, and so on, are presented by the GM on other cards.  <br/><br/>The criticisms:  <br/><br/>I thought that maybe the information on the cards was a bit too dense.  Each of the basic card types has a subset of the basic rules presented on it (all Role cards have portion X, all Body cards have portion Y, all Mind cards have portion Z).  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, though I did find myself at times wondering if there wasn't some info I was missing.  Perhaps a larger sheet with X, Y, and Z on it, with a bit more explanation of the parts, could essentially provide everything the player needs to know, and could take that info off of the basic cards, perhaps to do something extra with that real estate.  This could also have been an artifact of getting the rules explained rather than having a rulesheet or book to refer to.  Tyler, you're very good at explaining the rules, by the way.  <br/><br/>The conflicts felt a bit long to me.  It actually felt at times like we had to whittle down the baddie's hit points before we could end the conflict.  I would have liked to have see some more options, like, for instance: a success on a certain type of action means you can request a small piece of information right away.  If I had the cards to look at I could be more specific; sorry Tyler.  It kind of felt like, for instance, a "demoralize" result didn't actually result in the opponent being demoralized.  I know you were marking down the NPC's stats as we were whittling them down, but there was some repetition; he'd already Stalled us once, and successfully Stalled us again.  <br/><br/>The order of things in this game goes thusly: roll the dice, then narrate what happens.  I found it extremely hard to get my head around that, and I found myself desperately wanting some kind of basic narration to start, and then rolling to narrate the result.  That could very well be my issue rather than the game's, though.  <br/><br/>All in all I quite enjoyed it, and look forward to playing it again and seeing the finished result!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325598/#Comment_325598" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-20T23:47:18+00:00" title="May 20, 2011 11:47PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Incidentally: Tyler, I hope that that was the kind of feedback you were looking for.

What did you think about the length of the fight scene, was it too short?<br/><br/>The basic structure is interesting, as you put it "roll the dice, then narrate what happens." your the second person to struggle with it. (the first was Peter Adkison, admittedly I was much worse about explaining it back then) I'm very interested in how you were processing the scene at the table. I don't think I can "fix" this but I would like to know more about how you felt. Maybe I can come up with a better explanation. Some times simply selling a player on a structure is enough to remove the creative block that happens. <br/><br/>After trying more card layouts then I care to recount I have come to accept the information density as a necessary evil. Thanks for the specific thoughts though, i have played with the position of the basic info a number of times i'm still not quite sure where it fits. One question, what content would you want to see on the back of the body, mind, and role cards?<br/><br/>*I'm starting to think that four players and one GM is too many players to really get the most out of the challenge system, with the way stats rise and fall the game is more interesting if each character takes more turns, but the narration can drag and get repetitious with more turns. maybe letting characters opt out of a scene in a 4+ player game? It seems like players in story games dont mind sitting a scene out (watching is fun too). maybe i could reward the opt outs with an extra "player scene"<br/><br/>EDIT:oh and by the way, if you guys are interested in playing this again i'm going to be adding character Arks to the game soon and would love to test it with a group who has established characters, i dont want to take up another go play event though. maybe a different day next month.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325725/#Comment_325725" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-22T18:44:51+00:00" title="May 22, 2011  6:44PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played Mandark (named after Dexter's nemesis from <i>Dexter's Laboratory</i>), a former Imperial Military quartermaster who was drummed out of the service for wheeling-and-dealing a bit too much with official equipment for personal gain. He was big, sneaky, and good-humored.<br/><br/>Overall, I had a fairly good time with Zero Hunters. The character creation mechanics are pretty slick (though I am wondering, are there other options for Role, Body, and Mind?), and the rules, once they were explained, made a good amount of sense. I was actually pretty fond of the Roll-Then-Describe method (being used to it from other games, like octaNe), though perhaps it should allow for a little bit of description before hand, to sort of set-up the basics of the action, and then the majority of description after the roll determines how successful the character is.<br/><br/>I only had a few quibbles with how things worked. Firstly, like Chris, I thought maybe too much information was trying to be crammed on the backs of the character cards. I'd prefer a central sheet that has the maneuvers, mechanics, and maybe a short outline of how to play, and then the cards containing the abilities and special stuff that will be specific for that character.<br/>The very specific maneuvers and their effects are fine, for the most part, but I think they are a bit at odds with the otherwise very narrative-centric way the game feels. Might it be easier to have guidelines for how to turn successes into boosts, damage, etc.? For example, if someone rolls four successes vs. an opponent's ability of 2, they'd have two points to spend on boosting his own ability, or lowering the opponent's ability, or inflicting damage, or a combination of the three.<br/><br/>But other than that, I liked this very much, and look forward to giving it another shot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325771/#Comment_325771" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-22T23:51:22+00:00" title="May 22, 2011 11:51PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks very much for the feedback!<br/><br/>At the moment the Role, Body, Mind cards are the only ones available.

I think it will shorten the scenes and really make the high rolls feel good. <br/><br/>The specific maneuvers and effects are an attempt to provide something more then a Pass/Fail feedback from the system. I wanted something that could inspire narration where a player may otherwise draw a blank.

Are there just four for each? Or are there more?<br/>Like, I'm thinking some Roles that would fit would possibly be Rival, Love Interest, or maybe Traitor.<br/>That, and maybe Body could be less actually Body size and shape, and more a description of fitness and activeness? Like the one I had (Biggest), could've been Lazy, and Chris' Smallest could've been described as...I don't know...Lithe? or Spunky?
