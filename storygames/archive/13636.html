Sometimes I forget not-particularly funny sarcastic remarks translate even less well when written than when said over a gaming table.<br/><br/>I missed the sarcasm too and thought to myself, "What <i>do</i> I have to learn from this?"<br/><br/>It's funny.  It's viral.  It only takes a few minutes of your time.   I'm glad I "played" it.  Back when I worked at Treyarch we used to joke "Man, all players want these days is to press the 'you win' button."  Here's a game that actually did that, and on its own terms is fantastically successful...it probably has had millions of players.  The subtext as I see it:  games are becoming un-lose-able.  They're increasingly dumbed down (aka "made accessible") over time.  Here's the logical conclusion to that, and yet - strangely compelling.  If I was the sort to vote for games on Kongregate I'd have given it 5 stars too - in fact, there are only a few games on Kongregate I enjoyed more.<br/><br/>What would happen if we took the simplest, fastest-playing story game and made it even simpler and faster?  We might sell more copies!  But in the process, create a game that we, the hard-core, don't want to play...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308287/#Comment_308287" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T15:56:47+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  3:56PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I saw it as a parody of video games in general.<br/><br/>You just click on buttons over and over and "accomplish" things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308290/#Comment_308290" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T16:13:35+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  4:13PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have been tempted in the past to cynically set out to create a game (fantasy, obviously) that would sell millions of copies and be hugely popular, by making it an endless parade of killing things and taking their stuff, with no real way to 'lose', you'd just get less treasure and XP, causing you to level up at a slightly reduced rate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I cheer up and play a nice story game with my friends. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308313/#Comment_308313" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T18:15:57+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  6:15PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, in the ending credits they reference not only modern videogames in general, but one in particular, namely God of War.

Now, you might not have intended it to come across this way, but when I read that I get a "Fuck you casual gamer(s), you're ruining everything."<br/><br/>And when you say "...we, the hard-core...", who exactly is that? People that buy small press/indy games in the first place? People that go online and talk about this stuff? Designers? People that play more than 1 game a week? People that play more than 15 hours a week?<br/><br/>At the end of the day, it seems to me that the whole thing about making a game is figuring out who your audience is in the first place, just like any piece of writing. Blaming the audience for not being interested in _your_ product is... well, it happens, but doesn't make sense to me. Sure, be frustrated because other folks don't groove on your idea and all, but... *shrug*<br/><br/>MMOs are a well established part of the game landscape and I still see people bitching about how "WoW destroyed my game group!!1!1!1". It never seems to occur to these people that WoW is actually not the problem, WoW is actually (finally) delivering on a gameplay experience that the consumer wanted but wasn't able to get; they settled for PnP rpgs until the MMO came along that met their needs better.<br/><br/>The Wii popped out and there was all kinds of angst about how videogames were being dumbed down and the market for the "hardcore gamer" was going to be destroyed; humourously a nice chunk of these complaints were coming from console folks, who are already responsible for the "dumbing down" of videogames in the opinion of many PC gamers. Elder Scrolls: Oblivion was one of the games cited by PC gamers as being "dumbed down" because of the console market.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm not so sure the "hardcore" market of rpgs needs to be catered to more than they already are. They're the ones that drive hardback sales, the requirement for mainstream rpg books to be half coffee-table art book half physics manuals. They're the completionists and collectors, they're a major (but not only) part of forum communities, and designers are frequently courting them and making changes to product based on their feedback.<br/><br/>What are the sources of the casual person? It's a lot more fuzzy. How do you actually _get_ the casual person? That's pretty fuzzy too; it's also what lots of people are trying to figure out because they've started to realise that there's a much larger "casual" crowd than there is a "hardcore" crowd. Especially since most people have to start somewhere, meaning they're classed as "casual" since they're not _actually_ involved when they're being introduced.<br/><br/>For example, my wife introduced 3 people to rpgs. While I don't consider myself a "hardcore gamer" or even a "gamer", she's definitely in the "casual" grouping. At an XMas party when one of the ladies suggested getting together, she turned to me and said, "Oh, are you free or do you have a game?" The others wanted to know what "game" it might be, and my wife cheerfully launched into talking about rpgs and how it's sorta like improv (2 of the ladies have theatre background), etc. 10 minutes later she'd arranged a game to introduce 3 people to rpgs, while I sat there slightly stunned.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, my wife had never GMed before, despite dabbling in rpgs for the past 20 years.<br/><br/>The system used was PDQ, which has some traditional elements to it as well as some of the more "storygame"/"hippie"/"indy"/whatever label is getting used these days. I guarantee that PDQ isn't a system to appeal to what I see as "hardcore" type gamers, those types are going to be more attracted to FATE.<br/><br/>My only role in all this has been to be a player and to respond to specific requests for assistance from my wife. As I told her, "I've been doing it more than 20 years. You and the girls have a different approach to things and I don't want to poop on that with my 'this is the way we do it' or whatever. I'm happy to tell you where you might have some problems mechanically with the system, but unless you're trying to do something that's going to lead to an opposite result, I'm keeping my mouth shut. It's your group, it's your game, you ladies just need to figure out the stories you want to tell."<br/><br/>So, 3 new people have started messing around with rpgs, led by a "casual" type rpg player, using a "dumbed down" (more accessable) system. This is a bad thing?<br/><br/>I think games should probably come with that "level selector". Not "beginner" and "advanced". No, I think the "easy", "hard", or "casual", "hardcore" type labels. Of course, part of that is just a semantical thing and my gut is that "easy" or "casual" feels... better? nicer?... than "beginner". Maybe part of it is because my experience is that while people might describe themselves as "beginner" in stuff, often they don't like being classed/labelled as such; a topic for a different discussion though.<br/><br/>But level selector for games? Oh yeah. It explicitly lets folks know that there's different approaches, it lets them know that "casual" or beginner types don't have to worry so much, etc.<br/><br/>Does Best Friends count as one of these dumbed-down games? 3:16? If a game is selling more, but "hardcore" people aren't the ones buying it, is that actually a problem?<br/><br/>Sorry for the long post, but like I said... I'm feeling stupid here and not actually understanding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308474/#Comment_308474" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-16T21:30:02+00:00" title="January 16, 2011  9:30PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2011 9:30PM by whiteknife.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, I think you're right. Definitely, I think that if a game were in include some sort of "complexity levels" concept ("difficulty levels" is of course the video game term, but that doesn't really make much sense when you port it over to an rpg), that they shouldn't be labelled "beginner" "advanced" etc. <br/><br/>Personally, I like the label "casual", because while it implies that "hey this is easier", it doesn't (well, to most people) also imply you're less skilled, just that you don't want as involved an experience. By comparison, the only tabletop games I've seen that have used such a thing have been ones to call such products "intro" "beginner" etc. Now, of course, the reason for this is because they don't <i>want</i> you to stick with that version. When you get the exalted quick start, they <i>want</i> you to go "well this game looks cool, let's ditch these simple rules and go buy the <b>real</b> game." And really, that's a shame because I believe that a game like Exalted could have massively benefited from a less complex rule set at least being presented as an option.<br/><br/>You see something like this in D&amp;D too. You've got the red box, which is billed as something of a beginner product, and it's certainly not the full game because it only goes up to a certain level (3rd level if I recall correctly). Again, this is because all wizards other products are marketed towards the normal rule set. Well, at least they were. I think D&amp;D essentials is actually a great example of this idea in motion. You've got your standard D&amp;D for the more "hardcore" and "established" crowd, and then you've got essentials for the more casual crowd.<br/><br/>What I would really like to see though, is not just "complexity" as the dial that's being turned, but play style as well. If the "how would you re-spin D&amp;D" thread has said anything, it's that people don't all see D&amp;D the same way, and I'm sure that's true with the majority of games. I'd like to be able to crack open a D&amp;D book and choose between "simulation-focused world exploring track-your-rations-and-arrow-consumption" mode, "let's have tactical fights in a dungeon" mode and "let's tell an epic fantasy story" mode, with different rules to support each. Of course, video games can't let you flip a setting and change that much, but it'd be pretty easy to do in a tabletop game, I think. Easier than having three totally separate games anyways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308542/#Comment_308542" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-17T10:18:12+00:00" title="January 17, 2011 10:18AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2011 10:46AM by jdfristrom.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            C. S. - maybe "dumbed down" was a bad choice of words.  See, I'm conflicted about this whole thing.  On one hand, I do feel like 'dumbing down' a game usually makes it more accessible at the same time as it alienates me - I appreciate that my dad likes to play bowling on the Wii now, but I sure don't - the last videogame I really liked was Limbo on the xbox.<br/><br/>Anyhow, I really do believe I had something to learn from PSTW - my hypothetical question - what if we made the simplest story game?<br/>It might end up something like this - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gamewright-318-Rorys-Story-Cubes/dp/B003EIK136/ref=pd_ts_t_39?ie=UTF8&amp;s=toys-and-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/Gamewright-318-Rorys-Story-Cubes/dp/B003EIK136/ref=pd_ts_t_39?ie=UTF8&amp;s=toys-and-games</a> - currently ranked  the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2339&amp;Mode=like">#39</a> game on Amazon.com, well well above D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Could Story Cubes be a gateway drug to Fiasco, Shock, Geiger Counter, In a Wicked Age, etc...?  That would be awesome.  And if not, we should come up with a story game that *is* a gateway drug. In fact, since I started this thread, I've been mulling it over, and I've even written a draft of something I think could be that game.<br/><br/>That said, I don't particularly want to play Story Cubes, because I'm pretty sure it's not going to deliver the intensity and involvement I want.   Ditto with the thing I've come up with - I'd rather play any of the above games, if I can find the people to do it.<br/><br/>And FWIW, I'm not that hardcore - I'd rather play PDQ than D&amp;D myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308548/#Comment_308548" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-17T11:05:49+00:00" title="January 17, 2011 11:05AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a very casual group. It's true that their goals and priorities are very, VERY different from those who get more involved in the game. I like it because it gives me the freedom to be a strong "creative director" of the group, they're willing to go along and give more or less anything a shot. I think there's a lot more to discuss here. (I don't think the original post or the "game" really was talking about this though.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
