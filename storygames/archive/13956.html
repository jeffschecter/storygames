If you wanted to make this accessible to people who hadn't already roleplayed one or more Cthulhu games, I'd ask you to tell people that this was a roleplaying game, what type of roleplaying game, and what the setting is. I'd ask you to add specific techniques to make things tense and scary.<br/><br/>In general, I'd ask you to elaborate on some things to make it more clear what vision you have for the play experience. For instance:<br/><br/>"Describe your Investigator." - how? In psychological depth? From the outside, like a character in a fiction? What sort of traits will make the game fun for everyone?<br/><br/>But in all honesty, I'd say that for the specific function you're after - providing an alternate system to people who already know how to play this specific genre - there's not much to add or change. You even leave play style and central questions as an exercise for the reader, at the end. That's a conscious design choice, so not much to comment on for me as an editor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316257/#Comment_316257" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-11T05:10:03+00:00" title="March 11, 2011  5:10AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First and most obviously, an editor helps you adhere to a particular style, and catches mistakes where your writing has violated that style. Essentially I mean proofreading, and while I know you're a very good writer, I'd be surprised if you'd never had someone point out a misspelling or typo in your printed book. <br/><br/>More importantly, however, an editor's job is to question your assumptions and help you see your text as your readers will see the text, so that you can be sure of your message. If you are writing a book for an American audience, it may be that using American spellings and turns of phrase would be best, but that might not occur to you in the course of writing. Or, as Matthijs pointed out, you might just assume people understand your ideas without explanation (i.e. "step 2: role-play!"). <br/><br/>When I have time, I'll take a closer look at Cthulhu Dark and some of your other stuff to look for specifics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316258/#Comment_316258" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-11T05:27:12+00:00" title="March 11, 2011  5:27AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I looked at the game. Your writing style seems plain and straight forward. It mainly deals with dice rolling proceedures. You have few verbal flourishes. I have a very similar writing style.<br/><br/>The problem with this style is that it can come across as too abrupt. It can seem choppy and have no flow. This impedes people reading it or taking in the information. I try to put the poetry back in in the re-writing stage. <br/><br/>As far as the game goes it looks fun. I like the sanity rules - I want to see my players buring books - MUST HIDE THE TRUTH!!!<br/><br/>I just finished a play test of a Trail of Cthulhu scenario and love how it uses stability checks and drives to pull the players further into the terror. <br/><br/>So with your game - I'd say try doing re-write with poetry in mind - read it outloud to see how it flows - but keep your simple style.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316263/#Comment_316263" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-11T06:43:01+00:00" title="March 11, 2011  6:43AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldn't edit a postcard without getting paid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316269/#Comment_316269" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-11T07:32:16+00:00" title="March 11, 2011  7:32AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think Graham is fishing for free editing here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316271/#Comment_316271" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-11T07:36:58+00:00" title="March 11, 2011  7:36AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another important thing: Asking stupid questions.

I'd elaborate a bit and say "If when you both roll, you get the higher die, you succeed normally, but if they get the higher die then you are caught."<br/><br/>So in general what an editor would catch is where you know what you mean, but a reader is forced to do some thinking to figure it out. These types of situations is where errata would be necessary, or you need to ask for a ruling because a situation could go multiple ways. Cthulhu Dark is simple enough that it's probably not necessary to ask for a ruling, some thinking about it will be sufficient, but it's better if you don't need to do that at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316277/#Comment_316277" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-11T08:42:13+00:00" title="March 11, 2011  8:42AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2011 8:48AM by DanMaruschak.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not a professional editor, but the first thing I'd do would be to confirm the assumption that your target audience is people who are familiar with other Cthulhu investigative games and already know to an extent "how to play" and "how to be a keeper". If that was the case, I'd ask you how you wanted people who didn't fall into that target market to respond to your text. Should they be able to figure out it's not for them? I'm not sure they could do that easily. (One possible solution would be to include something like "for experienced Cthulhu roleplayers" in the subtitle, so people could more easily self-select, but there are downsides to that.)<br/><br/>At a lower level, I'd point out in your Doing Things section that it's not immediately obvious that the bullet points are additive and form a dice pool. Someone could easily interpret the bullet points as independent options for completing the opening sentence. I'd suggest amending the words before the bullet points to better indicate that you're building a pool of dice.<br/><br/>I'd also say that I found the Rerolling section much harder to parse than the rest of the text. The complicated "if" clause that opens it is probably the biggest barrier, since sentences like that can be hard to consume. I'd suggest reworking the section to ease people into the "rolling your insanity die lets you do rerolls" concept more smoothly. I might propose alternate wording, depending on whether that was the sort of thing you wanted from an editor.<br/><br/>I'd also expect the hypothetical editing process to be iterative, and that I'd spend more time and attention on it than I just did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316279/#Comment_316279" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-11T08:43:57+00:00" title="March 11, 2011  8:43AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like you're main goal is to provide as much information as possible as simply as possible in as little space as possible.<br/><br/>With that in mind, I would question the suggestion that you elaborate more, particularly on points tangential to the rules of the game.<br/><br/>A few things I would change:<br/><br/>I would eliminate the "Other Clarifications" section and move each clarification into the most appropriate section. For example, I would move the second clarification into the "Doing Things" section, after you mention the different dice used.<br/><br/>Talk of the Keeper arrives very late in the game, and totally caught me off guard, hidden in the "Unanswered Questions" section. I would add a brief "Keeper" section to the first page and move the explanation text from "Unanswered Questions" there. In fact, that would let you remove the "Unanswered Questions" section and its first paragraph entirely, decreasing the length of the game or creating room for clarification of other points.<br/><br/>There are other small, sentence level changes that I might make, but it'd be awkward to detail these in a message board post.

The short answer is: it depends what you want. A good editor can work with a text at many different levels, often several simultaneously.<br/><br/>Lowest level: catching typos, errors of spelling, grammar, punctuation, etc. You consistently misspell R'lyeh, for example. And your use of a double S in focusses is acceptable, but relatively unusual compared to focuses. You sometimes use colons in a way I wouldn't, e.g. in "Thus, in the example above: even if you rolled a 6 while searching your great-uncle\u2019s personal effects, you would not find the coordinates of Ry\u2019leh, where Cthulhu sleeps." This is perhaps not downright wrong, but I see no reason why a comma wouldn't be simpler and better. I'm happier with the one in Roger's example, and I don't like his suggestion of a semi-colon much. A dash would be OK, but they get out of hand quickly if you start using them for everything, so beware.<br/><br/>Next level: consistency, stylistic conventions. Ensuring that dates are always cited the same way (yours are), that a spelling convention is followed consistently, that initials are consistently punctuated, lots of trifling stuff like that.<br/><br/>Next level: is the text comprehensible and unambiguous *to its intended audience*? I would say broadly yes here, although readers unfamiliar with RPGs might well be confused by the use of "you" to mean both the player and the character. That's probably OK with you, but it's the kind of issue an editor might raise. As the author, you know what a sentence means even before you write it. The editor has the advantage of seeing it for the first time as it is, not as you meant it to be.<br/><br/>Next up: can the writing style be improved? We're getting more subjective here, but I spend a lot of time taking out extraneous words and finding simpler, clearer ways to say things. Plain English is not every writer's goal, however, so here editor and writer need to arrive at an understanding. Generally I think your style is admirably spare. I might be able to think of a few improvements here and there given time.<br/><br/>Lastly, perhaps, can the text be better organised? Would it be useful to move big chunks around, or break the subject down in a different way? Again, this is horses for courses, and depends greatly on the intended audience and their level of knowledge.<br/><br/>Hope this is helpful. There's probably more stuff we do that I haven't thought of, but most days I just improve texts in any way I can, in the time available.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316368/#Comment_316368" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-12T05:15:29+00:00" title="March 12, 2011  5:15AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was a textbook editor for seven years.<br/><br/>Cthulhu Dark requires no additional editing whatsoever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316369/#Comment_316369" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-12T05:15:34+00:00" title="March 12, 2011  5:15AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Hallett</cite>Lastly, perhaps, can the text be better organised?

I'm terribly unorganized, and I highly value this kind of professional insight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
