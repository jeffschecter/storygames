I used it when I GMed Best Friends three times at a con last weekend, and the results were really promising. Here's what I included:<br/><br/><b>A table containing Player name, Character name, Flags, Motivations and some checkboxes</b><br/>Player name is good at a con, because I'm terrible at names.<br/>Character name is self-explanatory.<br/>Under "Flags" I wrote down some stuff they said when presenting their characters (specifically the Stuff and Nonsense from Best Friends) that struck my fancy. This was really handy for when I needed to throw something fresh into the pot or looked for scene ideas.<br/>"Motivations" was a good source of hooks. All I had to do to come up with a good scene was to check the Motivations of some characters and find ways to tie them together. Also great for bang creation (set two Motivations against each other and you've got a dilemma bang) and for when I needed to tie a character into a storyline she wasn't in.<br/>The checkboxes started out at four, marked with A, I, C, A, for Activated, Involved, Centered and "Avslutad" (Closed" in Swedish). The first one was checked when the character was brought into the game, the second when she was involved in a storyline, the third when she'd been the centre of attention of a scene, and the fourth when her storyline was over. In practice, the first and the last were unnecessary, and I sorta only used the Involved and Centered boxes.<br/><br/><b>A mind map</b><br/>The mind map was used to show the interesting points of the storylines and show me who was related to what storyline. That way, I could make sure that everybody was involved, and that there wasn't several unconnected storylines, but rather a big jumble.<br/><br/><b>A list of reintegrations</b><br/>This was supposed to work as a list where I wrote down anything cool that I wanted to see again, and then check it off once I reintegrated it. In practice, I didn't use it once. I think that might have to do with the focused stories of Best Friends, though. There wasn't any need for it, really. It might be taken care of by the mind map, but I'll have to try it in other games. I think it could work well in multi-session games, too. Gonna try it out in our 3:16 campaign (yes, it seems I've been reduced to a Hutton fanboy. Dare I mention that I played two sessions of 3:16 at the con, as well? Out of six sessions played, five were Gregor's games).<br/><br/><b><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/magazine/13Psychology-t.html" rel="nofollow">The Five Moral Spheres</a></b><br/>Thanks, Selene! I knew this was golden stuff. I had a list of the five spheres (Fairness, Hurt, Community, Authority and Purity) at the top of the sheet, and it proved excellent for bang creation. Take a Motivation and put it up against some aspect of morality, or probe to see how the characters judge the different spheres. These are more or less universal motivations, and as such, a great tool to create bangs for characters that don't have that many motivations of their own.<br/><br/>So that's the stuff I put on there. This thread is only partly about spreading this tool. What I really want is for you guys to come up with other interesting stuff to put on the GM sheet, to help with managing the story. I've considered writing down the names of storylines and having some checkboxes for different phases (like conflict, escalation, climax and resolution). Might work for some games. I'd be great to have a toolbox of these things so you can make your own GM sheet for your needs in a particular game. Maybe I suck at motivating characters. It sorta takes care of itself in some games (like 3:16), but it's really important in others (like Best Friends), so I could put a tool for that on tmy GM sheet when I GM those games.<br/><br/>Hit me with your ideas, people!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175463/#Comment_175463" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-19T11:45:02+00:00" title="October 19, 2008 11:45AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No one's responded to this for some reason, but I just wanted to say it sounds like a great idea.<br/><br/>I especially like your method for creating Bangs from Motivations. I've been working on a lot of similar "formulas" lately myself.<br/><br/>I have some questions for you:<br/><br/>* What was your goal behind the four checkboxes?

I had it there to make sure that nobody was simply "following along", but rather was engaged in something important to that particular character.<br/><br/>The "Centered" checkbox was to make sure that every character had one scene or situation which was all about her. Like in the session where everyone was playing angsty goth girls, one character had a scene where she was alone with the beautiful dark gothy guy, and another character had a moment when everyone found out she liked Stephen King (which is, like, <i>mainstream</i>!) and she was the focus of the entire group.\n<blockquote>* What is a mind map? What did yours look like?</blockquote>\nI'll have to wait until later to show you how it looked. Basically, I started out with every character name spread out, and then when plot points came up, I added them and drew lines to the characters who were engaged in that particular point. So I added the "Dark goth guy" and drew a line to the character who was in love with him, and then when another character tried to steal him away, I connected her, too, with the "Dark goth guy" bubble. And I had a separate bubble for the Stephen King novel and for Wilma, the preppy friend.\n<blockquote>Finally, on the reintegration thing, it's something I've made good use of in some of my game designs.

As I said, I think I'd use the reintegration list better in another game, and even more so in a multi-session campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175510/#Comment_175510" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-20T00:30:53+00:00" title="October 20, 2008 12:30AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>* What is a mind map?

Had 7 groups a week at most. It was imperative to have a sheet in front of me with names of all the players, the characters and some key qualities of the characters. I discovered that it was THE most helpful tool for me (and partly the players) to have that sheet in the center of the table. I make such a sheet whatever rpg I'm playing now.<br/><br/>I do not use GM-screen, but I have some side-sheets too: mainly an alphabetical list of names suitable for the setting. I list two names on each letter, one male and one female, from A to Z (that is: <b>\xc5</b>, that being the last letter in the Norwegian alphabet). Maps is also a standard for me, GMing traditional rpg's, and they tend to be full of information of NPCs and inns and stuff. Normally I leave the maps open, making the information on them available for the players. It gives the players greater freedom in seeking out key NPCs in the society around them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175579/#Comment_175579" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-20T12:04:24+00:00" title="October 20, 2008 12:04PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 20, 2008 12:05PM by Simon_Pettersson.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Name lists are excellent stuff.

I've culled the tips and techniques from several years of reading the Forge and Storygame forums, as well as numerous blogs.  Currently, my major issue is editing and formatting the document so that information is sufficiently concise and available at as glance.  Attractiveness is not as yet my main concern.<br/><br/>My goal is a single, two sided sheet.  Side one is "PLAY" and is just focused on techniques when running the game.  Side two is "PREP" and is techniques used when preparing for the game.<br/><br/>It's a work in progress.  So I'm very interested in feedback, suggestions for additional tips or techniques to be included, or corrections (if something thinks the information on my sheet is inaccurate or could be improved).

I particularly like the different scene goals. That's a good thing to have in mind, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
