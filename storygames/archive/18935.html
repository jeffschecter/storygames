If you can give me any feedback or find this useful, I'll be more than glad to share it.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you don't want to read the other thread, what I've got here is a list of six double sets of open ended questions for the players, meant to help them create backgrounds for their characters that relate PCs among themselves and with PCs. I don't have all the material with me right now, so I'll see to translate it and post it later, but here's a sample of how the process works, so you have an idea.<br/><br/>1-Each player creates their PC however they like, spending points on their skills, equipment, etc.<br/><br/>2-In the Anima/Tenra hack I've done, you get to divide the amount of creation points used by two to find the age of your character. This divided by 5 is the amount of Aspects the character will have specifically for their background.<br/><br/>3-For the next steps all players need to be present. They roll to see who begins answering questions.<br/><br/>4-There are six sets, so they roll one dice to see which set they use. Each set has a positive and a negative version of each open-ended question, which are again choosed randomly by rolling a dice. For example, the positive version goes something like "How do you usually solve problems?", while the negative version is "What is the last thing you'll do to solve a problem?" <br/>These questions are actually related to the PC main stats, so you just have to check your character sheet to answer. But depending on which version you got randomly how you answer, the GM may choose to give you a positive or a negative trait.<br/><br/>5-The next question on the same set is addresed to another player, chosen by the one who answered the first qustion. Again, this player rolls to see if she gets the positive or negative version of the next question. The next positive version of the question states: "You know this person (the previous PC), he/she is (insert trait from the previous answer here) and once got you out of trouble by using (choose one of the maxed-out skills of that PC). What happened?"<br/>The negative version is "You know this person (the previous PC), and once got you in trouble because he/she is (insert trait from the previous answer here)What happened?"<br/><br/>6-The Procedure goes like this, with each player answering one version of the question and chosing the player who will answer the next, thus expanding the relationship tree. Some questions involve NPCs chosen randomly, some generate other past events where other PCs or NPCs could be present. Other have the players creating NPCs closely related to them, so in the end you're bound to have plenty of starting plot hooks for every PC, either by their own or because they will want to protect another PC or NPC, or have sworn death to another PC or NPC. Since every answer generates an Aspect, all these have mechanical influence on the system (though I'm limiting their use at three times by session each one and they only give a +1 to +3 to the dice roll or that amount of action points when invoked. The modifier depends on how important is for the character and grows as it sees further use. Players answer questions untill they meet their quota of aspects, so of course, older characters will start the game with more and younger ones will obtain more in play.<br/><br/>Ok, the idea is there, though is still kinda fuzzy, I'll try and post tomorrow a pic of the translated tables (all my material is still in spanish, sorry) along with an example.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423329/#Comment_423329" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-24T09:34:32+00:00" title="October 24, 2013  9:34AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/characterquestions_zps38f6d726.jpg"/><br/><br/>Here's the table in spanish (sorry, I didn't had enough time to translate it yet) but I'll run an actual example of what it could produce:<br/><br/>Let's say the characters are a Samurai, a Ninja, and a Summoner. The Samurai's player rolls a 5 and a 2, first number indicates the number of the question set, the second being odd indicates it has to be the negative one, which is: <i>Who or What are you searching for in (the setting place, in this case the continent of Tenra)</i>? The player wants to play a lone wolf, so she states she's just <b>looking for a good fight</b> and so the GM turns that into an aspect for her character. This set doesn't have another question linked so going around the table it's the turn of the Ninja's player.<br/><br/>The ninja rolls a 4 and a 1, so he gets to answer the negative version of question 4: <i>How do you hide who you are?</i> Quite precise for a ninja. In my hack ninjas actually pass for common people until they start using their abilities so it's more of a social character specialized in suggestion and poisons besides the enhancement pills/techniques used in the original Tenra. Player states that his character usually is acting coy but when prompted about it he'll just say something dumb and laugh like an idiot. Gm turns that into the aspect <b>Expert at playing dumb</b> Next he asks the player to choose another PC, so he points bach at the samurai, who still has aspect slots free.<br/><br/>The samurai's player gets to answer the next question of that set: <i>You have faced (previous PC) before and lost, so you decided to train (choose one of your maxed-out skills) to defeat him. What happened?</i> The samurai and the ninja's player make up together an story of how the samurai was unable to protect a merchant she was hired to escort, because the ninja poisoned her food. Now she has maxed out her perception, training herself to discern several kind of poisons by smell and sight. GM decides to give her the aspect <b>Prepared against poisoning</b> The relationship tree gets the first connection between the two players. This set of questions ends here, so it's the turn for the summoner. <br/><br/>She rolls a 4 and a 2, so it means she gets to answer the positive version of question 4: <i>You're proud of who you are. How do you show it?</i> The player says she likes to keep a demon-like creature summoned by her side. It's a bit too much but the GM likes the idea and allows it, though the summoned creature will just watch and won't do anything for her until she convinces him to act. Player goes with it and GM gives her the trait <b>A Shinigami behind me</b> for the next question on this set, the player chooses the Ninja to answer.<br/><br/>The next question is <i>You have faced (previous PC) before and won. How your (select a maxed-out skill) saved you then?</i> The summoner suggests she was also working for the merchant when the ninja attacked and her Composure saved her against the ninja's suggestion. However she hated the merchant and didn't know what else the ninja had under his sleeve, so she went with it and made it look as if she was under the influence of the ninja's psychic ability. GM gives her the Aspect <b>Ninja mind tricks won't work on me</b> (mechanically it works as a bonus to resist mind tricks, but it isn't like the character is inmmune to them). Now there's another couple of lines in the relationship tree: the samurai and the summoner worked together and faced the ninja before, but the summoner doesn't have anything against him.<br/><br/>Players keep rolling the dice and answering questions until they fill their aspect slots quota (limited by their age, as I posted previously). Some questions also create links with NPCs on the relationship tree, but on the end I think there will be enough space left for the GM to fill with a plot of their own. <br/>I think that's it. Any questions or possible problems you find on this procedure?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
