We're not video game designers or movie directors, and, unless you're working with miniatures, our visual tools for illustrating what's occurring are very few (even with miniatures, the visual vocabulary is still pretty limited). I can say, "I pull off a butterfly kick that lands on the top of his head and tips him backwards into the vat of acid," but that takes WAY longer to say than it does to watch on a movie screen, which robs roleplaying fights of a lot of the pacing and clarity that I mentioned earlier. Also, since the moves in a roleplaying fight are generally described on the spot, not prepared beforehand, it can be hard to pull that crazy ultra-awesome kick description out of your brain. You can see it in your head, but can you describe it like a brutal poet on command? Probably not consistently. (Also, I hereby declare my copyright on "Brutal Poet" as the name of a future fight game). Unless we can figure out a way to develop a verbal vocabulary of fight, one that's not an imperfect rendering of the pictures in our heads, then descriptions of fights will always be a pale imitation of the visual media we wish we were partaking in.</blockquote>\nTo which I responded:\n<blockquote>I also find that with pacing and clarity you can sometimes have one without the other, or that both are on a sliding scale.<br/><br/>Like, I often focus on graphic novel description for action scenes -- where you have an image or two that stand for the whole of a fight. This can literally be an image or two, with everything between filled in by the "viewer" in the same way you do as in a novel, or by simply focusing on a couple of points in the action. (Like, "so he knocks him down and then chases him across the apartment, stomping and crushing through glass and the wooden table, while I'm grabbing shit left and right, trying to throw it at him to give me long enough to get back on my feet" -- that could be two or three minutes on the screen, with lots of actions, but I'm just focused on the knocked down, get up again, with everything else more eluded to than described.)<br/><br/>In those situations you can have pace, but you don't always have the clarity. The more clarity you add, often, the more you slow down.<br/><br/>Personally, however, I don't always have a problem with that. I'd rather make sure everyone sees a few of the same images and results, and let them all make up their own vision of what happens between those key points (graphic novel reading style, again) than make sure everyone sees every blow and counter point by point the same. In a movie we all see the same thing (more or less), in a play less so. In a game, why worry so much about every specific?</blockquote>\nAnd then Ryan added:\n<blockquote>One of the techniques I've been working to develop has a similar vibe, only I think I'm being explicit about it. I work to make everyone break up the action like so: [what they do] [roll] [effect they have]<br/><br/>Or, to use Jonathan's example:<br/>Player: I pull off a butterfly kick that lands on top of his head<br/>[Roll dice]<br/>Player: And tip him backards into the vat of acid.<br/><br/>I didn't really realize it before, but that follow's Brand's idea of focusing on things as an image or two (specifically two). With the break-up, the pacing does seem to flow much, much better.<br/><br/>It occurs to me that I didn't unpack my thought. (I apologize for shotgunning it today -- doing a few things at once).<br/><br/>In the above situation, I'm not treating the roll as a piece of random information. Yes, that's what it's doing, but it's not why I'm really wanting to use it.<br/><br/>Have you heard a really good public speaker or storyteller speak? Said speaker knows how to say things well, and part of that is knowing when to use a pause. That is the more powerful piece of making that roll -- at points in our narrative of this fight, we shut up for a moment and let that silence (or the claking of dice) fill the room. It's the negative space in our story that makes the moments feel a bit more vibrant.<br/><br/>That's why I like breaking up the action like that. The fortune is a bonus to me, not the reason for it. (Specific to Mythender: the rolling isn't task resolution -- you're going to be successful. It's more of a pacing mechanic on said success.)</blockquote>\nAnd then Ryan and I had this fast back and forth: \n<blockquote>That's part of what I'm talking about with graphic novel framing. See, in a graphic novel/comic book the gutter between the frames is just as important as the frames themselves. What happens in one still frame becomes what happens in the next still frame, and that gutter is where the action happens, where you build your understanding of the work. (If you already know this, sorry for stating the obvious. If anyone doesn't and wants to know more, I HIGHLY recommend Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art by Scott McCloud. Hell, I recommend it anyway as a lot of the stuff he talks about with detail levels, projection, and avatar issues in comics ports almost 1 to 1 to RPGs.)<br/><br/>I find that when you think of it that way, putting the dice roll in the gutter makes perfect sense. And while it doesn't fit to movie pacing, it does fit to graphic novel pacing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><br/>Heh, I almost included "or the negative space between panels" in my list of examples thinking about your post, so I definitely get you. I think in terms of speaking, though, both as a podcaster and as someone who engages folks verbally in RPGs, hence my focus on "the pause."</blockquote>\n<blockquote><br/>See, I thought you might. Seemed worth saying anyway.<br/><br/>But either way, yes, putting the dice in the pause, in the gutter, in the place in the novel where the author doesn't tell you exactly what is going to happen next seems a good way to go.<br/><br/>However, I'm no longer sure what this has to do with the OP. Perhaps we should split?</blockquote>\nSo it occurs to me that one of the problems I often have playing a game, just about any game be it story, trad, new trad, old indie, whatthefuckever, where dice and narration get mixed up that I often will hit a point where someone is yelling "roll the dice, roll the dice!" and I'm like 'Not fucking yet, jesus christ!" or where someone else is going on while I'm yelling "roll the dice, roll the dice!" <br/><br/>I think one of the many, many things that causes this is the understanding in a game of where the gutter, the pause, or the gap is. Where is it that we are going to roll dice to determine what happens, or what that which happens means, and how is that going to effect the pacing and meaning of the game? <br/><br/>Like, in Poisoned it is possible for me to knock someone down and murder them to gain advantage. In that game, I don't have to roll for the murdering of them, I have to roll for the advantage. So the gap isn't between going to hit them and hitting them (as it would be in, say D&amp;D), or between hitting them and killing them (as it might be in a game with a different IIEE), it is between where they die and we find out how that death changes the relations of everyone else to me. <br/><br/>Now, obviously part of this is an IIEE thing. But I think it also has other issues. Like, not just about where the gap is, but about how where the gap is effects the pace of the game. <br/><br/>I'm rambling now. Let me know what you all think.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131389/#Comment_131389" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T15:41:47+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  3:41PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should break out your McCloud again.

McCloud goes into a lot of detail about this, about how the size of the panel, the size of the gutter between, the composition of panels next to each other, and all of that tells us things like how much time has passed, how much action has happened, how much emotionality or meaning we're supposed to read into a moment, and so on. <br/><br/>I've been looking for examples to illustrate this, but so far have found few that are good. The images online are rarely full pages, and those that are often show startlingly bad composition. However, I'm going to try a little bit with this set:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.nikohenrichon.com/comics/fantastico01_72.jpg"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.nikohenrichon.com/comics/fantastico02_72.jpg"/><br/><br/>Okay, so on the first page we've got a long, thin frame that shows us a widescale moment -- probably some time and space are passing in that top frame. We can sort of see the fact that the characters are moving through the world, and probably have been at this for more than just a second or two. The second frame, which overlaps with the first heavily, indicates that it is a zoom in shot -- like this is happening within seconds of the top frame, and probably somewhat overlapping in time with it. The two pannels together work to give a sense of time, motion, and detail. There is also a way in which the second frame exists just to show how very neat and cool our heroes are, zooming in on their highly unusual appearance. <br/><br/>Then on the second page we get into actual resolution mode. We get a short, close frame of the girl's face as she concentrates for the shot that is going to count. There is then a second frame in which the chasing dude is now blown out of his saddle and falling. We don't see the arrow flying here, we don't actually see the moment of impact (he's leaning back there, having already dropped his crossobow and on his way to falling). Nor do we actually see him fall or die. But in the next line down (a line break in this case being a bigger gutter than the thin white stripe indicates, though I'd have liked the composition to stretch that just a little) the girl and her mount aren't in a fight anymore, so we know its over. <br/><br/>That action, the loose, the flight of the arrow, the arrow hitting or not, the guy dying or not, happen in the gutter. Which is to say, they happen in our mind as we construct a narrative of what is happening between the still pictures. <br/><br/>McCloud also talks about how this scene could have been changed by a different use of space, guttering, and number of pannels. Like, if there had been a panel for each of the steps I listed above (aim, loose, flight, hitting arrow, guy being hurt, guy falling, guy dying) it could well have given the whole process a much tenser or weightier feel, as we see a brutal process of death being delivered. Or, if in the moment the guy got hit there had been a series of pannels close together, perhaps with a diagonal border, where we see him, see the sky, see a bird in flight, see the girl turn her face away, see him fall, and then the bird fly away, it would have given a yet again different emotional quality to the death. And if we'd had one long panel showing, with action lines for example, her shooting, hitting and killing him all in one panel it would emphasize the unity of killer and killed, where as the structure as stands makes the death less important, less directly touching her. <br/><br/>As it was we get some fast action, a sense that our hero is cool, get to see her off a bad guy we don't care about, and then go to sniff flowers afterwards. <br/><br/>Oh, and in the flower sniffing scene, note the passage of time and interconnecteness suggested by the size of the pannels, the way the green foliage links together across the pannels, the overlap of one small detail with two larger pannels, and the feeling of contemplation (hero with back to pannel) giving way to joy in life (hero smiling and tumbled in clover) that move around the petal. <br/><br/>I mean, the composition here isn't perfect, and my interpretation is clearly subjective and subject to revision, but because of the way the pannels are laid out, we get a sense of narrative, timing, pacing, and structure even without any words or any context for the action of the pannels other than the context of panel, gutter, and heroic tradition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131756/#Comment_131756" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T15:15:43+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  3:15PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 29, 2008 3:19PM by Brand_Robins.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now, as to dice -- the question I'd ask, is where in that sequence are you gonna roll? <br/><br/>To me, it looks like there is a roll, or a moment of narrative transition or whatever, around the first two pannels on the second page.

Moment-to-moment?  Action-to-action?  Subject-to-subject?  I find the distinction confusing in the wikibook, since all three seem to fit here.  Which is the relevant one?  Is there even one?<br/><br/>In any case, here's the idea:  every time you get an action, you get a panel.  You get to say what you're doing in that panel.  Then you roll, and depending on that roll, you either (a) build up dice or (b) spend to get a second panel, where you get to say the effect it has.<br/><br/>Here's an illustration of my idea, in a panel format.  There are two PC knights &amp; an NPC dragon.<br/><br/>Panel 1:  [PC #1] PC <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> charges, sword raised in the air. [Rolls some dice -- say, he rolls three dice and needs a 15.  He doesn't make it, so instead of narrating panel 2, he gets another die to hold on to.]<br/>Panel 2:  [Now PC <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is done, time for PC #2]  PC <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> jumps on top of the dragon, grappling its horns.  [Rolls 3 dice, gets a 17!  Good enough for a second panel.]<br/>Panel 3:  [Still PC #2]  The horns are ripped off!  The dragon roars in pain!<br/>Panel 4:  [NPC]  The dragon releases a mighty gout of flame at the charging knight.  [Rolls 3 dice, gets a 6.  No second panel.  Edit: forgot to add that the dragon gets an extra die here, like the PC did in Panel 1]<br/>Panel 5:  PC <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> thrusts his lance through the still-flaming mouth of the dragon.  [Rolls 4 dice, gets just on 15.  Second panel!  Not only that, we'll say this dragon had two panel-HP, so he's out of the action now.]<br/>Panel 6:  [Still PC #1]  Big panel where the dragon's now-lifeless body lay on the earth, soaking it on fiery blood.<br/><br/>So, first, does this work?  I don't mean from a mechanical standpoint -- it's just an abstraction.  Does this work within the model being described?  Second, what exactly is happening with these dice rolls?  Which break are they serving, if any?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131819/#Comment_131819" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T19:24:19+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  7:24PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>What would our shooting-being shot paid be?

It doesn't always do things clearly cause it doesn't have the full text, nor the examples that go with it.) <br/><br/>On page one we've got two frames, and between them our transition is probably moment to moment. That's not totally common in American comics, but the thing is I think it fits. Really, the second larger shot is a reframe of the first shot a second later and closer up. Its the same subject in adjacent instants, you don't have to do a lot of closure because the two things to together like two frames on a movie screen. <br/><br/>Between page one and page two we've got action to action, and then ... hmm.. .I'm gonna guess subject to subject. In the first page we've got the shot (action) and the second the aim (the next action being taken) and then the guy getting hit (transition to a new subject in the same ongoing process). To make it moment to moment you'd need more panels in between, with like, the arrow leaving the bow, the arrow shooting across the distance, the arrow hitting the guy... and so on. This type of transition takes more closure. Like, on page one you don't really need to think about what happened between panels. But someone who'd never seen a comic strip before in their life could get confused about what happens between the last panel on page one and the second on page two. <br/><br/>After the guy gets hit, we go scene to scene. Dude is being shot with arrow, and now suddenly and with no explanation we're sitting in a field of flowers with a snake tree and trying to overcome our grief. The fuck? Lots of closure there, your brain has to make up everything that happened in between, decide what it means, and integrate it into the narrative. (BTW, I find these kinds of transitions perfect for teaching people scene framing. When folks have issues with it, I have them read a comic that does a lot of this and then say "So next time, don't tell me where you are going next, tell me about the panel where you're already there and already doing something cool.") <br/><br/>The final two panels are, again, mostly action to action. They're about the girl and what she does, in the order that she does it. She sits under the tree, she smells a flower, she rolls in the clover. One subject, moving between consecutive actions, but with enough gap in between them that time could pass, and we kind of have to figure out what happened between them. <br/><br/>I'll get to the stuff about the actual game issues you bring up in a new post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131824/#Comment_131824" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T19:52:47+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  7:52PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So the thing about the panel by panel stuff you describe I like. I'm not sure how much of it ties in directly with Mc's stuff, but I'm not sure how much of it needs to. <br/><br/>Here is the thing about it that I'm thinking at the moment. Most of what you describe above is basically, if you get a second panel you get to go action to action. That is, in the process you're describing your PC is your subject. If you get a good enough roll you get a second panel in which you are doing a new action, or maybe completing an action you just took. (Action to Action. In extreme cases you could do it moment to moment, but that's more like saying "I kill him with a knife, blood splattering" and then succeeding and saying "more blood splatters" than what you're doing.) <br/><br/>When you fail, you actually go subject to subject. So your knight charges the dragon as part of the fight. You don't roll well enough to kill a bitch. So the next panel shows the other knight doing his attack (with maybe you having to dive to the side in the background?). The panel, in a novel, would show that we've switched subjects -- that the first knight did something, but that it couldn't have worked because we aren't seeing him anymore. The interesting thing about this is, depending on how you frame it, you don't even need to know why the first knight failed specifically. You know you saw him charge the dragon, sword up, and now the other guy is jumping the dragon and ripping its horns off. What happened to the first knights charge is in the gutter, and thus kinda up for interpretation/negotiation/writing off as not mattering. <br/><br/>Anyway, the successful knight then gets to go action to action, as he rolled well enough to keep the camera on him.  We then go subject to subject to the dragon. <br/><br/>At that point, I'm gonna ask why? I mean, why not let the knight keep going action to action as long as he keeps making his rolls? <br/><br/>Anyway, we go to the dragon, subject to subject as I'd said before. He blows it, doesn't get a second panel, and so we go subject to subject back to the first knight who now does well enough to get action to action, and then to another subject to subject to finish off the fight. <br/><br/>So really, in your example, what we're kind of dealing with is less pacing and more focus. The dice are acting to determine what we get to see, who gets to have effect by the fact that they stay in panel, that their action's intent caries from one panel to the next. It does, however, have some potential to do things with pacing where you don't have to focus on failures -- they just move off screen, and so you don't have to explain why the dude didn't hit the dude. <br/><br/>Also, depending on how much people describe, the pacing can be shifted around the dice. Like, how much actual real world time do you take to describe your panel? <br/><br/>For example, back to the first page of our examples. That top panel is pretty sparse -- dude on horse, girl on giant's shoulders, desert, arrow. You could describe that out in seconds. The bottom panel, otoh, is not sparse at all. Lots of detail. You could spend a couple minutes describing all that stuff, if the rest of the group wants to sit there long enough to hear it. Or maybe the whole group describes it together. So you set up this pace where you have fast description to frame, then slow description to set up. Then with the next to panels, both pretty small and very focused, you have a rapid fire resolution. Like "So the next panel is her narrowing her eye, squinting for the aim" Dice roll. "And then he's falling off his horse, crosbow flying out his hand, dead" And then next scene. So you go fast, slow, punch, punch, done. <br/><br/>Am I making sense at all?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131830/#Comment_131830" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T21:22:47+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  9:22PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 29, 2008 10:19PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>So the thing about the panel by panel stuff you describe I like.</blockquote>\nExcellent.  That's the general flow of Mythender (though, with a bit of a crunchier mechanic), and so far it's flowed well in every playtest.  I think this is the best way of explaining it I've had so far, though, as I've tried to do the "it's not like other RPGs because of X" trick and generally found myself stumbling.  Notes to talk about action in terms of graphic novels is now in my outline.\n<blockquote>The interesting thing about this is, depending on how you frame it, you don't even need to know why the first knight failed specifically.</blockquote>\nConsider this:  he didn't fail.  I don't want to sound like I'm in nutjob crazy semantic land here, and I'm sure others have said this idea more clearly than I will, but consider this: failure is the status quo in a game.  With respect to pacing, here's how I break it down:<br/><br/>Normal Failure: Nothing moves<br/>Normal Success: Small movement in a positive direction<br/>Critical Success: Big movement in a positive direction<br/>Critical Failure: Some sort of movement in a negative direction<br/><br/>So, to me, knight <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> had a success form a mechanical point of view -- he got a die for his next roll.  Knight <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> got the critical success straight away, damaging the dragon.<br/><br/>I think this brings up a neat point:  assumptions about how that gutter is filled in with your mind, and how to shape that.  When I playtest Mythender, I go to great lengths to say "there's no such thing as normal failure."  So, I filled in the gutter with a "well, the knight probably hit and just made a flesh wound, nothing to write home about, but still is some sense of progress."  So, yeah, that impact of assumption's fucking fascinating.<br/><br/>(Incidentally, my current design motto is "fuck normal failure.")\n<blockquote>Anyway, the successful knight then gets to go action to action, as he rolled well enough to keep the camera on him.  We then go subject to subject to the dragon.<br/><br/>At that point, I'm gonna ask why? I mean, why not let the knight keep going action to action as long as he keeps making his rolls?</blockquote>\nFor me, that's where I'd stop thinking about the emulated medium and start thinking about the actual one.  It's a game, and it's good to keep the spotlight moving so everyone gets in on the fun.  That said, you have a point that I'm going to chew on -- having that as a kick-ass option, like (using the example mechanic) if you rolled a 20 or spent some sort of currency, could be neat.\n<blockquote>Like, how much actual real world time do you take to describe your panel?</blockquote>\nWhich is where this gets more into my knowledge base of spoken dialog.  When I guide folks through Mythender for the first time (note: I didn't learn how to do this until four playtests ago, and I'm still struggling with the explanation -- which is why I'm loving the fuck out of this thread), I say for the first panel "describe what you're doing, but stop short of how it impacts someone else."  Sometimes it's a quick sentence when they're only looking to engage the base mechanic.  Other times it's more descriptive when they're looking to work in some of the hook-in mechanics -- getting bonus dice for scene elements someone else set up or doing a flashy move that they can limited uses of.<br/><br/>Even with that, there's a wide range of description that I see in just my home play group.  One guy will talk about how the wind whips through his hair as he jumps down from the cliff, sword drawn, onto the dragon.  Another will be pretty straightforward, with such eloquent phrases like "I lance him in the face!"  But it's fairly mitigated when the description is broken up into two (potential) segments split by a die roll.\n<blockquote>Am I making sense at all?</blockquote>\nNot only are you making sense, but you're giving me some great fucking ideas, Brand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131832/#Comment_131832" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T21:29:41+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  9:29PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 29, 2008 9:31PM by Brand_Robins.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, <br/><br/>All I have to say at this moment is I am totally down with fucking normal failure.

I have had that happen in one playtest and almost had it happen in another, because the fights ended later than they should of -- which isn't pacing from the gutter perspective, but (to continue the metaphor) a maximum/ideal pagecount perspective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
