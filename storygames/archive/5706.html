At the moment there is one player. She particularly likes exploring and discovering a coherent world - which means not taking part in the setting and situation creation.  Here is the blurb I've put together after talking to her:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are a cambridge student, in 1400's, but with a touch of the supernatural and bizzare. A normal student who fancy's themselves a bit of a detective and starts solving murders, and other crimes around cambridge. With conspiracies and secret societies, daring reoccuring allies and villians, and high status criminals and the chance to bring them down. With a noir feel, and a tad bit of swashbuckling... A girl has to know how to handle a sword, but mostly she gets by on her intellect and luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately I'm at a loss on what system to use. I'm considering a serious hack of Gumshoe - mostly running multiple parallel and nested mysteries and revising the skill list. But I'm not sure how well that'll enable the other aspects I'm looking for. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, I am looking for a few (1-2) other players in European time zones (the game will be aimed for 3 p.m. UK time on Saturdays, about twice a month) who are able to use VOIP - preferrably skype. <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your help,<br/>\n<br/>\n   - Mendel S.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127508/#Comment_127508" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T06:10:50+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  6:10AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Mendel, you could use <i>Mortal Coil</i>, slightly modified so that players neither contribute to the theme document nor set the price for magic: the GM does all that.

As such, when we play, there's definitely a sense of moving around in a pre-existing world.  The nature of <i>character</i> relationships is in flux, but the underlying world is solid.  If you were to write up a setting and say, "This is where the game happens", it should be fine.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
