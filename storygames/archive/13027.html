I was initially thinking of how to keep mechanics going so that players wouldn't have to spend more than 5-15 seconds thinking about what they do, but that got discarded quickly in brainstorming.<br/><br/>So here's the end result. You take any game, be it D&amp;D 4e, Dragon Age, Dragonlance 5th Age, A Dirty World.<br/><br/>You have either a representational battle mat with hex or square grids, or you have an abstract one which functions like Final Fantasy, where everyone lines up against the opposition.<br/><br/>Players control both the protagonists and the antagonists in battle. The only turn based aspect is protagonists one turn, antagonists the next turn.<br/><br/>Everyone just goes whenever, there's no initiative order, they move their character token to whomever they're attacking or whatever they're doing, and do it. Everyone acts simultaneously, if there's something planned, you don't have it screwed up by someone else moving before it's your turn. Things also just play out quickly. It needs some sort of mechanic where the players can determine if they hit and what the result is without having to consult with anyone else.<br/><br/>Next turn, the players control the antagonists in much the same way. If there are 3 players and 7 antagonists, then a rule that after you've acted a second time, every other player has to get their second action in before you're allowed your third would be reasonable (by this I mean a player's action is controlling a character to do something.)<br/><br/>As a result, the players know everyone's stats, and they can strategise however they like. They can make the opposition pushovers, or they can make them very nasty. The important bit is they get the battle they want. If they want to dazzle, they have stupid opposition and mow them over. If they want to fight for their victory, they have the antagonists always take advantage of weaknesses, team up, split the protagonists up, etc.<br/><br/>The referee may or may not be necessary in this situation, it's probably useful to have someone arbitrate in situations of disagreement, and also to make a decision on how much XP is given out. A Dragon Age XP system makes a lot of sense - if the battle was easy, not much XP, if the battle was challenging, either due to luck of the randomisers or because the players played the villains to the fullest extent, and they nearly TPK themselves, there's a ton of XP.<br/><br/>Obviously it's combat focused, but with an abstract layout, or potentially Diaspora's social combat setup it could work just as well for emotional interactions. It works just as well to be playing A Dirty World and land an attack by taunting a character with the revelation that you killed their parents.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293809/#Comment_293809" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T14:57:01+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  2:57PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>Everyone just goes whenever, there's no initiative order, they move their character token to whomever they're attacking or whatever they're doing, and do it.

Imagining hands poised over minis on the battle mat. Someone shouts 'GO', and a timer starts counting down (or a short-ish piece of Final Fantasy battle music starts playing) and people madly shifting minis around until the music/timer stops or things stabilize. Then some quick resolution rolls, knocking minis down (or standing them up again), then 'GO!' and the music starts again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293836/#Comment_293836" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T17:38:34+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  5:38PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            People wanting to design in this space should take a look at a wonderful little game called <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5534/light-speed" rel="nofollow">Light Speed</a>.<br/><br/>I've been waiting for years for someone to make a Light Speed-style RPG-esque game.

I don't see any real benefit to this, and it really screws with some characters.  If it's important to your character to act first, or to have 4 actions in a round where most people have 3, then this removes that detail without any real benefit.  I mean, each character in the conflict gets to act a certain number of times per round; I don't see any real advantage to saying that it happens whenever someone shouts the loudest that that's what the character does instead of in the order prescribed by the rules.<br/><br/>Two, the players determine the actions of the antagonists as well as those of their characters, and control how difficult the battle is by deciding how competent the antagonists are.  The problem with this is, at least in my experience, the players who are likely to be the most annoying when they are bored between combat rounds and who are likely to spend their downtime surfing the 'net or flipping aimlessly through the rulebook instead of considering their next action are also the ones who are likely to twist this as much as possible to their own advantage.  "Oh, the Big Bad thinks it's really warm after Joe threw the fireball, so he takes off his armor to cool down!" <br/><br/>I think if I found conflict resolution that complex to resolve, and the group wasn't interested in complexity, I'd find a different rules system altogether.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305582/#Comment_305582" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-22T11:43:06+00:00" title="December 22, 2010 11:43AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2010 11:44AM by migo.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ColinC</cite><br/>This reminds me of Sagefight.

As for multiple attacks, it's easy enough to do them all at the same time. It doesn't have to be like HERO, although admittedly it wouldn't work to well with a tick based initiative system. Not any game as I suggested in the first post, but it works with enough systems to stick to talking about the ones it would work with rather than the odd ones out that it doesn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
