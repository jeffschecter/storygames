I'm taking your recent reply to another thread to avoid further derailing <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10629&amp;page=1#Item_16" rel="nofollow">Graham's thread</a>. And, this thread is FAR too much about Nathan than it should be. It's meant to be more general. I'm not aiming to pick on you or Annalise.\n<blockquote>Hey Matt and Jason - I hear you and respect your opinions on the matter. And I speak only for myself on this, but here's why I'm publishing Annalise the way I am:<br/><br/>* I want to showcase a number of different artists in the book. I haven't been doing too well with this because of my personal slowness in getting everything together, but between Jenn, Elizabeth and a couple of other artists that I'm working with right now, there's a ton of amazing art inspired by the game, too much to fit in one book. If a potential customer is struck by one persons art over another, I would like them to be able to have that.<br/><br/>* I like giving people choices. Most people seem to buy the red cover, but I've received compliments on the white cover as well - since I can provide both through lulu at no increased cost to myself, why limit that choice?<br/><br/>* Cutesy names create atmosphere, and the production of the game is all about atmosphere. The system itself is relatively content-neutral, so I'm relying on the book itself to convey how I like the game to play without dictating a specific set of actions to players.<br/><br/>*Other than the Eternal Tears PDF edition (which I think is fairly clear that it's a PDF version of the game) and the Interim edition (which is always available through lulu), the different Edition names are for convention releases - the Seven Sins edition was a short run of hand-made books for DexCon, and the Unbidden Guests edition is what debuted at Gen Con in 2008. I think it's a more significant marker of where and when the game was released than "1st edition" "2nd edition" etc.<br/><br/>*Honestly, I'm pretty sure that the atmosphere (including cutesy titles) is part of how the audience for the game self-selects. Sure, it rubs me the wrong way when someone who doesn't understand tells someone else something about the game that isn't true, and when I see untrue statements about my game posted on the internet I feel like it's within my rights to correct them, but I guess that's what I have to deal with.<br/><br/>*Finally, none of these version are revisions, they are all the same, finished content. It's a choice of production and presentation, or depends on when and where you encounter the game, but nobody needs to buy it twice.<br/><br/>Just wanted to throw out some reasons for choosing this path.</blockquote>\nAll of the above reasons are, of course, your decision as a creator owned publisher. Therefore, anything I say is just peer-to-peer advice. It's not "Oh you suck and are doing it wrong!" Your goals might be (probably are!) incompatible with the goals informing my advice. Ok. <br/><br/>Oh! I should explain what my goals are: I am deeply unsatisfied with the level of success of Indie RPG publishing, pretty much across the board. (I count exceptions on one hand.) I think we can all do better, and I think our culture might be preventing success to some degree. I think that, at least for now, we're too focused on the art and publisher choice and ignoring customer demand. (I think that "customer" tends to be a dirty word, for example.) Broadly speaking, I think publishers in indie RPGs should shift from innovation to increasing sales/acquisitions of published games.<br/><br/>I think this for two reasons, neither of which is to poo-poo someone creating something artistic and valueable to them as a creator. I think this because the endeavor will be increasingly dissatisfying for people, and the micro-industry will hobble along when it could instead stride. OK, maybe not stride. I'll settle for amble.<br/><br/>So, Nathan, all of the your points above make <i>sense</i> to me. I get what you're trying to go in and of itself. <br/><br/>But, I think it's a bad idea. <br/><br/>You have a relatively new game. Even if you had a larger customer base (say, 1,000+ people), you would need to establish your brand. Well, your brand is Annalise. That's it. You can buy Annalise. Or you can buy the Annalise PDF. The end.<br/><br/>Why? Why establish that brand? Because of competition. We used to say there is no competition in indie RPG publishing. This is (and was) nonsense. Of course we compete. The market is absurdly small, and thus has all kinds of fucked up quirks in terms of a market. But, there's competition there.<br/><br/>So, why didn't more people buy Annalise so far? Because in the extremely short amount of time people devoted to assess your game, you confused them. They weren't sure whether it was this or that, and why are they different and so on. And, they moved on to something else to evaluate and, probably buy (and hopefully play!). <br/><br/>It's possible brand split among various titles, of course. But, doing so requires resources we don't have. It costs either time or money to explain to people that Halo 3 is slightly different than Halo 3: Anniversary Edition. (Ok, not a great example; you get the idea.)<br/><br/>Well, we don't have money, obviously. No one's marketing anything by spending any significant money in the indie RPG scene. <br/><br/>What we do have is time. And smarts. One of the best marketing techniques indie RPGs have mastered is viral marketing online and word-of-mouth among bleeding edge fans. People take this for granted. That's easy to do because it's unstoppable. If Gamer A tells Gamer B something factually wrong thing about Annalise, you can't really stop them, can you? <br/><br/>Well, by then it's too late. You should have never had that problem -- you should have better informed Gamer A.<br/><br/>And, you do that by avoiding confusion, particuarly for your new game. Person A <i>gets it</i>. They then become evangelists. That is, without paying them, you turn them into representatives for you. <br/><br/>The more we as publishers complicate that, the more we are likely to suffer.<br/><br/><br/><b>The money shot:</b> <i>The biggest problem I see among individual creator-owned publishers is that they don't appear to make good choices about what <b>not</b> to do with their games.</i><br/><br/>We don't make good, hard choices. My opinion is that we do far, far too much in the interest of experimenting and having fun and feeling cool among our known pals, and far, far too little creating <i>and selling</i> games that people actually can 1) find 2) buy and 3) play.<br/><br/>For example, should you simplify the game line, or should you release a multiple art editions that make you and the artists very pleased? Well, if you ask me, you should simplify because the customers fucking matter. You and the artists can have fun later. Do that in 3 years when you sell 1,000 copies.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235658/#Comment_235658" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-05T10:06:35+00:00" title="October  5, 2009 10:06AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, if you decide to start offering marketing services for indie designers, we're going to talk. Obviously you have great passion for making this thing of ours not only an artistic, but also a commercial success. This is good passion, and I've been known to work towards those directions myself. The interesting thing is that the more I work on my own projects (as opposed to consulting others), the more I end up doing just the sort of funky stuff you mention here. I suspect that we would benefit greatly if I did the design and you did the marketing, and possibly vice versa, so that the peculiarities of artistic vision would not mess up the marketing of the finished product.<br/><br/>This is to say that, as I wrote in the original thread, I agree with your analysis, but do not find it obvious that a designer living his passion can make the sort of impassionate choices you recommend. He would need to have more at stake in terms of popular success and less in terms of unadulterated artistic vision. As long as the latter is more important than the former, he is going to continue making decisions that only make sense within the framework of his own, personal heroquest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235662/#Comment_235662" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-05T10:18:59+00:00" title="October  5, 2009 10:18AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, <br/><br/>I think there is are a couple of splits in the community/niche/whatthefuckever between folks who want to publish for success in terms of traditional goals (sales, exposure), those who follow secondary traditional goals as their primary goals (acclaim, name recognition, status), those who are publishing under arthouse goals (artistry, self expression, boundary pushing), those who are publishing for advancement goals (pushing forward the state of the art, trying new publishing methods for novelty), and those who don't exactly know why they're publishing, they're just doing it... well, because. <br/><br/>Thing is, in an Indie scene, all of those are fine and noble goals. I'm not going to go against anyone who publishes for any of those reasons. (Well, maybe the last one....) <br/><br/>The problem that I see, that lines up with some of what you're talking about, is that folks don't make hard choices to push forward what they actually want from their publication. I see a lot of muddled ideas; a lot of folks using techniques or methods that would encourage one kind of success that actually inhibit them because they're not suitable to what the actual publishing goals are; and a lot of folks trying to have their cake and eat it too. <br/><br/>That kind of muddle doesn't help anyone. The first hard choice I think most publishers need to make is to figure out what their goals for publishing actually are. I have a bad feeling a lot of folks are skipping this step. And if you skip that one, its almost impossible to make the rest of the following hard choices on good ground. Its also hard to get good advice from the community, because unless you can explain to them what you want and why then the advice they give you may be completely unsuitable for your goals*. <br/><br/><br/><br/>*Of course, even if you do explain what and why clearly, folks will still give you bad advice because a lot of the community is muddled too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235663/#Comment_235663" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-05T10:25:24+00:00" title="October  5, 2009 10:25AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I did the design and you did the marketing</blockquote>\nThis is a very interesting point, Eero. That is, I suspect I lack the time to do someone's marketing for them currently. <br/><br/>However, your suggestion raises an interesting idea, and also highlights one of the key problems for creator-owners.<br/><br/>The interesting idea is: People arrange partnerships where one creates another markets. Or, possibly, a cooperative where individuals or teams create, and a co-op markets and sells. Very interesting indeed.<br/><br/>The problem is one I've thought about a lot over the last year. It goes like so: <br/><br/>The ethic in creator-owned RPG publishing (aka Indie RPGs, Forge games, etc. etc.) is that there is a high value and esteem based on individuals owning and being passionate about what they create. There is strong support for creator's making their own publishing descisions, owning intellectual property, conducting revisions or other material, and so on. <br/><br/>However, there is nothing in the philosophy about creator owned publishing that says the creator <i>must</i> also be the marketer (among a number of other parts of the process). <br/><br/>But, in practice, this is exactly what happens. It's a mountain of wasted (and often repeated) effort. Everyone's out there, generally excited as hell about the creative process. Very few are as excited about the marketing process.<br/><br/>The "one man band" syndrome is probably preventing greater success.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235667/#Comment_235667" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-05T10:35:59+00:00" title="October  5, 2009 10:35AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, are there people who love marketing the way I love every other part of the process?

Specifically, my own experience as artist (which is not limited to just indie rpg publishing) indicates that I (and I suspect others) do not perform optimally as my own marketer. It's simply not psychologically feasible for some reason. Of course this sort of thing seems obvious when we consider how culture industry in general is set up: there is no facet of it in which the artist actually is his own promoter. I wouldn't be surprised if my sentiment were pretty universal, as the sort of attitude you need to create art is not very compatible with the sort you need for marketing it. The marketer needs to have some distance from the work, and he needs to derive his satisfaction from publicity and audience contact instead of the work itself, as the artist does. This way he doesn't just lose interest the minute the work is finished, as happens to me when I work on my own projects.<br/><br/>I also very much support the idea that you don't <i>have</i> to be a one-man production team to be independent. It's pretty simple to just buy the marketing work, which is in fact not that unusual in publishing industry. Of course it's much more difficult to make this happen at the level of commitment and flair we're used to operating on; at least when you do your own marketing you know that the message is solid, you know you can stand behind every word and you know that the thing will get done to your satisfaction in terms of schedule and quality.<br/><br/>It'll be interesting to see if we could have a marketing co-op of some sort develop for the express purpose of fulfilling Matt's new, brave vision. It's tricky to some degree - IPR is already structured towards this sort of direction to such a degree that I'd consider any effort that did less somewhat dubious. Might just be an issue of leadership - perhaps IPR fails in this regard because it's too conservative in its marketing initiative, who knows. It might be that I for one wouldn't even consider seriously any outsider marketing that didn't put its money where its mouth is - and if you're going to buy a block of my stuff for the purpose of remarketing it, how are you different from a distributor or retailer, exactly?<br/><br/>Then again, a good question regarding marketing: can it even be done at a serious level without having it coordinate with the creative stage? Productization seems to be in equal amounts about creating and marketing - how would externalized marketing really work for an artistically independent creator, or would it work at all?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235675/#Comment_235675" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-05T10:45:29+00:00" title="October  5, 2009 10:45AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 5, 2009 10:48AM by Valamir.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree in general with the sentiment that the militantly indie angle has hindered broader and deeper growth in the number of people who are aware and care about what we are doing in our niche of the RPG hobby.  I'm encouraged by experiments like Evil Hat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the big opportunity in the future for our niche (if it is to avoid simply disintegrating into dozens of auteur's whose work is largely irrelevant outside of the handful of people who hear about it) is coming up with a way to gain the advantages of traditional corporate-esque publishers (and there are several) without the inherent conflict of interest issues that the "indie-movement" was born as a reaction to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect if such was easy it would already have been done.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal formulation that I'd love to see, is for someone with the right qualities and qualifications to set themselves as an Agent.  Much like an agent to a musician or actor.  You as my agent get paid to go out and open new market opportunities for me.  You handle the exposure, the marketing, the distribution arrangements, and for that you get a cut.  That way, much like hiring an artist or an editor or a layout person, there's no question where creative control lies and yet that vital job (required in any business that wants to be more than just a vanity art press) gets done...ideally by someone who knows how to do it well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone like say John Stravopolous or Fred Hicks wanted to set themselves up as an RPG agent and run with it...I'd be among the first people to sign up.

Also depends on your marketing message, and your personal definition of "selling out," and a million other things.<br/><br/>I mean I'm not starting a definition war here or anything, but "selling out" is just such a broad notion. Does it mean setting aside your artistic vision in the pursuit of profit? Does it mean actually subverting your own artistic vision in that pursuit?

And possibly Arc Dream (EDIT: NOT Arc Dream, I meant Cubicle Seven).<br/><br/>But yeah, I hear you otherwise. <br/><br/>Personally, I'm not too concerned about proper marketing (other than finding my audience, which I kinda find important, see Maid, Tenra, etc), expanding the cottage industry, etc. I mean, I totally agree with the intent behind Matt's first post: His suggestion as he even says in his own words isn't just Telling You What To Do. Think of his advice more like "Layout Advice": It's true, and taking it to heart may improve your product, but if you don't like it because it doesn't fit with how you envision your product, then you can totally give it the finger.<br/><br/>But then, look at our industry. Maid: The RPG is selling like hotcakes. I can't keep it on the shelves. But put the profits shared by me and Ewen together over one year... I learned about trend-trading and stock options (puts/calls) this January, then started investing my hobby money in it over three months, and turned a continuing profit (something like 30% in the first 3 months)... the amount I made through 2-3 months of trend-trading, complete with bullshit amateur mistakes and flailings, toppled the profits that Ewen and I made on a runaway indie (channel, not truly independent mind) product. Having that in mind, I tend to think of Very Serious Threads about Game Marketing in the same vein as I take Very Serious Threads about Scrapbooking.<br/>(still, if the advice is sound, no one gets hurt, and you can squeeze profits with little effort, I'm totally not judging)<br/><br/>Also, this thread totally made me snap out of it, and come to realize that S-G needs a design forum, finally, even if it's just a design/marketing/wishes--&gt;horses/etc forum. Will put brain on that in a bit. Half of the reason is to get stuff like this in the air that might be lost in the blogoverse. The other half is so that I can get this game design BS offa my front page so that I can focus on the mini AP reports, GM tips, and GM convention stuff.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235778/#Comment_235778" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-05T14:44:16+00:00" title="October  5, 2009  2:44PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I fucking love marketing, I just feel weird about marketing my own stuff unless someone tells me it's okay.

These are (Chronologically in order of publication, alphabetized for tie-breaking):<br/><br/>Polaris<br/>Bliss Stage<br/>Annalise<br/>Mist Robed Gate<br/><br/>Polaris has sold, and continues to sell, very well.<br/>Bliss Stage sold out it's entire initial print run relatively quickly (~250 books in ~4 months, if I recall correctly), and continues to sell PDFs at a steady clip. Moreover, it has recruited more than its fair share of relatively hard core evangelists.<br/>Annalise sells slowly, according to Nathan.<br/>Mist Robed Gate sold out its entire initial print run relatively quickly and has not been reprinted due to monetary constraints on the publisher.<br/><br/>So I'm not seeing strong evidence that, in terms of actual practice, there's any correlation between weak sales and funky edition names. If anything, there's a slight correlation between funky edition names and good sales, but I'd probably put that down to dumb luck rather than any real phenomenon.<br/><br/>(apparently Eppy has a funky edition name for Time and Temp, too.

The "up above the world edition" is something you see, under Ben's name, when you open the book.<br/><br/>And I still remember people asking about it. But less, as it was also a lot less prominent.

It was <b>not </b>in any way a rhetorical question.<br/><br/>I suspect that, on the scene of independent roleplaying game design, <i>some </i>people may indeed conclude that they don't <i>need </i>to do any marketing effort <i>at all</i>. Some other people may then jump in and note that when the former say "not at all" what they actually mean is "not as much as someone else", but really, that's just arguing about words.<br/><br/>People are coming to this discussion carrying some fundamental preconceptions.

So, you're saying that some people will read it the first way I posed, and some will read it the second. That helps clarify for me, thanks. <br/><br/><br/>I think that, broadly speaking, people who would conclude "I do not need to do any marketing at all" have a poor understanding of what marketing means. Not doing any marketing at all means literally not connecting with a single customer and making a sale. <br/><br/>Now, sure, people might be doing not-very-good marketing, and selling to customers. That's ok. Marketing is a resources hog, and requires a lot of time and effort, neither of which a lot of designers have a lot of.<br/><br/><br/>So, pretty clearly, I'm coming down on that question like so: Everyone <i>must</i> conduct marketing. It's totally necessary to have any sales at all. And, of course, that means that people are indeed marketing, with various tactics, with varying levels of success. Cool.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, what I think is happening, again broadly speaking, is that we indie publishers aren't doing very good marketing. In fact, I think it's pretty terrible, and I certainly include my efforts over the years in that.<br/><br/>I find it disappointing that our community would generally view, say, 500 sales in a year or two as a really good success. I view that number of sales, personally, as a failure. I think we lack larger ambition as a cottage industry. And, I think we're generally risk adverse (i.e. we can't afford losing, say, around $1,000).<br/><br/>That's understandable. I'm pretty risk adverse myself. I don't have the immediate resources to lose $1,000, or especially $5,000 in an effort to quadruple that 500 sales into 2,000 (which I'd start to call a success). So, I'm a pretty noisy critic not willing to do much more than complain. <br/><br/>Now, it may boil down to something ugly. It may be the case that moving our "success meter" from 500 sales to 2,000 is actually impossible. That is, that such a market for indie RPGs doesn't exist realistically. What's the limit of the market? Who knows. I sure don't. But, I go on the hunch that 2,000 as a general number is reasonable and possible. <br/><br/>And, I think it means we don't see enough success stories who move the "success meter." Too few people are out there challenging the idea that we should think larger than our current scale. Our current scale is, oh, anywhere from 50 sales to 500 sales is "good." Whereas, I'd much rather see 1,500 to 2,000 sales as "good" and under 500 as small potatoes, even in our niche area.<br/><br/>What I'm suggesting is that our cottage industry is generally happy with its success levels, while I'm not happy with the success levels. And, I understand why publishers are happy. Of course people should be happy with their own self-defined goals. If your goal says 500 sales is "very good," that's fine. I'm not trying to rain on your parade, publishers, if you're absolutely pleased where you're at today.<br/><br/>But, I'm eager to know if there are other people who aren't happy with that success metric. People who are really self-analyzing to figure out <i>what they're doing wrong</i> when they can't reach that 2,000. <br/><br/>I'm one of those people. I think I did a lot of things terribly wrong in creating and marketing my games. I have some ideas about what I think could be done to start confronting this, but I lack the resources to make it happen currently. I will say I'm eager to find like-minded people, because I'm increasingly convinced that practical solutions will require shared resources, team efforts, or even outright partnerships formed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236408/#Comment_236408" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-08T14:45:27+00:00" title="October  8, 2009  2:45PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd totally not be happy with 500 total sales.  That said, I've done very little to market Universalis, and for the last 3 years or so...that very little has turned into absolutely nothing.  Game is available at IPR, I respond to occassional forum threads...that's it.  I could do ALOT more to drive the success of Uni and future projects.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe situation for me is that I make far too much money at my real job for spending my time that way to be worth while.  When I factor in how many hours / how much travel / how much effort would I need to drive another 1000 units of sales ...and then consider...how much money would that actually make me...and then consider everything else I could do with that time...its just not worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think your definition of success Matt is unobtainable.  Unobtainable because it takes far too much effort to get to 2000 sales vs. the minimal effort to get to 200 sales.  BUT 2000 sales ain't life altering.  I can't quit my job and live my current lifestyle on 2000 sales.  I'd need something on the order of 20,000 sales of Universalis PER YEAR before quitting my job to sell Uni full time would be a worth while endeavor for me (factoring in benefit replacement as well as salary and bonus replacement, and a very rough estimate of non reimbursed business expenses). And THAT would still involve a significant lifestyle cut for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would have to down size my life significantly to get by on even 20,000 sales...and that's PER YEAR.  To maintain my current lifestyle with current levels of health benefits, life insurance, 401(k) matches, and other perks...double that at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many hours a week would I have to be able to dedicate to a) marketing Universalis, b) building a pipeline of other designs (designing / testing / publishing) and c) marketing those titles to hit 20,000 year in unit sales.  I think that's pretty much a full time job.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when I look at the decision to stay in my full time job in mainstream America.  Or give up full time job to be game publisher...its a non choice for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if I'm not going to be a FULL time game publisher...how much time am I going to spend being a PART time game publisher.  Well...a minimal number of hours got Universalis close to 300 sales/yr.  How many hours would be required to get Uni to 2000 sales/yr.  My guestimate says A WHOLE LOT MORE.  Is the money from those extra 1700 sales (call it $9,000 before expenses) worth those hours?   Well...no.  If I was interested in putting in that many more hours of work...I could put that many more hours in at my day job and make several times more than that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo where I'm sitting Matt, the 200-500 level of sales as defining success is manageable as a part time thing without intruding into my general life.  Its easily obtainable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 2000 level of sales as defining success requires too much work for too little reward.  And that means "why bother".<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 20,000 level of sales as defining success would require a complete overturning of my life.  And while I can't say I haven't been tempted, I love my discretionary income too much at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\nSooo...shared resources, team efforts, partnerships...yup.

This is a topic that I have been harping on privately for a couple of years now. Nice to see someone else bring it up for a change.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I began working on a revision of The Outsider Chronicles, I was fortunate enough to have Universalis' other creator, Mike Holmes on my Yahoo group. One of the things that he kept asking me is, \u201cWho are you making this for?\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nThat question confused me at first, but the answer finally came to me. I was making the game for myself. It was to satisfy my own ego by showing other game publishers how clever I could be. However, that was not my stated goal. I actually wanted a commercially viable game that would sell well. I hadn't considered what sort of audience I would be selling it to.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in order to accomplish this, I decided to learn what I could about Marketing. During this time I came to the conclusion that I really didn't know what I was doing when it came to making a product that had a chance of being a commercial success. In fact, most small game publishers don't really have a concept of Marketing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom my own observations, many publishers that reach for the brass ring figure that if they publish something that they like to play, then everyone will like it, too. There is nothing wrong with this assumption, but it does lead to products that do almost exactly what a lot of other games are already doing.  This leads to these publishers going after the same audience over and over again, slicing up the pie into ever thinner pieces.<br/>\n<br/>\nUniversalis was my first experience with an Indy game. It was different, it was innovative. I had more fun in that half hour demonstration that I had in two years of D20. I throroughly believe that if it were ever seriously marketed, it would definitely cause a ripple in the gaming industry.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, as Ralph has pointed out, his day job does leave him living quite comfortably and he has no incentive to do such a thing. Designing and publishing games is a hobby for him and he does it for the enjoyment of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of the Indy publishers that I have met seem to fall into this mold. They are doing it for their enjoyment, and the accolades of a small circle of friends and fans.<br/>\n<br/>\nI, on  the other hand, am working two jobs to keep my bills paid. If I can use what I have learned to draw a lucritive income from my own designs, it would make me one of the happiest men on earth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236532/#Comment_236532" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T07:17:09+00:00" title="October  9, 2009  7:17AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent point Keith.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I'm sure some philospher long before me has already pointed out (including one Alfred Doolittle), a comfortable lifestyle is as much of a trap as a benefit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236553/#Comment_236553" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T08:13:45+00:00" title="October  9, 2009  8:13AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an aside:<br><br>When I was working at a crappy chain portrait studio, I was offered big raises and promotions-- towards the end, it was to the tune of one a week or so.
